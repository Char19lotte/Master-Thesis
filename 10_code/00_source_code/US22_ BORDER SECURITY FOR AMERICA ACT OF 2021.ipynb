      "Mr. COLE . Mr. Speaker , it should be easy to agree that securing our southern border is vital for national security . Our next speaker will talk more about H.R . 4828 and the need for vital security improvements as part of an overall strategy to secure and protect the southern border . I yield 3\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from New York ( Mr. Katko ) , the author of the bill , and the ranking Republican member on the Homeland Security Committee . Mr. KATKO . Mr. Speaker , I rise today in opposition to the previous question and in support of immediately considering legislation I introduced with dozens of my colleagues to address the deadly , record- breaking crisis along the southwest border . Specifically , this bill , H.R . 4828 , requires the Department of Homeland Security to secure our Nation 's borders through the immediate renewal of the border wall project that was initiated by the previous administration , major investments in security technologies , and increased hiring of frontline Border Patrol agents and Federal law enforcement officers . The Border Security for America Act is a multifaceted solution to secure our borders and prioritize the safety of Americans . As a result of President Biden 's misguided and destructive border security policies , there were 208,887 encounters along the southwest border in August 2021 . That is a 317 percent increase from the previous year . August was the sixth straight month with more than 170,000 illegal encounters , a trend never before recorded . In a 24-hour period on August 1 of this year , the U.S. Border Patrol encountered over 5,900 individuals from 33 different countries trying to cross the border . This is not seasonal migration from Northern Triangle countries , as this administration would have you believe . This is a self-inflicted disaster stemming from this administration 's destruction of any semblance of border security that began on President Biden 's first day . While many of us thought the border crisis could n't possibly get any worse , just this week over 15,000 migrants illegally surged into Del Rio , Texas . According to the recently departed chief of the Border Patrol , the front line is rapidly losing the situational awareness required to know who and what is entering our homeland . Border Patrol has already intercepted known or suspected terrorists trying to come across the border this year `` at a level we have never seen before . '' Illegal immigration is not the only threat along the border . This year CBP has already seized enough fentanyl at the border to kill every man , woman , and child in the United States seven times over . That is just what we caught at the border . Without adequate resources and personnel , fentanyl and other destructive drugs are able to flood into our communities all over this great Nation and poison our constituents , as has happened in my district in central New York . In addition to ensuring preparedness along the border , the Border Security for America Act would resume construction of the border wall system , requiring the hiring and training of additional officers and agents to maintain an active-duty presence along the southwest border -- something we do n't have right now , an increased number of agricultural specialists , K-9 units , and support officers . We know these policies work and that President Biden 's negligence has already proven dangerous to our national security . That is why this bill has the support of the National Border Patrol Council , which represents 18,000 frontline Border Patrol agents and support staff . We are simply trying to provide the frontline agents with what they are asking for . I often hear my friends on the other side of the aisle , whom I respect , accuse Republicans of complaining about problems without offering solutions . Well , here we are , giving you the opportunity to vote on a strong , commonsense solution to secure our borders and protect our communities . I urge my colleagues to support the security of the United States and to support our frontline men and women by passing this bill . Ms. ROSS . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . Mr. Speaker , the fiscal year 2022 NDAA authorizes funding for cybersecurity investments in people , programs , and technology . It directs the executive branch to establish a cyber-threat information collaboration environment which will facilitate the transmission , sharing , and analysis of cyber-threat information , which is so crucial , particularly at this time . This legislation implements key recommendations of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence by authorizing funding for key AI-related initiatives , including investments in the workforce , emerging technologies research , and support for our small business contractors . Additionally , the legislation authorizes funding to support biological threat reduction programs , requires a publicly available report on threats regarding weapons of mass destruction by China and Russia , and directs a report on biosecurity efforts across the Department of Defense , all needed and crucial investments . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. COLE . Mr. Speaker , I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Texas ( Mr. Burgess ) , my good friend , and a fellow member of the Rules Committee , the Energy and Commerce Committee , and a member of the Budget Committee . Mr. BURGESS . Mr. Speaker , the National Defense Authorization Act includes a provision requiring women now to register for the Selective Service . We all know that men have 30 days from their 18th birthday to register for the Selective Service in case a draft becomes necessary . Of course , we also know the last draft was during the Nixon administration in 1972 . We are fortunate to have an all-volunteer military force , and we know that our citizens unite in times of need . The Selective Service System has outlived its necessity . However , since it remains a requirement , we must not fundamentally change the relationship between the government and the governed by adding a provision to add women to the draft in this massive defense bill . A change of this magnitude requires its own vote by every Member representing their constituents . I supported an amendment to strike this language from the bill by the gentlewoman from Georgia ( Mrs. Greene ) , but unfortunately the Democrats are not permitting its consideration on the floor . I think this is a mistake . I think we should be heard . I think we should be transparent , we should be recorded , and then let 's get on with the business of replacing the Selective Service System . Ms. ROSS . Mr. Speaker , I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas ( Ms. Jackson Lee ) . Ms. JACKSON LEE . Mr. Speaker , I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina for her leadership . Let me make a proclamation here on the floor of the House , that when you have the responsibility of governing , you govern . The President of the United States , President Biden , who believes in transformational government , the House and the Senate , the House under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi , the Senate under the leadership of Chuck Schumer . You govern . Today , we are making an enforced , pointed , and open statement about governing . Let me quickly start with the NDAA , the vehicle that helps the men and [ [ Page H4570 ] ] women who put on the uniform unselfishly on our behalf . I am excited about the increase in quality-of-life dollars , the raise in personnel salaries , the concern about families . I am increasingly excited about cyber protection , and as well that we ask the hard questions about Afghanistan and how we will not see the return of such . But we are not afraid to govern by asking those questions so that we can move forward . I am also excited about recognizing that the quality-of-life issues for our members in the military are important . The Jackson Lee amendments emphasize those points : $ 10 million to fight triple-negative breast cancer impacting our women in the United States military , particularly women of color . $ 2.5 million in PTSD . I have heard many times we give to PTSD , but it keeps growing and growing , and there are those in our constituency , our constituents who need these ongoing services . I have been working on this for a long time . To recognize that we must treat our men and women that go into the United States military academies fairly . Does anyone know that they admit people with speech disorders ? Good for them . But when they graduate , they are not given a command . My amendment , that I hope to become law , will determine that you analyze all of your military students to make sure they have a command when they graduate . I am most excited about one that I will talk about quickly later . And then , of course , we have done so much great work with the momnibus to look at maternal mortality rates for military members traveling around the world . Space debris , to determine how we can remediate the risks and outline plans to reduce the incidence of space debris . To be able to ensure that we stop students from being recruited when they go overseas to be engaged in spy operations . That happens . And we are glad to have that , as well as to begin looking at renaming some of these bases after historic African Americans . Let me quickly say that amendment No . 194 should be one that we all come together on , tracing the history of the service of African Americans in the United States military , particularly in slavery , to recognize that they can be a vital legacy to the United States . The SPEAKER pro tempore . The time of the gentlewoman has expired . Ms. ROSS . Mr. Speaker , I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute . Ms. JACKSON LEE . Mr. Speaker , I will talk further about that as we move into the NDAA , but let me talk about my original premise of governing . The continuing appropriations is crucial , and I support the lifting of the debt ceiling not to spend money , but -- when you have responsibility to govern , you govern -- to pay our bills . Does anyone want to suggest that we should not ? I am looking for a few good men and women on the other side of the aisle that will stand with us as Americans and be responsible to our fellow Americans , governing , so that we can ensure we have a supplemental food program and other aspects of it , but we have to govern . More response to COVID-19 . And finally , it is important to give women back their rights . Roe v. Wade is the law of the land , and we are going to pass that legislation along with my anti-stalking and vigilante bill because people are suffering with the Texas law . It has no place in society . It is a violation of the Constitution of the United States , and it should be quashed , with the Roe v. Wade codification . I ask the other body to support us in that . I ask everyone to support the underlying bills . Mr. COLE . Mr. Speaker , I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas ( Mr. Jackson ) , my good friend , and a distinguished member of the House Armed Services Committee . Mr. JACKSON . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of one of the most important bills that comes before Congress , the NDAA . This year 's NDAA follows the National Defense Strategy by modernizing our military , providing a pay raise for servicemembers , and restoring readiness . This legislation will modernize our nuclear triad , supporting the work done at the Pantex plant in Amarillo . The NDAA also includes provisions that will support Sheppard Air Force Base by funding the new fighter trainer and authorizing military construction for a new child development center . Also included are countless provisions I authored that put servicemembers first and ensure the safety of all soldiers , airmen , marines , and guardians . The NDAA continues efforts on the Future Vertical Lift to make sure we have a rotary aircraft that can operate in future conflicts with China or Russia . As we consider amendments , I hope that this bill remains focused on national security and can be passed in a good-faith manner as we did almost unanimously in committee . Mr. Speaker , I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers for their leadership in putting together a bipartisan defense bill . Ms. ROSS . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . Mr. Speaker , I want to highlight an amendment that is sponsored by several of our colleagues that will be in the NDAA and that we will hear more about this evening and tomorrow . It deals with PFAS , forever chemicals . We have debated issues about PFAS on this floor , but unfortunately members of our armed services sometimes end up being human guinea pigs for these PFAS . This amendment will deal with many of these concerns . It directs the Secretary of Defense to provide DOD medical providers with mandatory training with respect to the potential health effects of PFAS . We have seen this in North Carolina , particularly at Fort Bragg . It requires the EPA to obtain analytical reference standards for PFAS , for the development of protocols and methodologies and enforcement activities . It clarifies the scope of PFAS data reporting from the 2020 NDAA . It amends title III , section 318 to clarify that DOD must comply with safe incineration of PFAS as enacted in section 330 of the NDAA of fiscal year 2020 . It requires the report on DOD progress to comply with EPA safe PFAS disposal guidelines , and it requires that this report be submitted one year after enactment of the act , and it includes that they report to the Committee on Armed Services . { time } 1700 It requires the report to include the actions the DOD has taken to comply with that section . It defines the scope of prohibition to ensure that PFAS materials sent to third-parties for disposal are also covered by the provisions . It expresses the sense of Congress that the Air Force has contaminated real property with PFOS and PFOA chemicals , and it should use existing authority to acquire property and provide relocation assistance . It requires a report detailing contamination sites and acquisition and relocation status . It requires a national primary drinking water regulation for PFAS , and clarifies congressional intent by requiring manufacturers to disclose all PFAS discharges over 100 pounds . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. COLE . Mr. Speaker , I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kentucky ( Mr. Comer ) , my good friend and the distinguished ranking member of the Oversight Committee . Mr. COMER . Mr. Speaker , I rise to speak in opposition to certain PFAS-related provisions that are included in the National Defense Authorization Act . While it is important to provide funding for cleanup , it is also critical that efforts to regulate PFAS do so in a way that defines the chemicals consistently , adequately , and properly as supported by sound science . In this current version of the NDAA , what is defined as PFAS is left open to interpretation or defined under an extremely broad definition . Broad definition risks subjecting thousands of chemicals to unnecessary restrictions and create regulatory uncertainty for numerous products . A few products that could fall under this overly broad definition include lithium ion batteries , semiconductors , refrigerants , and medical devices . These products that could be impacted , provide critical benefits to our military [ [ Page H4571 ] ] and our broader society and should be manufactured in the United States . In the NDAA and with all legislation it is essential that we properly define PFAS up front so that implementing regulations can focus on materials such as PFOA and PFOS where there is scientific consensus for regulation . Throughout bicameral negotiations , I urge the careful consideration of drafting PFAS definitions that are properly focused , targeted , and supported by sound science . Ms. ROSS . Mr. Speaker , I want to point out some additional benefits of this NDAA in dealing with global challenges . H.R . 4350 invests in tools to combat the unprecedented challenge of a global pandemic , racial inequities , and a deepening climate emergency . The NDAA authorizes funding for national defense and prioritizes programs and policies to confront the growing threat of China and Russia . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. COLE . Mr. Speaker , I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from California ( Mr. Obernolte ) , my good friend . Mr. OBERNOLTE . Mr. Speaker , I am deeply concerned that the continuing resolution we are debating this afternoon includes a suspension of the limit on our national debt through the end of next year . Our national debt is already at historic levels . In fact , today our national debt represents about $ 85,000 for every American man , woman , and child , and it is going to get worse . The Congressional Budget Office estimates that at the rate we are going in just a few short years that debt will more than double , and just paying interest on that debt will consume 10 percent of everything our country makes . Every other time we have considered raising this debt ceiling that conversation has been accompanied by a discussion of how we are going to pay that money back . But , unfortunately , that is not occurring today . I have introduced a constitutional amendment that would require the Federal budget to be balanced , which would help us pay down this national debt over time . But absent discussion of getting our fiscal house in order , it is unconscionable to leave that legacy of debt to our children and kick the can down the road . Mr. Speaker , I must urge a `` no '' vote . Ms. ROSS . Mr. Speaker , there are additional wonderful amendments dealing with cybersecurity that are in the NDAA . We will hear again about another cybersecurity training pilot program for the Department of Veterans Affairs for veterans and members of the Armed Forces transitioning from service to civilian life . It creates a registered apprenticeship program at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency focused on cybersecurity and infrastructure security . Both programs will be established in coordination with the Department of Defense . We know that we do not have enough people in civilian life with this cybersecurity training as we face these threats like we saw in my home State of North Carolina with the Colonial Pipeline . Having this transition from DOD to civilian life and having supportive apprenticeship programs will go a long way to fighting cybersecurity . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. COLE . Mr. Speaker , I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from New York ( Mr. Jacobs ) , my good friend . Mr. JACOBS of New York . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of H.R . 4350 , the National Defense Authorization Act . Our Nation faces many challenges in the coming years , from the growing threat of terrorism brought on by our reckless withdrawal from Afghanistan to Chinese aggression . This bill reverses defense cuts proposed by the Biden administration to fund our military and ensure our Nation can counter any threat . It also addresses President Biden 's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan by prohibiting financial support to the Taliban and allocating resources for counterterrorism operations . In addition , it provides our troops a pay raise and supports the procurement of essential equipment . Finally , the bill includes a bill I introduced to improve retention and readiness for providing opportunities for reservists , and the rule makes in order my amendment that will get more small and innovative companies access to DOD contracts . Mr. Speaker , we face numerous challenges both today and in the future . This legislation prioritizes resources for our military at a critical time , and I urge its passage . Ms. ROSS . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. COLE . Mr. Speaker , I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri ( Mr. Smith ) , my very good friend and the distinguished Republican ranking member of the Budget Committee . Mr. SMITH of Missouri . Mr. Speaker , I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for yielding . For months , Democrats have been pursuing a radical partisan agenda that will pile on trillions to our debt , and we are here today where they are asking Republicans to basically help them get a loan . They are pushing the most expensive piece of legislation in the history of the United States with the largest tax increase in the history of the United States . And yet Democrats are demanding we hold the door open so that they can ram through this partisan reckless agenda . The debt limit is a chance for Congress to address government spending , something we have done since 1985 . Sadly , today , the Democrats are playing chicken with a government shutdown by tying the debt ceiling to a CR so they can enact their multi-trillion-dollar partisan tax and spending plan , which currently clocks in at $ 4.3 trillion , no matter the harm it will do , no matter how it will fuel more inflation that is crippling family budgets . Budget Republicans sent a letter to Congressional leaders back in July outlining over half a dozen approaches Congress has taken in the past to address government spending with a debt limit increase . But they have ignored all of our suggestions , because the fact of the matter is my colleagues have one goal in mind , an agenda of more spending , more debt , and more taxes on working-class Americans . Democrats control the White House , they control the Senate , and they control the House . If they want to spend trillions of Americans ' tax dollars , they can stand alone and ask for that loan . But Republicans will not cosign a loan for the Democrats ' reckless agenda that harms working families , fuels more record inflation , and rewards their political allies and donors . Ms. ROSS . Mr. Speaker , I include in the Record a letter from 101 faith-based religious and civil rights organizations expressing their support for H.R . 3755 , the Women 's Health Protection Act . "

      "Mr. COLE . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself the balance of my time . Mr. Speaker , I want to begin by thanking my good friend from North Carolina . We do n't agree obviously on the rule , we do n't agree on every piece of legislation , but I appreciate the civility and the quality of the debate . Mr. Speaker , to me , as I look at both the rule and the underlying legislation , the phrase that immediately comes to my mind is the good , the bad , and the ugly . Let 's start with the good . There is no question that the National Defense Authorization Act is a product of bipartisan cooperation of the highest order on the House Armed Services Committee . Nobody got everything they wanted , but there are a lot of things in there that both sides worked together on to achieve . I particularly want to commend Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers for the manner in which they approached this bill . I want to commend them for the additional $ 25 billion . I know that the chairman did n't support that , but obviously many Democratic Members did . I think that was an important sign that the country is united on the idea that we need to spend more on defense in these very dangerous times . Again , the quality of the compromise and some of the legislation that is included in this is extraordinarily important . The gentlewoman from California ( Ms. Speier ) mentioned the issue of sexual assault . It is addressed in this bill in a bipartisan , thoughtful way . I thank her for her tireless work on that very important subject . I also thank those Members that worked hard to reposition our defense where we focus on our emerging threats , our near-peer threats of China and Russia while also dealing with North Korea , Iran , and the threat of global terrorism . It is a good bill . Not everybody will support it , but I think it will get overwhelming support on both sides of the aisle , and I look forward to voting for it . To me , the bad is H.R . 3755 . I make no bones about it , Mr. Speaker . I am strongly pro-life . I have a 100 percent pro-life voting record . I respect those with a different point of view , but this is not a codification of Roe v. Wade . This is a radical abortion bill that would allow abortion-on-demand in every State under almost any circumstances that the provider of the abortion deems appropriate . Quite frankly , it is an enormous overreach , and it will overturn dozens of State laws in many States all around the country , laws that have been constitutionally approved in the past . That is unfortunate , and I think many on our side that certainly work on women 's health are not going to vote in support of abortion-on-demand . { time } 1715 Mr. Speaker , finally , to me , the continuing resolution unquestionably is the ugly . It is not all ugly . There are actually some good things in there . I actually commend my friends for voting to keep the government open . I would normally do that as well . No partisan debate there , at least not from me . I also very much support the relief for those Americans who have been the victims of natural disasters , which is contained in the bill . That , too , was negotiated by the Committee on Appropriations . It is an appropriate measure . So , too , is the money set aside to help those fleeing from the Taliban , those who worked with our forces in Afghanistan and who now come to our country and to other countries seeking refuge and support . We should honor the commitment and the sacrifice they made on our behalf . We could have passed a bill like that in a united , bipartisan fashion . Indeed , the Committee on Appropriations had essentially negotiated the deal . Then a decision was made by Democratic leadership to interject a debt ceiling resolution without any discussion , any negotiation , any way to lower that debt or offset it or slow it down or reform the process . That is what many of my friends object to . I voted for debt ceiling increases in the past under both Republican and Democratic Presidents . I certainly would be prepared to do so again , but not without addressing some of the drivers of the debt , and certainly not as a sign off on a $ 3.5 trillion reconciliation bill that is on top of our normal appropriations , on top of the bipartisan release given and the coronavirus crisis thus far . That is a stretch too far . My friends know that it wo n't work , yet we are going to kick it over to the Senate , where we know the support is not there . Mr. Speaker , I suspect we will be back on this floor dealing with this matter again , hopefully in a fashion where the two parties can work together and keep the government open and operational . Mr. Speaker , I urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on the previous question and `` no '' on the rule , and I yield back the balance of my time . Ms. ROSS . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself the balance of my time . Following the withdrawal from Afghanistan , we have a solemn duty to provide for our servicemembers and to keep our promise to our Afghan allies . The fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act will do both . This NDAA will also invest in our Nation 's defense by promoting cutting-edge research and development , much of which happens at our institutions of higher education , such as those in North Carolina 's Research Triangle . We also must pass the continuing resolution in order to support our Afghan allies , provide relief to regions recovering from Hurricane Ida and other natural disasters , suspend the debt limit , and keep our government funded . Finally , we must pass the Women 's Health Protection Act to enable women across the country to access reproductive healthcare , including abortion care . I want to highlight a discrepancy between the rhetoric and policies of opponents of reproductive freedom , particularly those from States like mine , including Texas . These opponents claim to be pro-life , to be working to protect families and babies , but almost always , these are the same people who oppose Medicaid expansion , universal childcare , and the expansion of the child tax credit . In the United States today , babies that do not get prenatal care are five times more likely to die than babies that do get prenatal care . Prenatal care is one of the many critical forms of healthcare that Medicaid covers . Medicaid also provides postpartum care coverage to new mothers , and the American Rescue Plan gave States the option to extend that coverage from 60 days to 12 months . Postpartum care is key to protecting new mothers from a variety of serious conditions that can develop after birth . Similarly , universal childcare and the child tax credit are investments in babies and in families . Today , in America , supporting children and families means supporting Medicaid expansion , affordable childcare , tax benefits for families -- all of which are included in the Build Back Better Act . Mr. Speaker , I urge a `` yes '' vote on the rule and the previous question . "
