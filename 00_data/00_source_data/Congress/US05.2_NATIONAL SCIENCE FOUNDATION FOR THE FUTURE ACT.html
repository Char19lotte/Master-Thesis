             NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION FOR THE FUTURE ACT

  Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and 
pass the bill (<a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a>) to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 
2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026 for the National Science Foundation, 
and for other purposes, as amended.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a>

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``National Science Foundation 
     for the Future Act&#x27;&#x27;.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds the following:
       (1) Over the past seven decades, the National Science 
     Foundation has played a critical role in advancing the United 
     States academic research enterprise by supporting fundamental 
     research and education across science and engineering 
     disciplines.
       (2) Discoveries enabled by sustained investment in 
     fundamental research and the education of the United States 
     science and engineering workforce have led to 
     transformational innovations and spawned new industries.
       (3) While the traditional approach to investment in 
     research has delivered myriad benefits to society, a 
     concerted effort is needed to ensure the benefits of 
     federally funded science and engineering are enjoyed by all 
     Americans.
       (4) As countries around the world increase investments in 
     research and STEM education, United States global leadership 
     in science and engineering is eroding, posing significant 
     risks to economic competitiveness, national security, and 
     public well-being.
       (5) To address major societal challenges and sustain United 
     States leadership in innovation, the Federal Government must 
     increase investments in research, broaden participation in 
     the STEM workforce, and bolster collaborations among 
     universities, National Laboratories, field stations and 
     marine laboratories, companies, labor organizations, non-
     profit funders of research, local policymakers, civil 
     societies and stakeholder communities, and international 
     partners.

                             General Leave

  Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks 
and to include extraneous material on <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2025">H.R. 2025</a>, the bill now under 
consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  I rise today in strong support of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a>, the National Science 
Foundation for the Future Act.
  The United States has long been a beacon of excellence in science and 
engineering. We are at a time of markedly increased global competition 
in research and development. However, while we should be cognizant of 
our increasing global competition, we must not be constrained by it. To 
continue to lead, we must chart our own course.
  First and foremost, we must significantly boost funding for science. 
For years, we have allowed billions of dollars of excellent research to 
go unfunded.
  Second, we must fully leverage our STEM talent. We need to empower 
more women, people of color, rural students, and other underrepresented 
groups to contribute.
  Finally, we must ensure the benefits of science are widely shared. We 
are at a critical juncture in our Nation&#x27;s history, and we need to be 
more focused on the role of science in our society.
  Science and technology are powerful tools for helping solve society&#x27;s 
most pressing challenges. But as this pandemic has demonstrated, some 
communities and their needs have long been overlooked. We must give 
voice to a wider range of stakeholders in guiding scientific research.
  For more than seven decades, the National Science Foundation has 
played a critical role in supporting research. Many of the innovations 
that have fueled American prosperity and security would not have been 
possible without NSF-funded science.
  As we look to the agency&#x27;s future, we must seize this opportunity to 
build upon and leverage its strengths. I believe this legislation does 
just that.
  After a decade of flat funding, <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a> provides a much-needed 
increase in funding. The bill sets NSF on a path for steady, 
sustainable growth. The bill addresses challenges at all levels of STEM 
education and training. It supports activities and partnerships to 
broaden participation in NSF-funded projects.
  Finally, this bill establishes a new directorate to accelerate 
progress on emerging technologies and advanced research-driven 
solutions to societal challenges like climate change and inequality.
  This bill is the result of over a year and a half of close, 
bipartisan collaboration. The Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology held multiple hearings and markups to inform its 
development. We incorporated feedback from dozens of stakeholder 
groups, policy experts, and thought leaders. And this is reflected in 
the fact that the bill has been endorsed by 50 scientific societies, 
universities, and industry associations.
  I want to thank Ranking Member Lucas for his partnership in 
developing this legislation. I also want to thank his staff, in 
particular, Jennifer Wickre and Catherine Johnson, for their 
contributions.
  And the Science Committee staff on the Democratic side, I would like 
to thank Dahlia Sokolov and Sara Barber for all of their hard work on 
this bill.
  I also want to thank Speaker Pelosi&#x27;s staff, Kenneth Russell DeGraff 
and Reva Price, for helping to get this bill to the floor today.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1700

  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a>, the National 
Science Foundation for the Future Act.
  This legislation is one of two Science Committee bills under 
consideration today to reinforce America&#x27;s global scientific leadership 
and fend off competition from the Chinese Communist Party.
  Together, the NSF for the Future Act and the Department of Energy 
Science for the Future Act represent a comprehensive and sustainable 
approach to building American competitiveness.
  Before I discuss the specifics of the NSF for the Future Act, I want 
to emphasize why it is so critical we act now to counter the threat 
from the Communist leadership in China and reinvest in American science 
and technology.
  Make no mistake, this is a threat. For years, China has been working 
to steal, both literally and figuratively, our playbook for innovation. 
That is because leading the world in science and technology gives you a 
significant advantage when it comes to national security, 
cybersecurity, and economic growth.
  It is no wonder, then, that we have seen the Chinese Communist Party 
pursue a technological advantage over us through forced acquisitions, 
malign foreign talent programs, and intellectual property theft.
  They are also outspending us, plain and simple. China&#x27;s R&D spending 
increased more than 50 percent between 2011 and 2016. In that same 
period, our investment fell by 12 percent, in absolute terms.
  There is no question, we must act now to redouble our commitment to 
American research and development if we are to remain the global leader 
in science and technology.
  This issue is so important that even our colleagues in the Senate 
have decided to address it. And while some legislative observers have 
noted that their approach to this has been less organized and focused, 
I appreciate that they recognize the urgency of the problem we are 
facing.
  While the Senate chose to tack on countless special interest 
provisions, the House Science Committee approached this in a 
deliberative manner, spending more than a year working with 
stakeholders in government, academia, and industry to identify the best 
way to invest in our research enterprise and support American 
competitiveness.
  The result is two bipartisan bills that significantly increase 
research funding while adding strong protections to keep it safe from 
foreign theft.
  The NSF for the Future Act doubles funding for basic research over 5 
years, investing a total of $78 billion.
  It also includes $13 billion in funding for a new Directorate for 
Science and Engineering Solutions, focused on translating the 
discoveries funded by the foundation into solutions that can be applied 
to national and societal challenges.

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H3203">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H3203">H3203</a></a>]]

  <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a> helps expand our STEM workforce so that, as we create the 
technological jobs of the future, we are also developing American 
workers to fill them. It invests in STEM education at every level, from 
pre-K to post-doc programs, ensuring all Americans have access to high-
quality STEM resources.
  Our bill also expands the geographic diversity of American R&D by 
building research capabilities at minority-serving institutions and 
universities outside of the top 100 research institutions.
  Importantly, the NSF for the Future Act has a strong focus on 
protecting taxpayer-funded research from adversaries like China, 
Russia, and Iran. Among the protections included in the bill is a 
provision that prohibits any grant recipients from participating in 
malign talent recruitment programs, like the Thousand Talents program.
  Protections like these are all the more important as we increase 
investments in our research enterprise.
  <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a> is a strategic and sustainable approach to investing in 
America science and technology. I would like to thank my colleague, 
Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, for all of the work she has done with 
me to get this bill before the floor today.
  At every step in this process, Science Committee Republicans and 
Democrats have worked together to identify the challenges we face and 
craft the strongest possible legislation to support American 
competitiveness. That is due in large part to the chairwoman&#x27;s 
leadership and our shared commitment to making sure America has the 
best research and development enterprise in the world.
  Mr. Speaker, with U.S. leadership in science and technology at risk, 
the U.S. must recommit to supporting basic research, cutting-edge 
facilities, and a thriving domestic STEM workforce.
  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to take action now by 
supporting the NSF for the Future Act, and I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Stevens), the chair of the Subcommittee 
on Research and Technology.
  Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the NSF for the Future 
Act, a bipartisan bill to revitalize one of the most important pillars 
of our Federal Government&#x27;s investments in innovation, the National 
Science Foundation.
  I certainly want to recognize the great work of Chairwoman Johnson 
and Ranking Member Lucas for their leadership in developing this 
forward-looking legislation. I was so proud to help usher it through my 
Subcommittee on Research and Technology.
  The commitment to bipartisan collaboration and engagement with a wide 
range of stakeholders has resulted in a carefully crafted bill that 
provides a much-needed infusion of funding and addresses needs across 
the agency&#x27;s portfolio.
  The NSF for the Future Act has been endorsed by nearly 50 
organizations, including the AFL-CIO, American Society of Civil 
Engineers, the Semiconductor Industry Association, and higher education 
institutions across the country.
  The bill puts forth a suite of sweeping proposals, from scaling up 
preK-12 STEM education research innovations and modernizing higher 
education student training to funding more research infrastructure and 
expanding opportunities to participate in NSF-funded projects.
  The NSF for the Future Act also supports the evolution of the NSF by 
ramping up support for use-inspired and translational research through 
the creation of a partnership-driven, solutions-oriented directorate.
  The National Science Foundation plays a pivotal role in our research 
ecosystem. As the only Federal agency charged with supporting 
fundamental research across all scientific disciplines, we cannot risk 
undermining or diminishing this function. Our capacity to innovate will 
be constrained if we choke off the flow of fundamental research 
dollars.
  As members of the Science Committee, we know all too well what is at 
stake and what we are doing to conduct our due diligence here today. We 
have held hearing after hearing to explore the challenges and 
opportunities for advancing NSF&#x27;s mission through a comprehensive 
reauthorization bill.
  We heard from the NSF&#x27;s director and chair of the National Science 
Board that the agency is poised to take on an infusion of funding and 
an expansion of its mission to deliver the benefits of research to the 
American people.
  We heard from stakeholders all across the country in academia and 
from the private sector and innovation policy experts that the NSF is 
an essential asset that has been squeezed by flat budgets for too long.
  Yes, here today is a bipartisan effort to commit to doubling 
scientific research funding in this country. We all remember the 
headline we got several years ago that diminished the funding for this 
agency, that gave us the projection of a lost generation in scientific 
research, yet here today we are committed to action because innovation 
is the great propellor of this Nation.
  The challenges--the unique challenges that we have faced in the 21st 
century have been bested time and time again because of what we do as 
Americans: We innovate. And I know that all too well as a Member of 
Congress from Michigan dedicated to the production and the patents and 
the hard work to produce results.
  Increasing the budget of the NSF is also not nearly enough. A new 
directorate charged with use-inspired research with a focus on 
expanding opportunities, forging new partnerships, and engagement with 
the public is needed to chart the course forward for this agency. It is 
time.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.&#x27;&#x27;
  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Waltz), the ranking member of the Research and Technology 
Subcommittee.
  Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a>, the NSF for 
the Future Act, which I am proud to be an original cosponsor of, along 
with Chairwoman Johnson, Ranking Member Lucas, and Chairwoman Stevens.
  As ranking member of the Research and Technology Subcommittee, I am 
proud of the process this bill went through to get here today, with 
well over a year&#x27;s work, including meetings, roundtables, legislative 
hearings, and two committee markups.
  The final bill includes over 13 Republican amendments and standalone 
pieces of legislation and 11 recommendations from the House GOP&#x27;s China 
Task Force. It is projected that China surpassed the United States in 
2019, in total research and development spending.
  I would like to thank Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas for 
their leadership throughout this process, which set the tone for 
developing thoughtful legislation.
  <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a> takes important steps in expanding the mission of the 
National Science Foundation to ensure we maintain our edge against 
rising global competition, while protecting the foundation&#x27;s primary 
mission of supporting fundamental research.
  It makes key investments in the STEM workforce to expand the American 
talent pipeline. It supports world-class research facilities, like 
Embry-Riddle, Bethune-Cookman, and Stetson Universities, all of which 
are in my district. It promotes the research needed to develop 
revolutionary technologies that are crucial to our national and 
economic security.
  While making these investments, we also secure taxpayer-funded 
research and technologies from adversaries like the Chinese Communist 
Party.
  The National Science Foundation Inspector General is seeing a 1,000 
percent increase in FBI referrals for research theft inquiries. <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 
2225</a> gives the NSF security office the resources, the authority, and 
the tools for the foundation, for the sponsoring institutions, and for 
the applicants to identify and address malign foreign influence and to 
address research theft.

  The bill also instructs the NSF to develop mandatory security 
training to ensure that individual researchers, frankly, have no more 
excuses and that they understand the threat and the Federal policies 
and guidelines.
  Lastly, Representative Randy Feenstra and I successfully added an 
amendment during the full committee markup that bans grant applicants 
from participating in malign foreign

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H3204">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H3204">H3204</a></a>]]

talent programs, like the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s Thousand Talents 
program.
  It is critical that we strike a balance between keeping our research 
enterprise open, but also protecting it from adversaries who seek to 
take advantage of our open system.
  There is more work to be done, but I think these provisions take some 
big steps in striking that balance.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote for this bill.
  Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. Foster).
  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, today we are considering <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a>, the NSF 
for the Future Act; and <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3593">H.R. 3593</a>, the DOE Science for the Future Act. 
Both are tributes to the thoughtful bipartisanship of the leadership 
and the staff of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, on which 
I have the honor of serving.
  Last Congress, the Science Committee found itself in the remarkable 
position of discussing dueling bipartisan proposals to essentially 
double the science budgets, which, needless to say, represents a big 
change from years past.
  Out of that shared commitment to the future came the thoughtful and 
bipartisan NSF for the Future Act and the DOE Science for the Future 
Act. These bills, which represent significant and overdue increases to 
the budgets for the NSF and the DOE Office of Science, are crucial to 
ensuring that our Nation maintains its leadership in the science that 
will continue to change the world.
  <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a> was specifically written to ensure that the NSF will have 
the funds to accept a much larger fraction of the qualified research 
proposals that it receives every year, which is the single most 
important thing that we can do to ensure the health of the science it 
supports.

                              {time}  1715

  <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3593">H.R. 3593</a> contains aggressive but feasible budget profiles for the 
existing programs of DOE&#x27;s Office of Science. It has specific language 
to reexamine opportunities to expand these programs into new areas 
under these more ambitious but now, hopefully, realistic budget growth 
scenarios so that next-generation projects in fields like nuclear 
fusion, bioinformatics, energy storage, basic energy research, and much 
more can now be contemplated.
  As the only Ph.D. physicist in Congress, I urge my colleagues to 
support these bills, which I am proudly cosponsoring, to provide our 
scientific researchers with the support that they need to lead us into 
the future.
  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa 
(Mr. Feenstra).
  Mr. FEENSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking 
Member Lucas for all the work they have done on this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the National Science 
Foundation for the Future Act. This legislation contains several 
provisions that would help ensure the United States continues to be a 
global leader in science and technology. It invests in critical STEM 
programs and research that will pave the way for new and exciting 
technological developments.
  I am pleased that this legislation also includes a proposal that I 
introduced to protect American intellectual property from falling into 
the wrong hands. My proposal, which passed the Science Committee with 
unanimous support, prevents government-funded researchers from 
participating in projects that are run by so-called foreign countries 
of concern, including China, North Korea, Russia, Iran, and others 
defined by the State Department.
  Taxpayer dollars should not be spent on research that could end up in 
the hands of our competitors or our adversaries. This is especially 
true when it comes to China. My bipartisan proposal stands up to the 
Chinese Communist Party and ensures that our taxpayer dollars are spent 
wisely.
  The NSF for the Future Act also contains language that I have worked 
on with Congressman McNerney to advance precision agriculture 
technology. These provisions aim to bolster research and development in 
precision farming practices, which will help our producers improve 
their efficiency and increase their bottom line.
  In sum, the National Science Foundation for the Future Act includes 
important provisions that will protect American interests and help 
empower our agricultural community.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
  Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren).
  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking 
Member Lucas for their extraordinary bipartisan leadership on these 
bills. These two bills recognize the urgency of Federal scientific 
investment.
  Over the past few decades, Federal spending on R&D flatlined as a 
share of our economy, and it has fallen in absolute terms. Meanwhile, 
global competitors jump-started their economic growth through such 
investments that spur innovation.
  Maintaining our leadership in research and development is arguably 
more important than ever. Now is the time to be bold in our vision of 
what is possible. We shortchange the Nation every year when we refuse 
to fund a rich portfolio of research opportunities.
  I want to talk about the NSF for the Future Act. It is part of the 
remedy, and it strikes the appropriate balance of expanding popular and 
effective projects and programs while expanding the Foundation&#x27;s role 
and mandate to new areas of evolving technologies.
  The approach to the creation of a new directorate outlined in the 
bill sets an appropriate benchmark as we engage with the Senate, and it 
has received overwhelming support from the academic, scientific, and 
business communities.
  We need to make sure we get this right.
  The bill would allow NSF to improve the speed and scale of its core 
mission to advance basic and fundamental research while promoting 
innovative solutions to the challenges we face as a nation.
  We must support this effort, the NSF bill, as well as the Department 
of Energy Science for the Future Act. I strongly urge my colleagues to 
support these two pieces of legislation. I commend the committee for 
its excellent work.
  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. Kim).
  Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 
2225</a>, the NSF for the Future Act, legislation that invests in our 
country&#x27;s future through targeted investments in research and 
innovation at the university level, K-12 STEM education, and the 
development and commercialization of new technologies.
  I am a proud cosponsor of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a>, which provides our country and 
the National Science Foundation with the tools to preserve our 
technological and economic supremacy in the face of the shifting 
patterns of global competitiveness.
  This bipartisan legislation would authorize $50 billion over 5 years 
for American innovation and basic research. Additionally, the 
legislation ensures taxpayer investments in innovation and research are 
protected from theft and espionage by the Chinese Communist Party.
  <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a> also contains important provisions to ensure our country is 
developing a 21st century workforce by investing in STEM education at 
all levels, from pre-K through 12th grades. I am proud to have worked 
with my colleagues, Representative Gwen Moore, Ranking Member Lucas, 
and Chairwoman Johnson, to include my legislation, <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3859">H.R. 3859</a>, the 
Innovations in Informal STEM Learning Act.
  <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3859">H.R. 3859</a> sets up the pre-K through eighth grade informal STEM 
program, which directs the NSF Director to award competitive, merit-
reviewed grants that support student participation in competitions, 
after-school activities, and field experiences related to 
STEM education. Additionally, this legislation would bridge the 
achievement gap for minority and rural students by prioritizing STEM 
education in those communities.

  As our Nation fights to stay ahead as the world leader in innovation, 
science, and technology, we must rely on the strength of our Nation&#x27;s 
diversity. We cannot afford to compete in the 21st century economy and 
against China with one hand tied behind our back.

  I commend Ranking Member Lucas and Chairwoman Johnson&#x27;s leadership 
for reaching a bipartisan agreement on this legislation. I urge my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a>.
  Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Ross).
  Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the NSF for the 
Future Act, a critical piece of legislation that would bolster our 
Nation&#x27;s research enterprise and enhance our status as a world leader 
in science and research. It is so wonderful that it has been done in a 
completely bipartisan way.
  Included in this legislation is a bipartisan bill I introduced, the 
NSF Technology Research Institutes Act. This important bill would 
create a grant program at NSF that will fund technology research 
activities at institutes of higher education. This will further our 
national innovation enterprise and ensure our technology workforce has 
the requisite skill set to work on cutting-edge research as the key to 
success in the 21st century.
  This program will enable our academic institutions, including those I 
represent in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina, to further 
provide their students with critical research experience to build the 
robust technology workforce our country urgently needs.
  I look forward to working with the Senate to ensure this critical 
bill is signed into law.
  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Obernolte), the ranking member of the Investigations 
and Oversight Subcommittee.
  Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a>, 
the National Science Foundation for the Future Act.
  Mr. Speaker, I have been increasingly alarmed over the last few 
months at the foreign-based attacks on our Nation&#x27;s infrastructure. 
Several weeks ago, the attack against Colonial Pipeline disrupted the 
supply of gasoline throughout the East Coast. Also several weeks ago, 
the computer attack against JBS meat processing threatened to disrupt 
our Nation&#x27;s food supply.
  Mr. Speaker, the reason these are particularly concerning to me as a 
computer scientist is the data that indicates that we have seriously 
underinvested in our computer science workforce over the last several 
decades, particularly compared with other countries.
  This bill is a very meaningful step toward solving that problem. It 
would roughly double the NSF&#x27;s investment in basic scientific research 
over the next few years, particularly in fields like computer science.
  It includes a bill that I sponsored, <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3844">H.R. 3844</a>, the Fellowships and 
Traineeships for Early-Career AI Researchers Act, that would make 
meaningful investments in new fellowships and new traineeships to 
enable the next generation of Americans to become educated and skilled 
in the field of artificial intelligence.
  Another bill that we are considering on the floor tonight, the 
Department of Energy Science for the Future Act, would continue those 
investments. It includes another piece of legislation that I authored, 
the Next Generation Computing Research and Development Act, that would 
make meaningful investments in exascale computing and next-generation 
computing capabilities.
  Mr. Speaker, taken together, this legislation will attempt to address 
the problems that have plagued computer science and technical education 
in this country.
  Mr. Speaker, no discussion of this legislation would be complete 
without some praise for the bipartisan path that this legislation has 
followed. This legislation is bipartisan. It includes meaningful 
contributions from both parties. It is deliberate. It has taken place 
over the course of more than a year.
  Mr. Speaker, it is inclusive. It includes input from hundreds of 
different industry and academic institutions.
  Mr. Speaker, this is the path that legislation in this Chamber should 
follow.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a>.
  Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for 
time, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  My colleagues have done a great job today of explaining all the many 
reasons we need to pass the National Science Foundation for the Future 
Act to keep America globally competitive. I thank them for their 
support of this legislation.
  I also want to thank my staff for all the hard work they have done on 
this bill. America&#x27;s scientific and technological competitiveness has 
been my highest priority as ranking member of the Science Committee. My 
staff has worked long and hard to create a smart, strategic approach to 
doubling our investments in research and development, and I appreciate 
all they have done.
  I also want to thank Chairwoman Johnson&#x27;s staff for working so 
closely with us to ensure that we have a bipartisan plan to invest in 
America&#x27;s science and technology leadership.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the NSF for the Future 
Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I simply urge all of my colleagues 
to support the National Science Foundation for the Future Act.
  It is really time to acknowledge that we did have to do a lot of 
extra homework to come to the final portions of this bill, and we did 
it collaboratively. We involved the entire scientific community, and we 
believe we have done a great job.
  I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a>, the National Science Foundation 
for the Future Act, includes my bill, <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3795">H.R. 3795</a>, to ensure educators 
from the Northern Mariana Islands, Virgin Islands, Guam, and American 
Samoa are represented in the annual Presidential Awards for Excellence 
in Math and Science Teaching.
  Established by Congress in 1983, the Presidential Award is the 
highest recognition that an elementary or secondary school mathematics 
or science teacher may receive in the United States. Over 4,800 
teachers have been recognized for their contributions in the classroom 
and to their profession.
  Unlike the fifty States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and 
Department of Defense schools, each of which may recognize a STEM 
educator, no more than two awards in total can go to teachers from the 
four insular areas: the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, 
Guam, and American Samoa. This limitation has resulted in many years in 
which no teacher from one of those four areas is selected. No teacher 
from the Marianas, for instance, was selected last year. And this lack 
of recognition defeats the purpose of the program, which is to inspire 
excellence within each area and provide a role model for other local 
STEM educators to emulate. These statutory limits, also, unfairly deny 
deserving educators in the insular areas the national recognition and 
professional development opportunities we provide to STEM educators 
elsewhere in our nation.
  My bill provides a more equitable process by requiring awards to at 
least one teacher from each of the four areas. By ensuring teachers 
from all parts of America are represented, more students and schools 
will benefit from the expert-led training programs and collaboration 
opportunities available to awardees during their visit to our nation&#x27;s 
capital.
  I thank Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas for all their 
support to include into <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a> this important measure.
  I ask my colleagues to support <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a>.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. -Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in proud support of 
<a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a>, the ``National Science foundation for the Future Act,&#x27;&#x27; 
which authorizes appropriations for the National Science Foundation for 
the next five fiscal years.
  As a former member of the House Science committee, I believe science 
and engineering academic research is an essential investment due to the 
ongoing cybersecurity, national security, and public wellbeing threats 
attacking the Nation.
  The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports basic research that is 
a primary driver of the U.S. economy, enhances the nation&#x27;s security, 
and advances knowledge to sustain global leadership.
  Specifically, the NSF is the only federal agency whose mission 
includes support for fundamental science and engineering fields.
  NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and 
engineering, providing grants and cooperative agreements to more than 
2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H3206">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H3206">H3206</a></a>]]

systems, businesses, informal science organizations, and other research 
organizations throughout the U.S.
  Pursuant to the National Science Foundation for the Future Act, NSF 
will contract with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and 
Medicine to assess the status and opportunities for Pre-K through 12 
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, including computer 
science, (STEM) education research.
  The NSF contributions have specifically benefitted Texas institutions 
by previously investing $46,828,000 to STEM education and $356,731,000 
in fundamental research.
  The National Science Foundation for the Future Act will continue to 
impact Texas STEM education.
  For example, money distributed through the National Science 
Foundation go to University of Houston STEM student researching at The 
University of Houston Division of Research Department.
  In the past, the NSF funding helped researchers at Rice University 
develop a nanotechnology-based ``trap-and-zap&#x27;&#x27; approach to absorbing 
and deactivating antibiotic-resistant genes.
  More importantly the money from the NSF is contributed to the Science 
and Technology Enhancement Program (STEP) at Texas Southern University 
to help increase the number of African-American and female graduates in 
all STEM fields.
  <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a> carries out a national initiative to facilitate the 
development of networks and partnerships to broaden participation in 
STEM studies and careers of historically underrepresented groups like 
students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).
  The funds allocated to STEM programs like Texas Southern University 
contribute to President Biden&#x27;s plan to help build up and financially 
support Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).
  Research has found that HBCUs are vital to helping underrepresented 
students move to the top of the income ladder.
  HBCUs are only three percent of four-year universities, and their 
graduates make up approximately 80 percent of Black judges, half of 
Black lawyers and doctors, and 25 percent of Black undergraduates 
earning STEM degrees.
  President Biden wants us to invest in HBCU&#x27;s by creating or expanding 
educational programs in high-demand fields (e.g., STEM, computer 
sciences, nursing, and allied health), with an additional $2 billion 
directed towards building a pipeline of skilled health care workers 
with graduate degrees.
  Through the American Jobs Plan, President Biden wants to eliminate 
racial and gender inequities in research and development and science, 
technology, engineering, and math.
  President Biden wants to invest $40 billion in upgrading research 
infrastructure in laboratories across the country, including brick-and-
mortar facilities and computing capabilities and networks. These funds 
would be allocated across the federal R&D agencies, including at the 
Department of Energy.
  Half of those funds will be reserved for Historically Black Colleges 
and Universities (HBCUs) and other Minority Serving Institutions, 
including the creation of a new national lab focused on climate that 
will be affiliated with an HBCU.
  <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a> awards the NSF billions of dollars in the next five years 
to address significant societal challenges and sustain United States 
leadership in innovation by increasing investments in research, 
specifically for underrepresented populations, like HBCU students, in 
STEM.
  I urge all Members to join me in voting for <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a>, the &#x27;&#x27;National 
Science foundation for the Future Act,&#x27;&#x27; to ensure that we fund our 
STEM programs to prepare us for the future better.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Johnson) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a>, as amended.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/8">House Resolution 
8</a>, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion 
are postponed.
