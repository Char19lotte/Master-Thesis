First of all , even at this late hour , I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs , the secretariat , and the staff for the good working relationship , cooperation and support . Through this cooperation I think a good comprehensive report was possible . We wrote a report on artificial intelligence in the fields of education , culture and audiovisual media . In this report , we call for a clear ethical framework for the use of AI technology in media to ensure people have access to culturally and linguistically diverse content . Such a framework should also address the misuse of artificial intelligence to spread fake news and disinformation . We need clear rules for AI technologies so that they protect anti-discrimination , gender equality , pluralism and cultural and linguistic diversity . The use of data that reflects existing inequality or discrimination should be excluded when training artificial intelligence . Instead , an inclusive and ethical framework should be developed for the use of datasets that are applied during the deep learning process . There is no doubt that artificial intelligence technologies will encounter us in all areas of life in the future and will certainly also enrich them . However , we must put people at the center of the use of all technology , and especially in the field of education , artificial intelligence technology must be geared towards the human being , who makes the final decision and holds the responsibility in his hands . Nevertheless , I think it is wrong to generally classify the education sector as a high-risk sector in the discussion about artificial intelligence . In the education sector in particular , there are all conceivable ways in which AI can be used . Some carry higher risks , others far lower . Here , however , a clear risk assessment is required and not a generalization of an entire sector in order to be able to classify regulation and security measures depending on the actual current risk . At this point I would also like to remind you of the importance of strengthening digital skills at Union level as a prerequisite for the use of artificial intelligence in education and of the need , above all , to train teachers so that they can adapt to the realities of AI-based Education can adapt and risks from misuse of technology can be reduced . Teachers must always be able to correct decisions made by the AI , such as when grading students . Teachers must never be replaced by AI technologies , and especially not in early childhood education . For the cultural and creative sectors , we call for a coherent vision of the use of artificial intelligence at European level and in the Member States . Algorithm-based content recommendations , especially for video and music streaming services , should not be able to negatively impact cultural and linguistic diversity in the European Union . To this end , specific indicators will be developed to assess diversity and ensure that European works are promoted . In this way , we want to reduce filter bubbles and enable more transparency for consumers , who can then better understand algorithm decisions .

The European Parliament and the European Commission fully recognize the strategic importance of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies for the Union . Artificial intelligence is already transforming our lives and it will continue to have an increasing impact on the way we learn , work and enjoy our free time . However , this change is not without risk . Artificial intelligence technologies are increasingly being used to spread fake news , distort reality , hijack data or even marginalize groups of people . Now is the time to seize the opportunities and meet the challenges . It is time for adaptation and this is precisely where education comes in . Education can help and add a bridge between technological advances and the training needed to use them safely , effectively and ethically . The action plan for digital education exploits the possibilities offered by technologies such as artificial intelligence , virtual reality or robotics . The goal is to scale up successful practices and better understand the ethical , privacy and security implications . It will offer targeted funding and support measures and act as a catalyst to promote a strategic approach to digital education in the Union . Through this plan , we are strengthening digital skills and developing guidelines that will help our Member States support educators , learners , researchers and future innovators , and thus contribute to the development of a successful digital education ecosystem . . For example , we will prepare ethical guidelines on artificial intelligence and the use of data in teaching and learning . I would like to tell you that at this very moment , the call for experts who will form this group has been launched since April 23 . The idea is that they start their work next month , that is to say in June , and to have a first report by the end of this year . Similar guidelines on digital literacy and disinformation will also be developed , to tackle the spread of fake news and disinformation online . Raising awareness is equally important , which is why after the publication of the guidelines , the Commission will support awareness-raising activities aimed at educators and students . At the same time , we are updating the digital skills framework of the action plan , adding artificial intelligence and data skills . This framework defines the skills required for citizens who are digitally competent in the 21st century . Finally , we also support research and innovation in artificial intelligence in education . We have started to explore the use of artificial intelligence and learning analytics in education to support the education system to meet skills needs and trends . Two online artificial intelligence services are being developed right now . However , as highlighted in your report , the impact of digital technologies , such as artificial intelligence , goes far beyond the education and training sector . They also have an impact on the cultural and creative sectors , as well as on the heritage sector . An obvious example is the issue of the control of online streaming services by artificial intelligence , which is mentioned in your report and which generated a lot of interest during a recent online conference entitled `` Diversity and competitiveness of the European sector music '' , which my services organized with experts from the Member States and representatives of the sector . Streaming will fundamentally change the way music reaches consumers . It can create opportunities to build diversity , but it can also favor some artists , languages ​​or genres over others . It is therefore essential to ensure greater transparency in the use of algorithms by streaming services , and fair financial compensation for creators and rights holders . At the same time , digital technologies , such as artificial intelligence , offer new possibilities to make cultural heritage more accessible to all audiences , and also to preserve cultural content . The crisis has also made clearer than ever the need to strengthen the link between digitization , heritage and education as digital possibilities make learning about heritage more accessible . A good example is the Europeana platform , which was able to reach nearly 50,000 schoolchildren with online courses and new platforms during the pandemic . We are also exploring the relationship between digital technologies and cultural heritage , through the Commissionary expert group on cultural heritage , which meets in April to inform Member State representatives of the possibilities offered by the application of artificial intelligence to cultural heritage . With regard to research and innovation , the new project of the program `` Horizon Europe '' includes a new fully dedicated culture cluster , which will at this time support culture and inclusive society and which will help the fields of culture and cultural heritage to benefit from projects dealing with the economic and social impact of technological applications and digital services linked to the evolution of the sector . Finally and lastly , technology also has potential to promote the concept of sustainable cultural tourism . The working group of European experts on sustainable cultural tourism , within the framework of the open method of coordination and in the context of previous work plans for culture , has published a report which includes the first definition of sustainable cultural tourism , as well as recommendations and guidelines for policy makers . I think it is first up to us to see how all these elements can truly serve the recommendations in the report , for which I thank you once again from the bottom of my heart . "

In addition to allowing us to tailor learning, which is of great importance for the future of education systems, it can also influence what information comes to us through social media, thus changing our thinking and decisions. And here is the point where we need to pay particular attention to the development of critical thinking and digital and media literacy. Artificial intelligence must always be based on clear requirements for transparency. Users must always be aware that they are coming into contact with artificial intelligence and understand the basic features of its operation. Member States should therefore pay particular attention to the quality of education, not only in schools, but also in education in society of all ages.
