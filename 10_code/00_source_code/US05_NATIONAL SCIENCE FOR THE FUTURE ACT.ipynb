Madam Speaker , today I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues on the Committee on Science , Space , and Technology , Ranking Member Frank Lucas , and the Research and Technology Subcommittee Chairwoman and Ranking Member , Haley Stevens and Michael Waltz , in introducing the National Science Foundation for the Future Act . Established in 1950 , the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) was born out of hard-earned lessons about the powerful role of science in securing an allied victory in World War II . Propelled by his wartime experience leading the Office of Scientific Research and Development , Vannevar Bush championed the creation of NSF and postwar federal support for science , making the argument that `` advances in science when put to practical use mean more jobs , higher wages , shorter hours , more abundant crops , more leisure for recreation , for study , for learning how to live without the deadening drudgery which has been the burden of the common man for ages past . Advances in science will also bring higher standards of living , will lead to the prevention or cure of diseases , will promote conservation of our limited national resources , and will assure means of defense against aggression . '' That was a lofty vision . One , I am proud to say , the Foundation has largely lived up to throughout its existence . Over the past 70 years , NSF has played a critical role in supporting fundamental research , education , and infrastructure at colleges , universities , and other institutions throughout the country . NSF funding has enabled numerous breakthrough discoveries that have transformed the daily lives of the American people -- from the internet , lithium batteries , and GPS to weather radar , MRI technology , and DNA analysis -- just to name a few . One of the aims of this bill is to empower the agency to do more of what it does best . Years of modest budget growth have resulted in low proposal success rates and stagnant grant sizes . Researchers and peer- reviewers alike are more conservative in this funding environment , feeling pressure to deliver results rather than take big risks . Researchers are also struggling to support graduate students and postdocs and are bogged down preparing multiple grant proposals to increase their chances of being funded . This is no way for the world 's leading scientific enterprise to function . And if we continue on this path , we will cede our scientific leadership , and with it the advantages of developing new industries and setting the global norms for emerging technologies . This bill authorizes a significant increase in the agency 's budget . Funding for the current portfolio of activities is increased by nearly $ 2 billion in year one and grows at an average annual rate of 6 percent , setting the agency on a path to double its budget in 9 years . This bill also pushes the Foundation to continue to evolve . While it is undeniable that the Foundation has a legacy of scientific achievements that have delivered enormous benefits to society , it is important to acknowledge that those benefits have not always been widely shared . Some segments of the public have been left behind by the traditional approach to science and innovation . This bill promotes increased accountability to the public through improvements to the implementation of the Broader Impacts review criterion and a new requirement for researchers to describe the ethical and societal implications of their work . The bill also expands public access to data resulting from NSF-funded research and promotes increased vigilance against threats to research security and integrity . The bill funds centers that will connect NSF STEM education innovations to school districts and teachers , so more students can benefit . It encourages universities to collaborate with the private sector to better align undergraduate STEM education with workforce needs . It raises the bar for mentoring and training of graduate students and postdocs and establishes a pilot program to strengthen the research capacity of emerging research institutions , including minority serving institutions . Finally , this bill establishes a new directorate to promote a solutions-driven approach to research . A central goal of the Directorate for Science and Engineering Solutions ( SES ) is to be more strategic and inclusive in the nature of research collaborations , including by connecting researchers with potential users or beneficiaries of their research from the priority-setting stage through the translation of an innovation into practice . While industry has an important seat at this table , so do local governments and communities that might be affected by the research . The SES Directorate will enable the Foundation to take big risks and experiment with new approaches to accelerate use-inspired and translational research to address society 's major challenges , including climate change and environmental sustainability , global competitiveness in critical technologies , cybersecurity , national security , STEM education and workforce , and social and economic inequality . To fully realize the potential of science to benefit society , we must fund more research on the questions that matter to the American people . We also must ensure this research is , in the words of Vannevar Bush , `` put to practical use . '' Our competitiveness with China and other nations drives much of the national discourse around innovation because our economic and national security depend on our leadership in science and technology . However , competitiveness with China will not be possible if we do not unleash our nation 's STEM talent on the full range challenges we face . Surely the COVID-19 pandemic has laid that bare for all of us . And the fact is , researchers and students are inspired by finding solutions , whether they be scientific or societal challenges . In this bill , we seek to inspire . Over a year of bipartisan collaboration and numerous conversations with a wide range of stakeholders , thought leaders , and policy experts has resulted in the bill we are introducing today . I want to thank the many individuals who took the time to engage with Committee staff and share their perspectives . Their efforts have improved the bill immeasurably . This is a well-vetted bill , but it is by no means the final product . I am committed to a transparent and deliberative process for moving this bill forward . I look forward to continuing to engage with the stakeholder community and with my Committee colleagues through hearings and a markup . Finally , I want to thank Majority Leader Schumer for his leadership in championing an infusion of funding and a bold new vision for the future of NSF . While our approaches to establishing a new directorate differ , we share the same goal . We must dramatically accelerate progress in research and development in this country . I look forward to partnering with Senator Schumer and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in this effort . "

      "General Leave Ms. JOHNSON of Texas . Mr. Speaker , I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R . 2025 , the bill now under consideration . The SPEAKER pro tempore . Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Texas ? There was no objection . Ms. JOHNSON of Texas . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . I rise today in strong support of H.R . 2225 , the National Science Foundation for the Future Act . The United States has long been a beacon of excellence in science and engineering . We are at a time of markedly increased global competition in research and development . However , while we should be cognizant of our increasing global competition , we must not be constrained by it . To continue to lead , we must chart our own course . First and foremost , we must significantly boost funding for science . For years , we have allowed billions of dollars of excellent research to go unfunded . Second , we must fully leverage our STEM talent . We need to empower more women , people of color , rural students , and other underrepresented groups to contribute . Finally , we must ensure the benefits of science are widely shared . We are at a critical juncture in our Nation 's history , and we need to be more focused on the role of science in our society . Science and technology are powerful tools for helping solve society 's most pressing challenges . But as this pandemic has demonstrated , some communities and their needs have long been overlooked . We must give voice to a wider range of stakeholders in guiding scientific research . For more than seven decades , the National Science Foundation has played a critical role in supporting research . Many of the innovations that have fueled American prosperity and security would not have been possible without NSF-funded science . As we look to the agency 's future , we must seize this opportunity to build upon and leverage its strengths . I believe this legislation does just that . After a decade of flat funding , H.R . 2225 provides a much-needed increase in funding . The bill sets NSF on a path for steady , sustainable growth . The bill addresses challenges at all levels of STEM education and training . It supports activities and partnerships to broaden participation in NSF-funded projects . Finally , this bill establishes a new directorate to accelerate progress on emerging technologies and advanced research-driven solutions to societal challenges like climate change and inequality . This bill is the result of over a year and a half of close , bipartisan collaboration . The Committee on Science , Space , and Technology held multiple hearings and markups to inform its development . We incorporated feedback from dozens of stakeholder groups , policy experts , and thought leaders . And this is reflected in the fact that the bill has been endorsed by 50 scientific societies , universities , and industry associations . I want to thank Ranking Member Lucas for his partnership in developing this legislation . I also want to thank his staff , in particular , Jennifer Wickre and Catherine Johnson , for their contributions . And the Science Committee staff on the Democratic side , I would like to thank Dahlia Sokolov and Sara Barber for all of their hard work on this bill . I also want to thank Speaker Pelosi 's staff , Kenneth Russell DeGraff and Reva Price , for helping to get this bill to the floor today . Mr. Speaker , I urge my colleagues to support this bill , and I reserve the balance of my time . { time } 1700 Mr. LUCAS . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . Mr. Speaker , I rise in strong support of H.R . 2225 , the National Science Foundation for the Future Act . This legislation is one of two Science Committee bills under consideration today to reinforce America 's global scientific leadership and fend off competition from the Chinese Communist Party . Together , the NSF for the Future Act and the Department of Energy Science for the Future Act represent a comprehensive and sustainable approach to building American competitiveness . Before I discuss the specifics of the NSF for the Future Act , I want to emphasize why it is so critical we act now to counter the threat from the Communist leadership in China and reinvest in American science and technology . Make no mistake , this is a threat . For years , China has been working to steal , both literally and figuratively , our playbook for innovation . That is because leading the world in science and technology gives you a significant advantage when it comes to national security , cybersecurity , and economic growth . It is no wonder , then , that we have seen the Chinese Communist Party pursue a technological advantage over us through forced acquisitions , malign foreign talent programs , and intellectual property theft . They are also outspending us , plain and simple . China 's R & D spending increased more than 50 percent between 2011 and 2016 . In that same period , our investment fell by 12 percent , in absolute terms . There is no question , we must act now to redouble our commitment to American research and development if we are to remain the global leader in science and technology . This issue is so important that even our colleagues in the Senate have decided to address it . And while some legislative observers have noted that their approach to this has been less organized and focused , I appreciate that they recognize the urgency of the problem we are facing . While the Senate chose to tack on countless special interest provisions , the House Science Committee approached this in a deliberative manner , spending more than a year working with stakeholders in government , academia , and industry to identify the best way to invest in our research enterprise and support American competitiveness . The result is two bipartisan bills that significantly increase research funding while adding strong protections to keep it safe from foreign theft . The NSF for the Future Act doubles funding for basic research over 5 years , investing a total of $ 78 billion . It also includes $ 13 billion in funding for a new Directorate for Science and Engineering Solutions , focused on translating the discoveries funded by the foundation into solutions that can be applied to national and societal challenges . [ [ Page H3203 ] ] H.R . 2225 helps expand our STEM workforce so that , as we create the technological jobs of the future , we are also developing American workers to fill them . It invests in STEM education at every level , from pre-K to post-doc programs , ensuring all Americans have access to high- quality STEM resources . Our bill also expands the geographic diversity of American R & D by building research capabilities at minority-serving institutions and universities outside of the top 100 research institutions . Importantly , the NSF for the Future Act has a strong focus on protecting taxpayer-funded research from adversaries like China , Russia , and Iran . Among the protections included in the bill is a provision that prohibits any grant recipients from participating in malign talent recruitment programs , like the Thousand Talents program . Protections like these are all the more important as we increase investments in our research enterprise . H.R . 2225 is a strategic and sustainable approach to investing in America science and technology . I would like to thank my colleague , Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson , for all of the work she has done with me to get this bill before the floor today . At every step in this process , Science Committee Republicans and Democrats have worked together to identify the challenges we face and craft the strongest possible legislation to support American competitiveness . That is due in large part to the chairwoman 's leadership and our shared commitment to making sure America has the best research and development enterprise in the world . Mr. Speaker , with U.S. leadership in science and technology at risk , the U.S. must recommit to supporting basic research , cutting-edge facilities , and a thriving domestic STEM workforce . Mr. Speaker , I strongly urge my colleagues to take action now by supporting the NSF for the Future Act , and I reserve the balance of my time . Ms. JOHNSON of Texas . Mr. Speaker , I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan ( Ms. Stevens ) , the chair of the Subcommittee on Research and Technology . Ms. STEVENS . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of the NSF for the Future Act , a bipartisan bill to revitalize one of the most important pillars of our Federal Government 's investments in innovation , the National Science Foundation . I certainly want to recognize the great work of Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas for their leadership in developing this forward-looking legislation . I was so proud to help usher it through my Subcommittee on Research and Technology . The commitment to bipartisan collaboration and engagement with a wide range of stakeholders has resulted in a carefully crafted bill that provides a much-needed infusion of funding and addresses needs across the agency 's portfolio . The NSF for the Future Act has been endorsed by nearly 50 organizations , including the AFL-CIO , American Society of Civil Engineers , the Semiconductor Industry Association , and higher education institutions across the country . The bill puts forth a suite of sweeping proposals , from scaling up preK-12 STEM education research innovations and modernizing higher education student training to funding more research infrastructure and expanding opportunities to participate in NSF-funded projects . The NSF for the Future Act also supports the evolution of the NSF by ramping up support for use-inspired and translational research through the creation of a partnership-driven , solutions-oriented directorate . The National Science Foundation plays a pivotal role in our research ecosystem . As the only Federal agency charged with supporting fundamental research across all scientific disciplines , we can not risk undermining or diminishing this function . Our capacity to innovate will be constrained if we choke off the flow of fundamental research dollars . As members of the Science Committee , we know all too well what is at stake and what we are doing to conduct our due diligence here today . We have held hearing after hearing to explore the challenges and opportunities for advancing NSF 's mission through a comprehensive reauthorization bill . We heard from the NSF 's director and chair of the National Science Board that the agency is poised to take on an infusion of funding and an expansion of its mission to deliver the benefits of research to the American people . We heard from stakeholders all across the country in academia and from the private sector and innovation policy experts that the NSF is an essential asset that has been squeezed by flat budgets for too long . Yes , here today is a bipartisan effort to commit to doubling scientific research funding in this country . We all remember the headline we got several years ago that diminished the funding for this agency , that gave us the projection of a lost generation in scientific research , yet here today we are committed to action because innovation is the great propellor of this Nation . The challenges -- the unique challenges that we have faced in the 21st century have been bested time and time again because of what we do as Americans : We innovate . And I know that all too well as a Member of Congress from Michigan dedicated to the production and the patents and the hard work to produce results . Increasing the budget of the NSF is also not nearly enough . A new directorate charged with use-inspired research with a focus on expanding opportunities , forging new partnerships , and engagement with the public is needed to chart the course forward for this agency . It is time . Mr. Speaker , I encourage all of my colleagues to vote `` yes . '' Mr. LUCAS . Mr. Speaker , I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida ( Mr. Waltz ) , the ranking member of the Research and Technology Subcommittee . Mr. WALTZ . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of H.R . 2225 , the NSF for the Future Act , which I am proud to be an original cosponsor of , along with Chairwoman Johnson , Ranking Member Lucas , and Chairwoman Stevens . As ranking member of the Research and Technology Subcommittee , I am proud of the process this bill went through to get here today , with well over a year 's work , including meetings , roundtables , legislative hearings , and two committee markups . The final bill includes over 13 Republican amendments and standalone pieces of legislation and 11 recommendations from the House GOP 's China Task Force . It is projected that China surpassed the United States in 2019 , in total research and development spending . I would like to thank Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas for their leadership throughout this process , which set the tone for developing thoughtful legislation . H.R . 2225 takes important steps in expanding the mission of the National Science Foundation to ensure we maintain our edge against rising global competition , while protecting the foundation 's primary mission of supporting fundamental research . It makes key investments in the STEM workforce to expand the American talent pipeline . It supports world-class research facilities , like Embry-Riddle , Bethune-Cookman , and Stetson Universities , all of which are in my district . It promotes the research needed to develop revolutionary technologies that are crucial to our national and economic security . While making these investments , we also secure taxpayer-funded research and technologies from adversaries like the Chinese Communist Party . The National Science Foundation Inspector General is seeing a 1,000 percent increase in FBI referrals for research theft inquiries . H.R . 2225 gives the NSF security office the resources , the authority , and the tools for the foundation , for the sponsoring institutions , and for the applicants to identify and address malign foreign influence and to address research theft . The bill also instructs the NSF to develop mandatory security training to ensure that individual researchers , frankly , have no more excuses and that they understand the threat and the Federal policies and guidelines . Lastly , Representative Randy Feenstra and I successfully added an amendment during the full committee markup that bans grant applicants from participating in malign foreign [ [ Page H3204 ] ] talent programs , like the Chinese Communist Party 's Thousand Talents program . It is critical that we strike a balance between keeping our research enterprise open , but also protecting it from adversaries who seek to take advantage of our open system . There is more work to be done , but I think these provisions take some big steps in striking that balance . Mr. Speaker , I encourage my colleagues to vote for this bill . Ms. JOHNSON of Texas . Mr. Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois ( Mr. Foster ) . Mr. FOSTER . Mr. Speaker , today we are considering H.R . 2225 , the NSF for the Future Act ; and H.R . 3593 , the DOE Science for the Future Act . Both are tributes to the thoughtful bipartisanship of the leadership and the staff of the Science , Space , and Technology Committee , on which I have the honor of serving . Last Congress , the Science Committee found itself in the remarkable position of discussing dueling bipartisan proposals to essentially double the science budgets , which , needless to say , represents a big change from years past . Out of that shared commitment to the future came the thoughtful and bipartisan NSF for the Future Act and the DOE Science for the Future Act . These bills , which represent significant and overdue increases to the budgets for the NSF and the DOE Office of Science , are crucial to ensuring that our Nation maintains its leadership in the science that will continue to change the world . H.R . 2225 was specifically written to ensure that the NSF will have the funds to accept a much larger fraction of the qualified research proposals that it receives every year , which is the single most important thing that we can do to ensure the health of the science it supports . { time } 1715 H.R . 3593 contains aggressive but feasible budget profiles for the existing programs of DOE 's Office of Science . It has specific language to reexamine opportunities to expand these programs into new areas under these more ambitious but now , hopefully , realistic budget growth scenarios so that next-generation projects in fields like nuclear fusion , bioinformatics , energy storage , basic energy research , and much more can now be contemplated . As the only Ph.D. physicist in Congress , I urge my colleagues to support these bills , which I am proudly cosponsoring , to provide our scientific researchers with the support that they need to lead us into the future . Mr. LUCAS . Mr. Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa ( Mr. Feenstra ) . Mr. FEENSTRA . Mr. Speaker , I thank Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas for all the work they have done on this bill . Mr. Speaker , I rise today in support of the National Science Foundation for the Future Act . This legislation contains several provisions that would help ensure the United States continues to be a global leader in science and technology . It invests in critical STEM programs and research that will pave the way for new and exciting technological developments . I am pleased that this legislation also includes a proposal that I introduced to protect American intellectual property from falling into the wrong hands . My proposal , which passed the Science Committee with unanimous support , prevents government-funded researchers from participating in projects that are run by so-called foreign countries of concern , including China , North Korea , Russia , Iran , and others defined by the State Department . Taxpayer dollars should not be spent on research that could end up in the hands of our competitors or our adversaries . This is especially true when it comes to China . My bipartisan proposal stands up to the Chinese Communist Party and ensures that our taxpayer dollars are spent wisely . The NSF for the Future Act also contains language that I have worked on with Congressman McNerney to advance precision agriculture technology . These provisions aim to bolster research and development in precision farming practices , which will help our producers improve their efficiency and increase their bottom line . In sum , the National Science Foundation for the Future Act includes important provisions that will protect American interests and help empower our agricultural community . Mr. Speaker , I urge my colleagues to support this bill . Ms. JOHNSON of Texas . Mr. Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California ( Ms. Lofgren ) . Ms. LOFGREN . Mr. Speaker , I thank Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas for their extraordinary bipartisan leadership on these bills . These two bills recognize the urgency of Federal scientific investment . Over the past few decades , Federal spending on R & D flatlined as a share of our economy , and it has fallen in absolute terms . Meanwhile , global competitors jump-started their economic growth through such investments that spur innovation . Maintaining our leadership in research and development is arguably more important than ever . Now is the time to be bold in our vision of what is possible . We shortchange the Nation every year when we refuse to fund a rich portfolio of research opportunities . I want to talk about the NSF for the Future Act . It is part of the remedy , and it strikes the appropriate balance of expanding popular and effective projects and programs while expanding the Foundation 's role and mandate to new areas of evolving technologies . The approach to the creation of a new directorate outlined in the bill sets an appropriate benchmark as we engage with the Senate , and it has received overwhelming support from the academic , scientific , and business communities . We need to make sure we get this right . The bill would allow NSF to improve the speed and scale of its core mission to advance basic and fundamental research while promoting innovative solutions to the challenges we face as a nation . We must support this effort , the NSF bill , as well as the Department of Energy Science for the Future Act . I strongly urge my colleagues to support these two pieces of legislation . I commend the committee for its excellent work . Mr. LUCAS . Mr. Speaker , I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California ( Mrs. Kim ) . Mrs. KIM of California . Mr. Speaker , I rise today in support of H.R . 2225 , the NSF for the Future Act , legislation that invests in our country 's future through targeted investments in research and innovation at the university level , K-12 STEM education , and the development and commercialization of new technologies . I am a proud cosponsor of H.R . 2225 , which provides our country and the National Science Foundation with the tools to preserve our technological and economic supremacy in the face of the shifting patterns of global competitiveness . This bipartisan legislation would authorize $ 50 billion over 5 years for American innovation and basic research . Additionally , the legislation ensures taxpayer investments in innovation and research are protected from theft and espionage by the Chinese Communist Party . H.R . 2225 also contains important provisions to ensure our country is developing a 21st century workforce by investing in STEM education at all levels , from pre-K through 12th grades . I am proud to have worked with my colleagues , Representative Gwen Moore , Ranking Member Lucas , and Chairwoman Johnson , to include my legislation , H.R . 3859 , the Innovations in Informal STEM Learning Act . H.R . 3859 sets up the pre-K through eighth grade informal STEM program , which directs the NSF Director to award competitive , merit- reviewed grants that support student participation in competitions , after-school activities , and field experiences related to STEM education . Additionally , this legislation would bridge the achievement gap for minority and rural students by prioritizing STEM education in those communities . As our Nation fights to stay ahead as the world leader in innovation , science , and technology , we must rely on the strength of our Nation 's diversity . We can not afford to compete in the 21st century economy and against China with one hand tied behind our back . [ [ Page H3205 ] ] I commend Ranking Member Lucas and Chairwoman Johnson 's leadership for reaching a bipartisan agreement on this legislation . I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support H.R . 2225 . Ms. JOHNSON of Texas . Mr. Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina ( Ms. Ross ) . Ms. ROSS . Mr. Speaker , I rise today to highlight the NSF for the Future Act , a critical piece of legislation that would bolster our Nation 's research enterprise and enhance our status as a world leader in science and research . It is so wonderful that it has been done in a completely bipartisan way . Included in this legislation is a bipartisan bill I introduced , the NSF Technology Research Institutes Act . This important bill would create a grant program at NSF that will fund technology research activities at institutes of higher education . This will further our national innovation enterprise and ensure our technology workforce has the requisite skill set to work on cutting-edge research as the key to success in the 21st century . This program will enable our academic institutions , including those I represent in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina , to further provide their students with critical research experience to build the robust technology workforce our country urgently needs . I look forward to working with the Senate to ensure this critical bill is signed into law . Mr. LUCAS . Mr. Speaker , I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California ( Mr. Obernolte ) , the ranking member of the Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee . Mr. OBERNOLTE . Mr. Speaker , I rise in strong support of H.R . 2225 , the National Science Foundation for the Future Act . Mr. Speaker , I have been increasingly alarmed over the last few months at the foreign-based attacks on our Nation 's infrastructure . Several weeks ago , the attack against Colonial Pipeline disrupted the supply of gasoline throughout the East Coast . Also several weeks ago , the computer attack against JBS meat processing threatened to disrupt our Nation 's food supply . Mr. Speaker , the reason these are particularly concerning to me as a computer scientist is the data that indicates that we have seriously underinvested in our computer science workforce over the last several decades , particularly compared with other countries . This bill is a very meaningful step toward solving that problem . It would roughly double the NSF 's investment in basic scientific research over the next few years , particularly in fields like computer science . It includes a bill that I sponsored , H.R . 3844 , the Fellowships and Traineeships for Early-Career AI Researchers Act , that would make meaningful investments in new fellowships and new traineeships to enable the next generation of Americans to become educated and skilled in the field of artificial intelligence . Another bill that we are considering on the floor tonight , the Department of Energy Science for the Future Act , would continue those investments . It includes another piece of legislation that I authored , the Next Generation Computing Research and Development Act , that would make meaningful investments in exascale computing and next-generation computing capabilities . Mr. Speaker , taken together , this legislation will attempt to address the problems that have plagued computer science and technical education in this country . Mr. Speaker , no discussion of this legislation would be complete without some praise for the bipartisan path that this legislation has followed . This legislation is bipartisan . It includes meaningful contributions from both parties . It is deliberate . It has taken place over the course of more than a year . Mr. Speaker , it is inclusive . It includes input from hundreds of different industry and academic institutions . Mr. Speaker , this is the path that legislation in this Chamber should follow . Mr. Speaker , I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support H.R . 2225 . Ms. JOHNSON of Texas . Mr. Speaker , I have no further requests for time , and I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. LUCAS . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . My colleagues have done a great job today of explaining all the many reasons we need to pass the National Science Foundation for the Future Act to keep America globally competitive . I thank them for their support of this legislation . I also want to thank my staff for all the hard work they have done on this bill . America 's scientific and technological competitiveness has been my highest priority as ranking member of the Science Committee . My staff has worked long and hard to create a smart , strategic approach to doubling our investments in research and development , and I appreciate all they have done . I also want to thank Chairwoman Johnson 's staff for working so closely with us to ensure that we have a bipartisan plan to invest in America 's science and technology leadership . Mr. Speaker , I urge my colleagues to support the NSF for the Future Act , and I yield back the balance of my time . Ms. JOHNSON of Texas . Mr. Speaker , I simply urge all of my colleagues to support the National Science Foundation for the Future Act . It is really time to acknowledge that we did have to do a lot of extra homework to come to the final portions of this bill , and we did it collaboratively . We involved the entire scientific community , and we believe we have done a great job . I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation , and I yield back the balance of my time . Mr. SABLAN . Mr. Speaker , H.R . 2225 , the National Science Foundation for the Future Act , includes my bill , H.R . 3795 , to ensure educators from the Northern Mariana Islands , Virgin Islands , Guam , and American Samoa are represented in the annual Presidential Awards for Excellence in Math and Science Teaching . Established by Congress in 1983 , the Presidential Award is the highest recognition that an elementary or secondary school mathematics or science teacher may receive in the United States . Over 4,800 teachers have been recognized for their contributions in the classroom and to their profession . Unlike the fifty States , the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico and Department of Defense schools , each of which may recognize a STEM educator , no more than two awards in total can go to teachers from the four insular areas : the Northern Mariana Islands , the Virgin Islands , Guam , and American Samoa . This limitation has resulted in many years in which no teacher from one of those four areas is selected . No teacher from the Marianas , for instance , was selected last year . And this lack of recognition defeats the purpose of the program , which is to inspire excellence within each area and provide a role model for other local STEM educators to emulate . These statutory limits , also , unfairly deny deserving educators in the insular areas the national recognition and professional development opportunities we provide to STEM educators elsewhere in our nation . My bill provides a more equitable process by requiring awards to at least one teacher from each of the four areas . By ensuring teachers from all parts of America are represented , more students and schools will benefit from the expert-led training programs and collaboration opportunities available to awardees during their visit to our nation 's capital . I thank Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas for all their support to include into H.R . 2225 this important measure . I ask my colleagues to support H.R . 2225 . Ms. JACKSON LEE . -Mr. Speaker , I rise to speak in proud support of H.R . 2225 , the `` National Science foundation for the Future Act , '' which authorizes appropriations for the National Science Foundation for the next five fiscal years . As a former member of the House Science committee , I believe science and engineering academic research is an essential investment due to the ongoing cybersecurity , national security , and public wellbeing threats attacking the Nation . The National Science Foundation ( NSF ) supports basic research that is a primary driver of the U.S. economy , enhances the nation 's security , and advances knowledge to sustain global leadership . Specifically , the NSF is the only federal agency whose mission includes support for fundamental science and engineering fields . NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering , providing grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges , universities , K-12 school [ [ Page H3206 ] ] systems , businesses , informal science organizations , and other research organizations throughout the U.S. Pursuant to the National Science Foundation for the Future Act , NSF will contract with the National Academies of Science , Engineering , and Medicine to assess the status and opportunities for Pre-K through 12 science , technology , engineering , and mathematics , including computer science , ( STEM ) education research . The NSF contributions have specifically benefitted Texas institutions by previously investing $ 46,828,000 to STEM education and $ 356,731,000 in fundamental research . The National Science Foundation for the Future Act will continue to impact Texas STEM education . For example , money distributed through the National Science Foundation go to University of Houston STEM student researching at The University of Houston Division of Research Department . In the past , the NSF funding helped researchers at Rice University develop a nanotechnology-based `` trap-and-zap '' approach to absorbing and deactivating antibiotic-resistant genes . More importantly the money from the NSF is contributed to the Science and Technology Enhancement Program ( STEP ) at Texas Southern University to help increase the number of African-American and female graduates in all STEM fields . H.R . 2225 carries out a national initiative to facilitate the development of networks and partnerships to broaden participation in STEM studies and careers of historically underrepresented groups like students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities ( HBCUs ) . The funds allocated to STEM programs like Texas Southern University contribute to President Biden 's plan to help build up and financially support Historically Black Colleges and Universities ( HBCUs ) . Research has found that HBCUs are vital to helping underrepresented students move to the top of the income ladder . HBCUs are only three percent of four-year universities , and their graduates make up approximately 80 percent of Black judges , half of Black lawyers and doctors , and 25 percent of Black undergraduates earning STEM degrees . President Biden wants us to invest in HBCU 's by creating or expanding educational programs in high-demand fields ( e.g. , STEM , computer sciences , nursing , and allied health ) , with an additional $ 2 billion directed towards building a pipeline of skilled health care workers with graduate degrees . Through the American Jobs Plan , President Biden wants to eliminate racial and gender inequities in research and development and science , technology , engineering , and math . President Biden wants to invest $ 40 billion in upgrading research infrastructure in laboratories across the country , including brick-and- mortar facilities and computing capabilities and networks . These funds would be allocated across the federal R & D agencies , including at the Department of Energy .

      "Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin . Mr. Speaker , I rise today in support of legislation reauthorizing funding for the National Science Foundation , HR 2225 , the National Science Foundation for the Future Act . I thank the Chair and Ranking Member for their leadership and hard work to put together this package . I 'm proud to be a cosponsor of this bill to increase much-needed NSF funding while implementing new and creative strategies to improve STEM education and bolster our research and engineering infrastructure . The NSF is a funder of more than 1800 institutions in the US . Given that a quarter of all federal funding is contributed through the Foundation , nearly every student in STEM has been in one way or another supported by the NSF through grants , fellowships , and research opportunities . Despite continuing support from Congress , the reality is that the majority of grant proposals NSF receives are rejected and valuable research projects are never carried out . During an era of tough global competition in the science and technology sector , it is so important that we find effective ways to boost scientific advancements and keep up with a quickly changing world . This bill would authorize increased funding for the next five years , setting our students [ [ Page E712 ] ] and institutions on a sure path to more successful American innovation . In addition to these funding increases , my Science , Space , and Technology colleagues and I have identified important areas of interest that are addressed through new NSF programs and policies to better support our research efforts . Among others , this legislation finds creative ways to boost STEM education from PreK-12 education all the way through graduate school . I am glad that this bill includes an amendment I introduced in committee to give emerging minority-serving institutions access to NSF funding through a merit-based process , to help them build their research capacity and help expose diverse student populations to STEM careers . Though our STEM workforce is some of the most well-equipped in the world , our institutions continue to report drastically low numbers in workplace diversity . Only one in 10 STEM workers are underrepresented people of color , a statistic that does not come close to the racial makeup of the United States . These racial imbalances will not just go away with time . We must put forward serious and concrete solutions to ensure students of color have the same opportunities as their fellow peers to pursue their ambitions . By directly funding these MSls , which includes HBCUs , tribal colleges , Hispanic-serving institutions , and even some community colleges , we can expand their research capabilities and offer people of color more opportunities for a career in science and engineering . Other efforts that I authored which are included in this package include helping ensure NSF funding is helping support critical and groundbreaking water research that can help address local and global water challenges , an effort I authored to help ensure that community colleges , which often serve diverse communities , can also better engage with the NSF , and finally , an effort , with Rep. Young Kim , to address K-8 STEM education in our secondary schools . The earlier we can hook kids in STEM , the better . This is a good bill and I urge my colleagues to support it "
