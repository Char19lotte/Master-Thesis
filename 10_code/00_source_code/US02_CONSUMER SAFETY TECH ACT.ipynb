      "General Leave Mr. PALLONE . Mr. Speaker , I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R . 3723 . The SPEAKER pro tempore . Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey ? There was no objection . Mr. PALLONE . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . Mr. Speaker , I rise to speak in support of H.R . 3723 , the Consumer Safety Technology Act , and I want to begin by thanking Representatives McNerney and Burgess for their leadership on this bill , which they reintroduced this Congress . This legislation will help modernize our consumer protection agencies and encourage the use of advanced technologies , like artificial intelligence and blockchain in support of product safety and consumer protection . These technologies can help the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission improve their operations and more effectively carry out their mission . Technological advances and globalization have greatly expanded the range of consumer products on the market . And as consumers shop online , more and more of these products are being shipped directly to homes . Artificial intelligence could help the CPSC oversee the increasingly complex range of products under its jurisdiction by helping to identify new injury trends and emerging hazards . AI can also help the CPSC monitor online marketplaces for the illegal sale of recalled products . The persistence of recalled products on online third-party marketplaces is a particularly pernicious problem that puts Americans needlessly at risk . For example , months after the dangerous Fisher-Price Rock ` n Play and other infant inclined sleepers were recalled , a Consumer Reports investigation found that these products were still being sold on sites like Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist , even though they had been linked to dozens of infant fatalities . I am hopeful that artificial intelligence can be harnessed here to help eradicate the illegal sale of recalled products on online marketplaces . The CPSC could also use AI to assess the risks of the growing number of imported consumer products entering our country and being sent directly to consumers . This bill incorporates a bill originally introduced by Representative Soto and Guthrie , the Blockchain Innovation Act , and a bill originally introduced by Representatives Davidson and Soto , the Digital Taxonomy Act . As incorporated in this legislation , these bills will help identify ways blockchain technology can be used to further support consumer protection . It will also make sure that scammers and fraudsters do n't get ahead of consumers and law enforcement in the realm of blockchain and digital tokens . Mr. Speaker , finally , I thank Ranking Member Rodgers and Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee Ranking Member Bilirakis for working with us to move this bill ; and as always , to the chairwoman of the subcommittee , the gentlewoman from Illinois ( Ms. Schakowsky ) . Mr. Speaker , I call on my colleagues to support this measure , and I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. BILIRAKIS . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . Mr. Speaker , I rise today in support of H.R . 3723 , the Consumer Safety Technology Act . I thank Representatives Burgess , McNerney , Guthrie , Soto , and Davidson for their leadership on this effort and , of course , our chairman and our ranking member , and our ranking member on the subcommittee , as well as the chairman of the subcommittee . Mr. Speaker , the bipartisan bill directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission to conduct a pilot program to determine how artificial intelligence may be used to advance the agency 's product safety mission . Given the agency 's broad jurisdiction over so many consumer products , efficiently and accurately analyzing data in the marketplace is critical to its effective operation . This bill also includes an important study of how blockchain technology may be used to prevent fraud , increase privacy , and bolster our Nation 's supply chain . This is complementary to the American COMPETE Act that also prioritizes this emerging technology to ensure America leads in the technology and in its development . Furthermore , H.R . 3723 also focuses on digital tokens , which are seeing increased adoption by consumers . The bill targets ways in which we can protect consumers from fraud in the digital token marketplace , a dangerous trend that has recently become more apparent . Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleagues for their important work on this particular piece of legislation , and I urge all my colleagues to support this bill . { time } 1445 Mr. PALLONE . Mr. Speaker , I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California ( Mr. McNerney ) , who is the prime sponsor of this bill . Mr. McNERNEY . Mr. Speaker , I thank the chairman for yielding and for recognizing this legislation . Mr. Speaker , I rise today in support of my legislation , H.R . 3723 , the Consumer Safety Technology Act . H.R . 3723 will encourage the use of emerging technologies , specifically artificial intelligence and blockchains , to help keep consumers safe . It will aid our consumer protection agencies with carrying out their missions . H.R . 3723 incorporates the AI for Consumer Product Safety Act legislation that I authored with Representative Burgess . These provisions direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission , CPSC , to establish a pilot program for the agency to use AI in furtherance of the agency 's work to protect consumers from unsafe products . For example , the CPSC could use artificial intelligence to more quickly and efficiently identify consumer product hazards , such as exploding laptops that have faulty batteries , defective USB chargers , furniture that tips over , and unsafe infant sleeping products . Being able to identify these hazards more quickly will enable the CPSC to [ [ Page H2946 ] ] help also recall products more quickly and , in turn , help save lives . We have heard firsthand from CPSC commissioners when they testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee that artificial intelligence can benefit the agency 's work in serving the American people . I am pleased that last year my legislation , the AI in Government Act , was enacted into law . Among other things , the AI in Government Act establishes an AI Center of Excellence to facilitate adoption of AI technology in the Federal Government . This will provide a central resource within the government to aid agencies with AI adoption and help agencies share best practices . But it is also critical that agencies build up their capacity internally to adopt AI technology . H.R . 3723 will empower the CPSC to do just that . The CPSC 's experience here will also serve as an example for other agencies that are looking to integrate AI in furtherance of their agency 's missions . H.R . 3723 also incorporates the Blockchain Innovation Act introduced by Representative Soto and Guthrie . These provisions will help ensure that we use the benefits of blockchain technology to help stop scams and fraud . Additionally , H.R . 3723 incorporates the Digital Taxonomy Act from Representatives Soto and Davidson . These provisions will help ensure the scammers and fraudsters do n't get ahead of consumers and law enforcement in the realm of blockchain and digital tokens . Mr. Speaker , I thank Representatives Burgess , Soto , Guthrie , and Davidson for their work in H.R . 3723 , and Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member Rodgers for helping to move this important bill . Mr. Speaker , I urge all of my colleagues to support it . Mr. BILIRAKIS . Mr. Speaker , I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas ( Mr. Burgess ) . Mr. BURGESS . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of the legislation with Representative McNerney , H.R . 3723 , the Consumer Safety Technology Act . You know , over my time in the Energy and Commerce Committee , I have made several trips out to the CPSC and observed firsthand how the men and women dedicate their lives to ensuring that consumers have safe products , that consumers have products that are not going to cause harm to the user . And as we approach the anniversary of our Nation 's independence on July 4 , I also have a lot of respect for these same individuals who ensure that our fireworks that are sold at the commercial stands at the side of the road also meet certain specifications . So as we approach Independence Day , it is always a good time to acknowledge the work done by the men and women in the Consumer Product Safety Commission . The bill we are talking about today actually passed the last Congress by a voice vote , but it did fail to advance in the United States Senate . It includes the bill that Mr. McNerney and I introduced , the Artificial Intelligence for Consumer Product Safety legislation , along with , as referenced , the Blockchain Innovation Act and the Digital Taxonomy Act . We are once again considering this bill because this is commonsense legislation that should be signed into law to improve and modernize our consumer protection agencies . The Consumer Product Safety Commission has jurisdiction over 15,000 consumer products . Many of these are purchased online without the consumer reviewing or assessing the product in person . Throughout the time of the pandemic , Americans have sought to fulfill their needs through online shopping , and many companies and small businesses have innovated products to further increase convenience of daily life . The pool of products available to consumers is continually expanding , putting further strain on the Consumer Product Safety Commission to ensure the safety of those products . While technological advances are increasing the number of types of products available for consumption , the Consumer Product Safety Commission can employ advanced technology to assist in that mission . This bill directs the Consumer Safety Product Commission to establish a pilot program to use artificial intelligence for tracking injury trends , identifying consumer product hazards , monitoring the retail marketplace for the sale of recalled products , or identifying unsafe imported consumer products . It is safe to say that when the Consumer Product Safety Commission was created , no one anticipated the sheer volume of material that would be being imported , for which they now have responsibility . Artifical intelligence uses algorithms to quickly automate human functions and to filter and analyze data . Artificial intelligence is already advancing capabilities in multiple sectors to better serve consumers by increasing capacity and enhancing outcomes . As artificial intelligence advances , it should be capable of helping predict fail rates and identifying problems in consumer products before they can significantly impact the market . If we want the United States to stay ahead of China and other global competitors , we must advance and utilize artificial intelligence in all appropriate products and processes . I can think of no better place to implement these capabilities than in the protection of products used every single day by American consumers . Mr. Speaker , I urge colleagues to support this bill . Again , it passed the last Congress in a voice vote . We should advance it today . Mr. PALLONE . Mr. Speaker , I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida ( Mr. Soto ) , another sponsor of the bill from the Energy and Commerce Committee . Mr. SOTO . Mr. Speaker , I thank Chairman Pallone , Chairwoman Schakowsky , Representative McNerney , Ranking Member Rodgers , Ranking Member Bilirakis , and Representative Guthrie for bringing forward these key bills on technology . Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence , blockchain technologies , and cryptocurrency are playing a growing importance in our daily lives and are going to be an economic driver for the 21st century economy . Blockchain , in essence , is a fixed ledger . Once you add data or a transaction , it can not be changed . Therefore , it makes the data have integrity and makes sure that , as we are doing transactions and adding data over the internet , it ca n't be changed and that there is certainty to it . That is why it is so critical . Then once we add AI to analyze this fixed data , we could help solve some of the largest problems that we face as a nation : healthcare , climate change , to be two examples ; the delivery of personal protection equipment during a pandemic . And , of course , cryptocurrency allows for small businesses , in particular , to provide services across the world without the transaction costs of exchanging currencies . It will help with remittances and other ways that we can modernize our economy . It is essential that the United States continue to be a global leader in these emerging technologies to ensure our democratic values remain at the forefront of this technological development . Authoritarian regimes like China and Russia are investing heavily in these areas . It is absolutely critical for the free world to invest and to win the future in these areas . Also , as a responsible global leader , the United States must strike the appropriate balance of providing an environment that fosters innovation while ensuring appropriate consumer protection . That is why I am proud to work with Representative McNerney on H.R . 3723 . It includes parts of the Digital Taxonomy Act and all of the Blockchain Innovation Act . As many of you know , blockchain technology will be helpful in the ways we discussed already . First , H.R . 3639 , the Blockchain Innovation Act , directs the Department of Commerce , in consultation with the FCC , to conduct a study and submit to Congress a report on the state of blockchain technology in commerce , including its use to reduce fraud and increase security . Mr. Speaker , I thank Representative Guthrie for cosponsoring and co- introducing this bill . This is a first step toward a long-term goal of setting up a Blockchain Center of Excellence in the Department of Commerce . In addition , the Digital Taxonomy Act requires a similar report from the FCC to report recommendations on deceptive practices , and the relationship between the FTC , FCC , and the CFTC . [ [ Page H2947 ] ] Mr. Speaker , I thank Representative Davidson for his cosponsorship . When we look at market volatility , the use of cryptocurrency for ransomware in recent attacks like the Colonial Pipeline and tax evasion , it is critical that we get in on the front end of this . Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to work with Representative McNerney , and I urge support for H.R . 3723 . Mr. BILIRAKIS . Mr. Speaker , I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Arizona ( Mrs. Lesko ) , an important member of the Energy and Commerce full committee and also the subcommittee . Mrs. LESKO . Mr. Speaker , I thank the gentleman from Florida ( Mr. Bilirakis ) for yielding to me . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of H.R . 3723 , the Consumer Safety Technology Act . This is important legislation that helps the U.S. solidify its position as a world leader in technology and innovation while protecting our constituents . This legislation builds on the American COMPETE Act , which sought to remove burdensome regulatory barriers to promote American innovation and consider how safely using artificial intelligence can transform the future . This is also a critical step in maintaining our global competitive edge in emerging technologies over foreign adversaries like China . It will make us less reliant on these bad actors for important technologies . The Consumer Safety and Technology Act establishes a pilot program to explore how to safely use artificial intelligence to protect consumers from unsafe products while advancing cutting-edge American innovation . Mr. Speaker , I urge my colleagues to support this legislation . Mr. PALLONE . Mr. Speaker , I yield 3 minutes to gentlewoman from Illinois ( Ms. Schakowsky ) , the chairwoman of the subcommittee . Ms. SCHAKOWSKY . Mr. Speaker , I thank the authors of this bipartisan legislation , Representatives McNerney , Burgess , Soto , Guthrie , and Davidson . Mr. Speaker , the Federal Government should put the incredible technological innovation of the last few years to work for the American people , and that is exactly what this bill does . It promotes the use of artificial intelligence in product safety and studies how blockchain can protect consumers . { time } 1500 Regulators will be stronger and the American consumer safer when we consider how these technologies can help them achieve this mission . Part of the mission of the Federal Trade Commission is to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive business practices . It is important to keep track of any such practices in the digital token ecosystem where unscrupulous businesspeople may be seeking to take advantage of the vast wealth created by digital tokens . This bill directs the Federal Trade Commission to report on its work keeping users of the digital token system safe . Emerging technologies pose both perils and promise . That is why we must direct Federal agencies to make sure that consumers are safe . Mr. BILIRAKIS . Mr. Speaker , I have no other speakers . Mr. Speaker , this is a very important bill . We have to get it past the finish line this time . I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill , and I yield back the balance of my time . Mr. PALLONE . Mr. Speaker , I also urge support for this bill , and I yield back the balance of my time . The SPEAKER pro tempore . The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey ( Mr. Pallone ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill , H.R . 3723 . The question was taken . The SPEAKER pro tempore . In the opinion of the Chair , two-thirds being in the affirmative , the ayes have it . Mr. ROSENDALE . Mr. Speaker , on that I demand the yeas and nays . The SPEAKER pro tempore . Pursuant to section 3 ( s ) of House Resolution 8 , the yeas and nays are ordered . Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX , further proceedings on this motion are postponed . "
