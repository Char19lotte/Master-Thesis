      "Mr. PAUL . Mr. President , our Founding Fathers believed strongly in the civilian control of our military . Having escaped from the tyranny of the British crown , they did not want the powers of government and military to be fused . In America , the people would control their Armed Forces . This standard has endured , and was enshrined in law in 1947 . Congress had to pass a waiver to the 1947 law in 2017 , and we are being asked to do it again in 2021 . I hope that this is the last time Congress will be asked to pass such a waiver . Civilian control of the military goes beyond the basic question of how long ago a nominee wore the uniform . It is also a question of whether the nominee is enmeshed in the interests of our vast defense contracting industry , an industry whose bottom line depends on an expansive American military posture and , with it , an ever-growing defense budget . Going from firing the missiles to selling the missiles is technically a move into a civilian role , but nothing more . It is every bit as corrosive to the principle of civilian rule for the head of the Pentagon to churn from the military to the boardroom to the Pentagon , working with many of the same people at every step along the way . General Austin retired from the Army in 2016 , and he immediately joined the board of United Technologies , which was acquired by Raytheon . He was very well-compensated for his work there , and is reportedly due a buy-out of up to $ 1.7 million when he leaves Raytheon and his other work and returns to the Pentagon . All we are doing by confirming these types of nominees , no matter their other qualifications , is tightening the ever-increasing bonds between the military and the contractors who serve it . It is getting hard to see where one stops and the other begins . No pledge of recusal from a nominee will solve this larger problem . We are not limited to selecting our Secretary of Defense from the world of defense contractors , and our country would be better off if we stopped . However , with regard to experience and expertise , I do not question General Austin 's qualifications and will vote to allow the President his choice . Mrs. FEINSTEIN . Mr. President , I rise today in support of General Lloyd Austin 's confirmation to be Secretary of Defense , and I urge my colleagues to support his nomination in the vote we are about to take . General Austin has proven through his 41-year military career that he is extremely capable of leading our military as they confront multiple challenges . First , General Austin is a proven leader that will provide stability within our military ranks . After 4 years of tumultuous leadership under the Trump administration , our troops deserve a steady hand to lead them in the defense of our Nation . Moreover , our allies need a Secretary of Defense who speaks reliably on behalf of the President . Second , General Austin brings a wealth of experience to counter global defense challenges . He oversaw U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq , served as a Vice Chief of Staff of the Army where he worked to increase diversity in the highest ranks of our military , and commanded U.S. Central Command in its fight against ISIS and other regional threats . Third , General Austin 's previous appointments to the Joint Staff and as Vice Chief of Staff of the Army prepared him to tackle strategic issues in the Department of Defense . He has committed to filling key positions with personnel that bring civilian expertise , [ [ Page S98 ] ] a sign he fully respects civilian control of the military . Finally , our country faces several threats that President Biden 's administration must address immediately . General Austin 's intimate knowledge of our military will allow him to hit the ground running at the Department and make wise investments that deter global aggressors . I especially welcome General Austin 's pledge to support our country 's pandemic response efforts , such as helping with the distribution of vaccines nationwide . Through his leadership , the military can provide much needed medical and logistical support to counter the COVID pandemic . We are facing an unprecedented set of national security challenges , both at home and overseas . I have full confidence in General Austin 's ability to help us overcome these challenges , and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of his confirmation . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The Senator from Rhode Island . Mr. REED . Mr. President , it is my understanding that Chairman Inhofe is in route to provide his comments , and I just want to begin by thanking him for his tremendous leadership . Without his dedication to a bipartisan , thoughtful process , we would not be here today , and it is the hallmark of his leadership throughout the years we have worked together . I anticipate his arrival . The PRESIDING OFFICER . Duly noted . Mr. REED . In order to expedite the vote , I will proceed . Mr. President , I rise to express my support for the confirmation of Lloyd Austin to be the Secretary of Defense of the United States . General Austin is an exceptionally qualified leader with a long and distinguished career in the U.S. military . He has served at the highest echelons of the Army and capped his service as the commander of U.S. Central Command . His character and integrity are unquestioned , and he possesses the knowledge and skills to effectively lead the Pentagon . The United States faces many complex security threats . If confirmed as Secretary of Defense , General Austin will lead the Department during a time when U.S. strategic priorities have shifted to focus increasingly on near-peer competition with China and Russia . The Department must also transform how it operates with an increased focus on critical technologies like artificial intelligence , quantum computing , biotechnology , and cyber security , while also emphasizing rapid delivery of advanced new weapons systems on timelines that keep pace with technological change . In addition , President Biden must address the urgent and dire challenges that few of us would have anticipated 4 years ago . Our country is in the midst of a pandemic that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and infected millions more and resulted in billions in economic damage , and the virus is still not under control . Recently , it was revealed that large segments of the Federal Government and major companies were hacked by Russia . We are still trying to ascertain the extent of the breach , but it could be the most significant cyber intrusion in the history of our country or perhaps the world . This event , too , should prompt us to move promptly to fill Cabinet positions that are critical to our national security . Unfortunately , the Department of Defense is adrift and in desperate need of steadfast leadership . Over the course of the past 4 years , there has been repeated turnover at senior levels of the Department and a concerted effort to purposefully leave multiple civilian offices unfilled , necessitating the installment of career or midlevel officials into positions in an acting capacity . Unlike other nominees for Cabinet positions , Congress must provide , as Senator McConnell indicated , an exception for General Austin to serve as Secretary of Defense . Under the current statute , individuals are prohibited from appointment if they are within 7 years of military service . Congress found itself in a similar situation 4 years ago when President Trump nominated Gen. James Mattis to be the Secretary of Defense . Prior to General Austin 's confirmation hearing , the Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing on civilian control of the Armed Forces that focused on the erosion of civil-military relations . At the hearing , valid concerns were raised about providing another waiver so soon after Secretary Mattis . However , at his nomination hearing earlier this week , General Austin pledged his commitment to repairing civil- military relations while also empowering civilian personnel within the Department of Defense . These are critical commitments by General Austin and ones that I support . Therefore , yesterday I voted in favor of the legislation to provide General Austin with an exception to serve as Secretary of Defense , and I was pleased the legislation received strong bipartisan support . General Austin is an outstanding choice to serve as Secretary of Defense . I am proud to support his nomination , given the unique challenges we face . I think from now on , in a few moments , we can refer to him as Secretary Austin , which is the appropriate title for his role . With that , I yield the floor to my colleague , the chairman . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The senior Senator from Oklahoma . Mr. INHOFE . Mr. President , yesterday I had the opportunity to respond to the majority on my support for Tony Blinken to be the Secretary of State . He is someone I have known for a long period of time . I think we will see that with the new administration here and myself being a conservative Republican , there will be some appointments that I will not really be excited about and agree with , in which case I will state it . But in the case of the Secretary of State , I expressed myself yesterday and I want to do it again today for what I consider to be a really critical first appointment -- second appointment that the new administration makes , and that would be for General Austin to be the person in charge at a time that is very unique . I agree with the Senator who just spoke about the qualities of this general . We know that he rose through the ranks through the Army to become the first four-star general and commander of Central Command from 2013 to 2016 . He has done everything right . We , right now -- I know the Presiding Officer is aware of this and certainly the ranking member of the committee is aware of this -- we are in the most threatening times that we have ever been in . We have China and Russia out there with capabilities that we did n't really believe we would find ourselves with . So that is going to be the primary concern of this new administration , and I ca n't think of a better person to take the helm than General Austin to provide the leadership . And it is true that we had to have a waiver yesterday . That waiver was overwhelmingly supported in a bipartisan way . So everyone knows that we gave a lot of thought to it . And this is at a time where we really needed someone with the background of General Austin to take that position , and I strongly support it and look forward to serving with him . I yield the floor .
