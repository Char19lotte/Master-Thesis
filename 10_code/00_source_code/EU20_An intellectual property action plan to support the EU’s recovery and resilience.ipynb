This report identifies existing problem situations and proposes solutions .

For these reasons , all member states involved should make increased efforts to ratify the Convention on the Unified Patent Jurisdiction so that the unitary patent package can finally enter into force . Furthermore , the enforcement of intellectual property rights needs to be significantly improved . Counterfeit goods result in around 416,000 direct job losses every year . Counterfeit products can not only significantly affect the health of citizens - for example in the case of counterfeit masks . They are also often linked to organized crime .

      "Mariya Gabriel , Member of the Commission . – Mr President , first , we would like to thank Parliament for its report on an intellectual property action plan to support the EU ’ s recovery and resilience . The report has well captured the importance of a balanced protection of intellectual property rights for the EU ’ s recovery and resilience , but also for the European economy and in particular SMEs . As requested by Parliament , the Commission will step up efforts in the areas of SMEs and IP management . The Commission and the European Union Intellectual Property Office will launch a new European SME fund for the next three years – 2022 to 2024 – and this fund will offer more services such as the reimbursement of international trademark and national registration fees for patents . On patents , the Commission is pleased with the strong support expressed by Parliament on the rolling—out of the Unitary Patent system , which is expected to start operating by the end of next year , 2022 . The Commission will continue working on improving the European Patent framework . First , the Commission agrees that the equitable distribution of vaccines around the globe is essential for effectively combating the spread of COVID—19 and that , to address supply chains , the way forward is to facilitate cross—border trade and support technology transfer based on the voluntary licensing of IP rights . The Commission also stands ready to take the necessary steps to ensure access to critical IP in times of crisis , including by facilitating the use of compulsory licensing in the absence of voluntary licenses . Second , to correct the fragmentation issues identified by the European Parliament report as regards the need for a Unitary Supplementary Protection Certificate to be on par with the Unitary Patent , the Commission has announced a legislative initiative for next year . The Commission will analyse the most adequate institutional actors for the examination and granting . Finally , as regards standard essential patents , the Commission welcomes the European Parliament ’ s call for enhancing transparency and fostering good faith licensing negotiations . The reform announced by the Commission will aim at addressing those issues . In the field of geographical indications , we take note of the call for simplification and not to overburden farmers with administration . In this regard , we aim to make the scheme more attractive and accessible to farmers across the Union and boost protection of geographical indications on the internet , in particular . For non—agricultural products or so—called craft and industrial products , the Commission welcomes Parliament ’ s support for the establishment of efficient and transparent European sui generis protection of geographical indications at European level for craft and industrial products . Let me reassure you that the Commission is working at full steam on finalising a thorough impact assessment , which is a prerequisite to a proposal in this field . Next year , we will also present proposals on designs to modernise design protection systems , to support the digital and green transitions and become more accessible and efficient , in particular for SMEs . One of our main objectives is to complete the single market for repair spare parts to the benefit of competition and lower prices for consumers . Let me also reassure you that the fight against counterfeit goods , such as pharmaceutical and medical devices and toys , remains very high on the Commission ’ s agenda . Counterfeit goods not only have negative economic impacts on European economic growth , they also mislead consumers and puts their health and safety at risk and could be detrimental to the environment . Organised crime groups are also heavily involved in counterfeiting . The EU Toolbox against Counterfeiting is a unique opportunity for the EU to single out an overarching , effective policy for all relevant stakeholders and public authorities , to curb counterfeiting both online and offline . The toolbox will build on the existing and future horizontal European initiatives , in particular the Digital Services Act , the EU Strategy to tackle organised crime and the European customs action plan . It will also build on existing industry—led initiatives . The European Parliament report highlights new challenges for IP policymaking , such as the use of artificial intelligence technologies in supporting the creation of new designs , medicines or vaccines . While we believe that the overall system is fit for these challenges , the Commission will continue to assess the issues presented by Parliament . The Commission welcomes Parliament ’ s call for the transposition of the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market without delay . The swift implementation of the new directive will benefit creative industries and citizens and ensure more fairness and clarity when copyrighted content is used online . So far , only a few Member States have communicated national transposition measures , and the Commission has opened infringement procedures . The Commission also welcomes Parliament ’ s support for the review of the Database Directive . The Commission has announced a review alongside the upcoming Data Act . Through a targeted review of the Database Directive , the Commission wants to make sure that the directive will not pose an obstacle to data use and sharing , primarily by clarifying the status of machine—generated data . So I ’ d like to thank you again for the thorough assessment of our IP action plan and the valuable and supportive comments you provided .
