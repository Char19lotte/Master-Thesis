      "Josep Borrell Fontelles , Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy . – Mr President , honourable Members of the European Parliament , we certainly all agree that the US remains the European Union ’ s closest and most important strategic partner . It is like this and it has to continue being like this . There should be no doubt about that . This year you launch the renewed Joint Transatlantic Agenda , after a very successful European Union summit with the US , and there have been strong partnerships and engagement with the US administration , certainly much more , in a better way , than in the previous one . Transatlantic partnership is vital and irreplaceable , but we need to place it on a stronger footing . August has been a wake—up call and there are changes in American society that have been in the making for many years that will certainly affect the role of the US in the world . After Afghanistan , the US has been sending a clear message about how they want to reorder their priorities , mainly facing China , and we should be ready to adapt to this new situation and shoulder our part of the burden to keep peace and security in the world . I had regular discussions with Secretary Blinken during the UN General Assembly ( UNGA ) week , and I will travel to Washington next week to meet him again . He is in Paris today and I will be in Washington next week , so our links will be increasingly important and hopefully will deliver . These meetings are important for our ongoing discussions on issues related to the transatlantic agenda that have to be put in the frame of the developments in the world because we have to think about how the 21st century will be . Will the 21st century be born on Tiananmen or will it be born on the fall of the Berlin Wall ? These two events – so different – mark the different paths of the future , how the future will be . We will be depending on our capacity to strengthen the trans-Atlantic relationship in order to defend democracies in the world . I take note of the references in your report to the need to foster greater self—reliance in matters of defence . On this point of view , I ’ m going to jump to French . We must recognize the strategic importance of the engagement that President Biden made with President Macron during a conversation that was perhaps short , but undoubtedly very important about the Indo-Pacific region , including in the strategic framework that the European Union has just published on this region of the world . As part of the fight against terrorism , the United States has pledged to strengthen its support for counterterrorism operations in the Sahel led by European states . In this communication , the United States also recognized the importance of a stronger and more efficient European defense , which contributes positively to transatlantic security , in complementarity with NATO . Yes , the Euro-Atlantic area is at the heart of NATO . NATO is the fundamental tool of our collective defence . But the management of crises in the European neighborhood must concern us , the Europeans , in the first place . This communication opens the door to future developments , which the Heads of State or Government will discuss this evening in Slovenia and which will be followed by the presentation of the strategic compass in November . These steps will strengthen our collective commitment to the US crisis management and enhance , as the report points out , our instruments and mechanisms . We are working on a new joint EU—NATO statement by the end of the year to renew those of 2016 and 2018 , but our dialogue with the US is not only in the framework of NATO because not all European Member States are members of NATO and there are many NATO members who are not European Union Member States . So we have to have a direct and complementary relationship and a US—EU strategic dialogue . We discussed with Secretary Blinken in the UN General Assembly about how this dialogue and cooperation can be strengthened . We agreed on the need to put in place a system to avoid issues like the one around the AUKUS pact between Australia , the UK and the USA in the future and , as your report recommends , we must also launch a dedicated dialogue on security and defence . Certainly , we also call for a closer transatlantic foreign policy coordination and you can rest assured that we will continue to cooperate and partner with the US in key foreign and security policy areas , mainly in front of the development of China , both from the economic , political and military point of view . But , as President Biden also said in his United Nations speech , we are not willing to restart a new cold war with China . Also in the Western Balkans , I have to say that our cooperation with the US is much better . The recent crisis between Kosovo and Serbia has been solved thanks to the good work of our special envoy , Miroslav Lajčák . I have to say that our cooperation with the US envoy has been very positive . We also report on the significance of the transatlantic economic relationship . We had a successful inauguration of the Trade and Technology Council in Pittsburgh and it is clear that we now have a framework with the potential to make joint progress on global economic and technological challenges . I think that it is very important to seize this opportunity because the world of tomorrow will be shaped around technological developments . Who masters technology will master power , and at that moment we Europeans will need to develop our technological capacities much more quickly . This can be better done together with the US , but not without also talking about the issues on which we can disagree . There are some difficult issues : to secure the change of supply in the field of semiconductors , to be sure that we are not going to create in the future an overcapacity , to talk about tariffs , data protection , and artificial intelligence . These are an incredibly broad set of issues that will shape the future and on which we have to engage more with the US . A last word about COP26 . We look forward to continuing our close coordination with the US to get every country to do more to fight climate change . Yesterday , I was in Saudi Arabia talking about it . It was sometimes a difficult discussion because we Europeans only have eight per cent of global emissions . Even if we cancel them tomorrow – zero emissions – the problem would be the same . The remaining 92 % would still be there . So we have to work together with the US , especially on the recently announced Global Methane Pledge , because we talk about CO2 but there are other gases which also have a strong capacity to destroy the atmosphere , and methane is one of these . This Global Methane Pledge will be another occasion for us to cooperate with the US on climate change . In September , our Executive Vice—President Timmermans and US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate Kerry co-chaired the second meeting of the High—Level Climate Action Group , which is one of the key deliverables of our EU—US summit . Finally – and it really is finally – let me underline that the recent announcement on the lifting of travel restrictions , Croatia ’ s access to the visa waiver programme and the launch of the joint COVID-19 Manufacturing and Supply Chain Taskforce , thanks to the good work of Commissioner Breton , are also positive developments linked to our joint agenda that will benefit the whole world . Because if we , the US and the EU , work together , the world will be vaccinated more quickly . In conclusion , the recommendations that you make in your report are very timely . It is a long report that has a lot of issues in it . Our relationship with the US is certainly the stronger pillar , our freedom and prosperity . We have to continue building on it but , at the same time , we have to continue building our autonomy because our interests will not always exactly coincide . This report is very timely . I thank the rapporteurs for that . I thank the Members in this debate for their contribution to what they can do on this very important issue . "

In the interest of our common ideals, it is healthy that this Parliament is this week urging Texas to reverse the abortion law. It is also healthy not to look the other way when the US administration is considering a migrant center at Guantánamo. Finally, if the United States of Trump as of Biden do not always support European interests, they nevertheless owe respect to their allies. The submarine affair is unacceptable. The chaotic evacuation from Afghanistan is a tragic reminder of this. Let us draw pragmatic lessons so that transatlantic relations are more balanced and let us finally build a united and emancipated European foreign and security policy.'\n",

In Washington , the relationship with the European Union is measured by whether the EU is actively involved in the containment strategy against its main rival , China – especially in the economic sector .

They claim that China has not delivered any opening reforms and are threatening new punitive tariffs to protect American jobs . I think it is good to put the workers at the center of trade policy , but not just your own , please . Because this line of argument applies to all parties involved , including the steel industry in Germany , the EU and beyond , which must necessarily be converted to green energies . We should not think about such cockfights . The global challenges are much more fundamental . There is little time to stop global warming caused by climate change . There are only nine years left to achieve the sustainability goals agreed at the UN for all countries on earth . Poverty reduction , environmental protection , access to health services and education for all , disarmament and peace should be the common goals of our partnership with the USA .

    "raw1_34 = 'Helmut Scholz (The Left). – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen! In Washington, the relationship with the European Union is measured by whether the EU is actively involved in the containment strategy against its main rival, China – especially in the economic sector. Katherine Tai detailed the tactics yesterday. They do not want to terminate the phase 1 trade agreement, but ask China to pay. They claim that China has not delivered any opening reforms and are threatening new punitive tariffs to protect American jobs. I think it is good to put the workers at the center of trade policy, but not just your own, please. Because this line of argument applies to all parties involved, including the steel industry in Germany, the EU and beyond, which must necessarily be converted to green energies. We should not think about such cockfights. The global challenges are much more fundamental. There is little time to stop global warming caused by climate change. There are only nine years left to achieve the sustainability goals agreed at the UN for all countries on earth. Poverty reduction, environmental protection, access to health services and education for all, disarmament and peace should be the common goals of our partnership with the USA. But even the EU and the USA together cannot achieve these goals without gaining additional partners. Cooperation is necessary, also with China. This is where the new narrative begins: instead of confrontation, cooperation, instead of we reestablish synergies and trust together and set rules - also actively in the WTO.'\n",

It is true that the USA is our most important strategic partner . But partnership requires trust . And I think that both we in the European Union and the USA have a role to play here . We have common interests and we should concentrate on these , especially with regard to cooperation in the newly created Technology and Trade Council .

After the election of Joe Biden, there were high expectations that the transatlantic relationship would improve quickly and efficiently. But unfortunately these expectations have not been fulfilled so far: AUKUS, uncoordinated withdrawal from Afghanistan, no progress in reducing tariffs. It is true that the USA is our most important strategic partner. But partnership requires trust. And I think that both we in the European Union and the USA have a role to play here. We have common interests and we should concentrate on these, especially with regard to cooperation in the newly created Technology and Trade Council. For example in semiconductor production: We have gaps in the supply chains. I think it is very, very important to work together here to close the gaps in the supply chain and ramp up production. Example of digitization: creating new rules together - for AI, for the platform economy and the like. And of course our relationship with China: I think we have to work much more closely together strategically there too. Last but not least – Mr Sikorski mentioned it – I think now is the time, the hour, to work on a common European defense union.'\n",

Only a European security and defense policy and greater decision-making capacity in foreign policy will allow us to have effective strategic autonomy and greater effectiveness in action, capable of making us assert ourselves as a partner with influence on a global scale. The stronger and more assertive Europe is, the more relevant it will be to its partners. The diagnosis is made, dear Colleagues. We need decisions.'\n",

Your report and the debate today bear testimony to your continued interest and engagement on the future of the transatlantic relationship. The challenges facing the world at this time are significant. You mentioned a number of them, for instance on China. The EU and US are facing similar challenges related to China’s growing assertiveness. This is why HR/VP Borrell and US State Secretary Blinken launched the EU–US dialogue on China in March this year. On trade and technology. The recent Pittsburgh meeting was an opportunity for a strategic discussion on the future of TTC, defining programmes for 10 working groups and announcing deliverables in five areas: export control, AI, semiconductors, investment screening and global trade challenges. Stability and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic, and beyond, will be enhanced by our ability to work together, which is part of the EU’s strategic autonomy. Having the capacity to act autonomously when and where necessary, and with partners including the US, wherever possible. Therefore, together, we have the opportunity and a responsibility to collaborate on the key challenges of our day.

I have just returned from a fact—finding mission to the United States , where I gathered the last information to prepare a report for the final vote tomorrow .

My main take from today is that the internal cohesion of the European Union is of crucial importance for our position and perception in the multipolar world .
