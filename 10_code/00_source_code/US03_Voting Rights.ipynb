      "Mr. MARKEY . Mr. President , yesterday , the U.S. Senate was once again presented with the opportunity to protect the will and the voices of the American people . We had a chance to protect the sanctity of our electoral processes and to preserve our democracy . We had a chance to extend voting rights . But yesterday , for the second time this year , Republicans unanimously chose obstruction over debate , suppression over representation . All Democrats agree : The Freedom to Vote Act is commonsense legislation . It would enhance access to the ballot for all Americans -- a right enshrined in our Constitution . It would enact badly needed election integrity reforms and eliminate emerging threats to our democracy . The Freedom to Vote Act would put in place key voter protections , such as automatic voter registration , making election day a holiday , and uniform early voting . It includes provisions that are broadly popular with the American people : ending partisan gerrymandering and removing special interest money from our politics . Every single Democrat voted for this bill . Democrats are united behind voting rights . Yesterday , we came to the floor together , ready to start the debate . My Republican colleagues have said that Democrats are attempting to frame voting restrictions as voter suppression , implying that voter suppression is some figment of our imagination , a figment of the imagination of those across the country who are suffering from these practices . Well , to my Republican colleagues , look around . Nineteen States have passed 33 new laws this year that make it harder to vote . We know that these laws disproportionately disenfranchise Black voters , Brown voters , immigrant voters ; voters like a mother in Georgia , who ca n't vote because she ca n't take time off from the job she works to cover the bills in the midst of a pandemic ; or the poll worker in Arizona , who was arrested -- arrested -- for giving a bottle of water to a woman waiting in extreme heat to vote ; or the person in Texas , who could n't vote because he did n't have a ride to the polls . Stories like these are not exaggerations . They are facts , and they are unconscionable facts . If Congress does not step up to the plate on voting rights , then we are signaling to every person in this country that their voice does not matter . We are telling them that we are a country that cares about representation for some but not for all in our country . Ensuring voting rights is how we show , no matter a person 's background or race or hometown or economic status , that their voice can be heard and represented . Not just the wealthy , not just big corporations , not just White Americans -- everybody in our country is fully protected so that they can vote , so they can express that central right in our country . Inaction on voting rights is not an option . Voting rights are the people 's power , and the people 's power is how we unlock opportunity , representation , and justice for everyone in our Nation . Ensuring the right to vote is how we restore faith in our democracy and how we turn popular opinion into legislative action here on the floor of the Senate . This is how we take action to save our planet from the existential threat of the climate crisis that is impacting us right now . This is how we take action to respond to the ongoing COVID- [ [ Page S7139 ] ] 19 pandemic . This is how we take action to address racial injustice across our country . This is how we create the future for our children that we want to see for them . Republican obstruction does not mean this fight is over . Next week , the Senate will prepare for a vote on the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act , and here is how we can get this done : abolish the filibuster . Abolish the filibuster . We must abolish the filibuster so that Democrats who were elected into the majority can begin to operate like a majority . The filibuster is yet another Jim Crow-era relic that silences the voices of disenfranchised people in our country , and this antiquated , parliamentary rule is halting progress in our country . As legislators , our job is to both listen to the people of this country and act on what we have heard from our country . Democrats have listened , and we are working toward action . So , to my Republican colleagues , for the sake of your constituents , I urge you to join us in taking action . If they do not , then , in the face of continued obstruction , we must abolish the filibuster and pass voting rights legislation . The Republicans can no longer be allowed to stand behind the filibuster -- a Jim Crow-era policy , a set of rules that is used on the floor of the Senate to actually deny progress for every single part of our society . The time has passed . These rules are antiquated . They are used in a discriminatory way to deliberately minimize the political power of those who are most vulnerable , and it must end . We must abolish the filibuster . The message we are receiving from the Republican leadership is that they are going to stand fast as a party , and that their political strategy is , in fact , disenfranchisement . It is , in fact , obstructing our ability to hear every single voice in our country . So this is the time . This is the body that must act . We have to change these rules . These rules do not work for everyone . We know that this is our constitutional time . Back when the first Constitution was being drafted , they excluded women , and they excluded the slave population , the Black population , from being able to vote . It was a deliberate plan that had to be rectified . It was rectified by the suffrage movement for women , and it was rectified by the Civil War so that former slaves would be given the right to vote . Well , this is our time . We see this moment for us to act on the filibuster . In the same way that the Civil War was the impediment , it has to be removed because we can see who is harmed if it is not . So I call upon everyone to begin this action to repeal the filibuster to ensure that everyone 's voice is heard in our country . I thank the Presiding Officer for this opportunity . I yield the floor . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The Senator from South Dakota . Filter Bubble Transparency Act and Platform Accountability and Consumer Transparency Act Mr. THUNE . Mr. President , social media has become a big part of a lot of Americans ' lives : TikTok , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube , Instagram . People turn to social media for connection , for entertainment , to stay on top of the news , for pictures of the grandkids , for workout routines , and new recipes . Social media offers a lot of benefits and opportunities , but it is becoming ever more clear that social media has a darker side as well . Social media use can have a negative effect on mental health . It can foster negative and divisive engagement and serve as an outlet for illegal activity , from child pornography to human trafficking . It can have a particularly detrimental effect on the still-developing psyches of teenagers . The Wall Street Journal recently published a series of disturbing reports based on the information of a Facebook whistleblower provided that highlighted everything from the use of Facebook for criminal activity in developing countries to the company 's own research showing the negative impact Instagram can have on teenager girls . Two weeks ago , the Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing where we heard firsthand from the Facebook whistleblower about the concerns that led her to come forward . And next week , the Commerce Committee will be holding a hearing with witnesses from Snapchat , TikTok , and YouTube , examining how these companies treat younger users . A recent Wall Street Journal investigation into TikTok revealed how easy it is for younger users to be bombarded with wildly inappropriate content , from videos promoting drug use to disturbing sexual content . One major problem with social media that came through , once again , in the recent Commerce hearing and in the Wall Street Journal 's recent revelations is social media platforms ' use of algorithms to shape users ' experiences . Gone are the days when you logged into Facebook and just consumed content that had been posted chronologically since your previous login . Now Facebook and other social media platforms use algorithms to shape your news feed and suggestions for additional content , emphasizing posts the platforms think you will be interested in and de-emphasizing other posts . Now , algorithms can be useful , of course . If you are looking for YouTube videos on how to build a bookshelf , you will probably appreciate it if YouTube suggests additional videos on how to build a bookshelf rather than videos on how to roast a turkey or sink the perfect jump shot . But algorithms have a problematic aspect as well . For starters , many people are n't aware just how much their experiences on these platforms are being manipulated and the negative emotional effects that that manipulation can have . Disclosure on these platforms can be confusing or nonexistent , so individuals can be largely unaware that the immense amount of personal data that social media platforms collect is being used to decide what posts they are being shown , what ads they are being offered , and more . Individuals end up being trapped in what has been termed the `` filter bubble '' -- their own world of filtered search results and tailored content . This can lead to everything from political polarization , as users are presented with a narrow , one-sided view of current affairs , to addictive behavior , as the platform doubles down on troubling content that users have shown an interest in . As the Wall Street Journal 's recent articles on Facebook and TikTok demonstrate , the filter bubble can be particularly troubling in the case of younger social media users who may watch an inappropriate video and soon find that their feed is filled with similar material . In many ways , the filter bubble can and does shape a user 's choices and behavior . As the former Commerce Committee chairman and current ranking member of the Commerce Subcommittee on Communications , Media , and Broadband , I have been following these issues for a while and have developed two bipartisan bills -- the Filter Bubble Transparency Act and the PACT Act -- that I think would go a long way toward addressing the problems posed by social media platforms . My Filter Bubble Transparency Act , which is cosponsored by Senators Blumenthal and Blackburn , among others , would allow social media users to opt out of the filter bubble . In other words , it would allow them to opt out of the filtered experience tailored for them by opaque algorithms and , instead , see an unfiltered social media feed or search results that are n't based on the vast amount of information a platform has on them . Facebook , for example , would be required to provide a clear notification to users that their content is being shaped by algorithms . Then Facebook would be required to provide users with an easily accessible option to see a chronological news feed instead of a news feed powered by opaque algorithms that emphasize the posts that Facebook wants you to see . My Platform Accountability and Consumer Transparency Act -- or the PACT Act -- which I introduced with Senator Schatz , would also increase social media transparency . It would require sites to provide an easily digestible disclosure of their content moderation practices for users , and it would address censorship concerns by requiring sites to explain their decisions to remove material to consumers . [ [ Page S7140 ] ] Until relatively recently , sites like Facebook and Twitter would remove a user 's post without explanation and without an appeals process . Even as platforms start to shape up their act with regard to transparency and due process , it is still hard for users to get good information about how content is being moderated . Under the PACT Act , if a site chooses to remove your post , it has to tell you why it decided to remove your post and explain how your post violated the site 's terms of use . Then it has to provide a way for you to appeal that decision . The PACT Act would also explore the viability of a Federal program for Big Tech employees to blow the whistle on wrongdoing inside the companies where they work . We learned a lot from Frances Haugen , the Facebook whistleblower who spoke to the Commerce Committee 2 weeks ago , and I believe that we should encourage employees in the tech sector to speak up about questionable practices of Big Tech companies so that we can , among other things , ensure Americans are fully aware of how social media platforms are making use of artificial intelligence and individuals ' personal data to keep them hooked on their platforms . As I said earlier , social media offers a lot of benefits -- I think we all acknowledge that -- but with the ever-increasing role that it plays in Americans ' lives , it is essential that consumers understand exactly how social media platforms are using their information and shaping the news that they see and the content that they interact with . And I am hopeful that the recent troubling revelations about Facebook and TikTok published by the Wall Street Journal will create an impetus for bipartisan action on social media transparency . I am grateful to have bipartisan cosponsors for both the Filter Bubble Transparency Act and the PACT Act , and I look forward to working with my cosponsors to get these bills passed in the near future . Big Tech has operated in the dark for too long . It is time to shed some light on content moderation . I yield the floor . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The Senator from Texas . "
