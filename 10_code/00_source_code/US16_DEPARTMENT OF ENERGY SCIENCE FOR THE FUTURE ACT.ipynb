      "General Leave Ms. JOHNSON of Texas . Mr. Speaker , I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R . 3593 , the bill now under consideration . The SPEAKER pro tempore . Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Texas ? There was no objection . Ms. JOHNSON of Texas . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . I am very pleased today that we are considering the Department of Energy Science for the Future Act . This well-vetted , bipartisan bill will provide the first ever comprehensive authorization for the Department of Energy 's Office of Science . This office accounts for over half of the Department 's nondefense research and development budget and supports a wide range of research facilities and activities that are critical to the U.S. competitiveness and for enabling our clean energy future . The Office of Science is the Nation 's largest supporter of research in the physical sciences , and it is the lead Federal agency supporting scientific research for energy applications . H.R . 3593 authorizes significant , steady , and sustainable growth for the office 's wide- ranging research from climate science to quantum science , and everything in between . The bill also ensures the office 's construction projects and upgrades to its world-class scientific user facility have the resources they need to be completed on time and on budget . H.R . 3593 is a substantial effort in the fight against climate change . The bill authorizes research to advance the next generation of clean energy technologies to help us reach our shared goals of developing energy that is clean , sustainable , reliable , and affordable . In carrying out these activities , this bill also directs the office to support the development of a skilled , diverse , and inclusive workforce for clean energy researchers , scientists , and professionals . That is why the bill has been endorsed by stakeholders in the business community , like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ; the academic community , like the Association of American Universities ; major scientific associations , like the American Physical and Chemical Societies ; and significant environmental organizations like the Environmental Defense Fund . This bill is another strong example of the collaborative bipartisan approach that our committee has taken . Ranking Member Lucas ' collaborative approach has been crucial in getting us to where we are today . Before I yield back , I would like to recognize the Committee on Science , Space , and Technology staff who worked on this bill , and in some cases for several years now : Adam Rosenberg , Alyse Huffman , Sangina Wright , and Bill Kallen . I also recognize the efforts of Ranking Member Lucas ' staff in helping us to get where we are today , including Hillary O'Brien , Jenn Wickre , and Daniel Dziadon . I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill to dramatically improve the Nation 's competitiveness and help lead us all to a brighter future . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. LUCAS . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . I rise in support of H.R . 3593 , the Department of Energy Science for the Future Act . This legislation , along with H.R . 2225 , the NSF for the Future Act is a comprehensive and strategic approach for investing in American research and development . For decades , America has been the global leader in science and technology development . That success is no accident . It is the result of two things : A cultural commitment to innovation and exploration , and a sustained investment in basic research . This is what makes us uniquely successful . The Federal Government funds high-risk , high-reward basic research that expands our fundamental knowledge of science and technology . This research , which is too costly for the marketplace to fund , produces discoveries that can then be commercialized through private industry . Our system maximizes taxpayer investment and takes advantage of strong public-private partnerships to keep America at the cutting edge of technological progress . Unfortunately , our adversaries in China are investing more than us in R & D in an attempt to take over the lead in science and technology . The way to stay ahead of China is n't adopting their method of a top- down , government-mandated , applied research agenda . It is to reinvest in the basic research , infrastructure , and STEM workers that have always driven American progress . H.R . 3593 does just that . It is the first comprehensive authorization of the Office of Science , which is our Nation 's largest Federal sponsor of basic research in the physical sciences . The DOE Science for the Future Act invests $ 50 billion over 5 years in the Office of Science and the national labs , national scientific user facilities , and the thousands of researchers its supports . The DOE Science for the Future Act is an investment in our technological and clean energy future . It funds research into materials , chemical , biological , and environmental sciences , as well as fusion energy , advanced computing capacities , and cutting edge technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum sciences . We already know that investments in basic research pay large dividends . For example , basic research conducted in our national labs gave us improved hydraulic fracturing technology and allowed us to produce more clean natural gas . This reduced emissions , lowered energy costs for Americans , and helped us become a net total energy exporter for the first time in decades . That is why everyone who cares about clean energy must care about the research supported by H.R . 3593 . Investing in high-risk , early-stage research into cutting edge technologies is the only way to ensure that America stays at the head of the clean energy economy . Another important provision in the DOE Science for the Future Act is the creation of a crosscutting Emerging Infectious Disease Research Initiative to build on DOE 's work to better model , understand , and fight infectious diseases . As they have shown time and again during the COVID-19 pandemic , our national labs have an important role to play in supporting public health . This legislation gives them the resources they need to continue this work . H.R . 3593 also funds much-needed infrastructure updates for our national labs and user facilities . Our ability to conduct world-leading science depends on having access to world-leading equipment and facilities . It also requires having skilled STEM professionals to conduct that research . Our bill includes workforce development and education provisions so that we have a thriving STEM pipeline to fill the technological jobs of the future . Mr. Speaker , H.R . 3593 is a forward-looking bill that is badly needed right now to drive American progress and to keep us globally competitive . As with the NSF for the Future Act , this legislation was drafted with extensive input in a bipartisan fashion , and the result is a strategic and responsible investment in the next generation of breakthrough energy technologies . I thank my friend Chairwoman Johnson for all her work with me on this bill , and I urge my colleagues to pass this now . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Ms. JOHNSON of Texas . Mr. Speaker , I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin ( Ms. Moore ) . Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin . Mr. Speaker , I thank the gentlewoman for yielding . [ [ Page H3219 ] ] I rise today in support of H.R . 3593 , the Department of Energy Science for the Future Act . As a newly minted member of the Science , Space , and Technology Committee , I was so proud to see my colleagues on both sides of the aisle work so hard on this bill to pass it through committee with amendments from both Democrats and Republicans . I , too , had an opportunity as a newly minted member to make an impact on this important legislation . And I think that it was n't by accident , and I thank the chairwoman of the committee , Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson and Representative Lucas , the ranking member , for creating the environment in which we could do our work and craft this important legislation . As you all have heard , the Department of Energy 's Office of Science is a hub of technological advancement and research designed to tackle our greatest scientific challenges facing the United States . Through several hearings in the committee , we learned about the DOE Office of Science 's ongoing efforts to support research and to find solutions . This bill allows the Office of Science to continue carrying out nondefense research on a vast array of critical areas . It supports research to modernize our energy infrastructure , allowing us the tools to overhaul our outdated energy grid to more climate-friendly solutions . And we , of course , have seen some of the catastrophic events caused by the lack of current technologies that recognize the climate action . It funds continuing studies in artificial intelligence and quantum computing , keeping pace with our competitors in the tech sector and readying our cybersecurity defenses from our adversaries , as we have seen up close and personal the cost to our country to not keep abreast of these technologies . During markup , I was able to offer a provision that was included in the bill that is before the House today that would prioritize clean water and watershed research at the Office of Science . My amendment directs the Office of Science to support clean water and watershed research that increases the quality and quantity of water across America , including the treasured Great Lakes . My home district of Milwaukee shares a coast with Lake Michigan , which I consider one of my most important constituents . It is imperative that we study the harmful effects of water pollution , make investments in technologies to combat the contamination of our waterways , and to protect drinking water sources that are critical to every man , woman , and child . We also need to make sure that water continues to be a resource for commerce . My amendment also ensures that relevant communities , research institutions , and nonprofits will be at the table when DOE carries out these tasks . Innovation does n't occur in a vacuum , and it is critical that these research efforts have real world input from key stakeholders . Before I close , I want to mention something about the National Science Foundation , H.R . 2225 , which we considered on this floor today . I thank the chair and the ranking member for leaning in again to put this together in giving Members an opportunity to weigh in . As you all know , the NSF is the funder of more than 1,800 institutions in the United States , and they provide tremendous resources , funding , and opportunities for STEM students . I have been able to weigh in to make sure that there is diversity and opportunity in STEM . I urge my colleagues to support H.R . 3593 , the Department of Energy Science for the Future Act . { time } 1745 Mr. LUCAS . Mr. Speaker , I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Texas ( Mr. Weber ) , the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Energy . Mr. WEBER of Texas . Mr. Speaker , I thank Ranking Member Lucas and the chairwoman of the full committee , Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson . With this bill , the two of them have perfectly demonstrated how a committee can actually function -- even with occasional disagreements -- to prioritize shared goals and produce truly great bipartisan products . They are to be congratulated . Mr. Speaker , I rise today in strong support of H.R . 3593 , the Department of Energy Science for the Future Act . After over a decade of budget requests , hearings , stakeholder input , and information-gathering , I say with a sigh of relief and a great deal of joy that the Committee on Science , Space , and Technology has a bipartisan and comprehensive Office of Science authorization . Although it has taken a little longer than I would have expected , it could n't come at a better time . America 's scientific enterprise has never faced a more serious threat from global competition than it does right now -- today . Innovative science discoveries and advance technology development are n't just aspirations ; they are the actual key to our national security , as well as our economic prosperity . That is because innovation and technology are exactly what the Chinese Communist Party has prioritized in its goal to overtake the United States of America as a global leader in industries of the future . Mr. Speaker , if we want to maintain our key edge in technology areas , like quantum information science and artificial intelligence , and combat the threat of another country controlling the development of those cutting-edge technologies and standards , we must take action now . Mr. Speaker , the solution is really quite simple . We have to invest in American innovation . Just that simple . We must invest in our facilities and our research right here in the United States so that we can ensure the United States remains the global leader in science . How exactly we go about that might be the subject of some debate , but I fully believe that the bill that we have before us today is the best course of action . The Department of Energy 's Office of Science has time and time again demonstrated that basic science research is the most effective way to encourage development of those new technologies . And as the largest Federal sponsor of basic research in the physical sciences , with unparalleled research capabilities and infrastructure , the Office of Science and its national laboratories are uniquely equipped to help America compete . By authorizing cutting-edge research programs with a responsible , scalable funding increase and a strategic roadmap for DOE , federally funded discoveries made through the Office of Science will pave the way for both public and private American innovators to license technologies and to launch those startups . Mr. Speaker , in addition , the Office of Science research in materials and chemical science , biological and environmental research , and fusion energy will not only maintain our lead in science , but will also lay the foundation for the next generation of clean , secure , and exportable energy technologies . Do n't miss that : Clean , exportable , and secure technologies . Maximizing the Office of Science 's role in our Federal research enterprise is how we win . This great legislative body and the Federal Government as a whole can not and will not duplicate a nonmarket economy by forcing mandates and regulations . Instead , we can arm our dynamic private sector with the tools necessary to commercialize sustainable , affordable , and scalable energy solutions . Again , do n't miss that . Through the DOE Science of the Future Act , we are prioritizing critical research areas and investing in the science and technology that will drive development of those technologies into the next generation . This will allow America 's economy to thrive while reducing global emissions and allowing market-based solutions to flourish . Do n't miss that . Robust and consistent support for the Office of Science is crucial to the success and security of the U.S. innovation ecosystem , U.S. energy independence , and U.S. security . Mr. Speaker , this bill does that in a clear , streamlined fashion . It is not bogged down by outside interests or unrelated provisions . We wo n't just keep up with China and other foreign adversaries ; we will outpace them and lead , just like the United States of America has always done . That is a good thing . That is a very good thing , by the way . [ [ Page H3220 ] ] Mr. Speaker , I take a moment to thank the many stakeholders who have worked so hard to get this critical legislation done right . Hats off to all of them . Mr. Speaker , I urge my colleagues to support this bill . It is a great one . It is high time we had this one on the floor . Ms. JOHNSON of Texas . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. LUCAS . Mr. Speaker , I am prepared to close , and I yield myself such time as I may consume . Mr. Speaker , America 's scientific and technological leadership is being threatened by the Chinese Communist Party , and we must act urgently to reinvest in our own research and development enterprise . H.R . 3593 redoubles our commitment to the basic research conducted by the Department of Energy 's Office of Science and our national laboratories . Together with the NSF for the Future Act , it is a comprehensive and sustainable approach to American competitiveness . Mr. Speaker , I thank my staff for everything they have done to help draft this important legislation . I thank my friend , Chairwoman Johnson , and her staff for working with us to include Republican priorities and ensure that this is a truly bipartisan bill . Mr. Speaker , I urge my colleagues to support this legislation , and I yield back the balance of my time . Ms. JOHNSON of Texas . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . Mr. Speaker , in closing , let me simply say that we on this committee know that we are the committee that will determine the future of our Nation and the standing of the world when it comes to science . And we have taken our work very seriously . I am grateful to all of the members . We know we can not be any better than the people who we involve and use their talents , and we must do that as well . Mr. Speaker , I thank all of the members of the committee on both sides of the aisle for staying with us and working through all that we know we need to do to come together to look out for the future of our Nation 's scientific enterprise . Mr. Speaker , I ask all of the persons , my colleagues , to support this bill and vote `` yes . '' Mr. Speaker , I yield back the balance of my time . The SPEAKER pro tempore . The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Texas ( Ms. Johnson ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill , H.R . 3593 , as amended . The question was taken . The SPEAKER pro tempore . In the opinion of the Chair , two-thirds being in the affirmative , the ayes have it . Mr. GRIFFITH . Mr. Speaker , on that I demand the yeas and nays . The SPEAKER pro tempore . Pursuant to section 3 ( s ) of House Resolution 8 , the yeas and nays are ordered . Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX , further proceedings on this motion are postponed . "
