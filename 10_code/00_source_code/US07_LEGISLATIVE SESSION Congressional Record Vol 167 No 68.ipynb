      "COVID-19 HATE CRIMES ACT -- Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER . The Senate will resume legislative session . The Senator from Oklahoma . Defense Budget Mr. INHOFE . Mr. President , last week -- no , it was n't last week ; it was about 3 weeks ago , I guess , now , President Biden released his `` skinny budget , '' which gave us a top-line for defense of $ 715 billion . This is a reduction , and I want to make sure everyone understands this because the cut is actually below inflation , and that is not where we are supposed to be . You know , we have this document here that everyone agrees with . I do n't know one person -- and this was written by six Democrats , six Republicans , and this was in 2018 . This has been used as our blueprint ever since that time , and it is just remarkable the way it has come out . The recommendations on this , as I said , were made by six Republicans , six Democrats . All of them were experts in the field of defense , and they came out with recommendations . In this year , the amount in the budget for our military is supposed to be between 3 and 5 percent . This is in the document in front of us here . Of course , this is actually a reduction . So it is way below what has been prescribed . When it comes to China , there are two big reasons we need to make sure our budget matches our strategy . First of all , China is spending more on their military than ever before . As a result , they are getting more technologically advanced and starting to sway the military balance of power in their favor . There is no question about it , and I will document that in a minute . The threat the Chinese military poses is not a distant threat . It is not something that might happen in 2030 , 2035 , or sometime in the future . It is a problem we face today , right now , and it only gets worse over time . Admiral Davidson told the Armed Services Committee that he expects the threat to manifest `` this decade , in fact , in the next six years . '' That is the sense of urgency . That is when they become greater than we are in many areas of defense and aggression . So today I would like to spend some time dealing with the Chinese military and what they are doing . This is what we are up against . This is why it is so important that we get our defense budget right . Let 's start with China 's military budget . Since 2000 , Beijing 's spending on the People 's Liberation Army has gone up 450 percent -- 450 percent . Now , we knew that back during the Obama administration , that actually went up . Our reduction -- it was a reduction in the last 5 years -- was 25 percent . At the same time , China went up by 83 percent . So this is what is going on in the world today . Beijing 's budget for the military went up 450 percent . Now , you compare Beijing 's buildup with the rest of East Asia . At the same time , our core allies and partners in the region -- that is , Japan , Australia , South Korea , and Taiwan -- have had basically flat defense budgets since 2000 . Compare it with our own military spending . As I mentioned on the floor a couple of weeks ago , at the same time China was adding $ 200 billion to their defense budget , ours shrunk by $ 400 billion . We are certainly not provoking them with defense investment , and we have barely touched our force posture in the Western Pacific over the past two decades . So , if anything , our lack of action , our lack of investment , is what is provoking China into thinking they can push around and threaten our friends in the region . The Biden administration says they want to take our allies and partners seriously . So we should listen when they say they are concerned about Chinese aggression . And they are , and the administration knows this . I have had visits with the President . He is fully aware of that . Another progressive talking point is that the United States spends more on defense than the next 10 or 12 countries combined . Now , that is not true . The reality is that any honest comparison of numbers shows that , combined , the Chinese and Russians almost certainly spend more than us in real terms . China 's purchasing power is significantly greater than ours because they pay their workers next to nothing and have much lower material costs . They also focus their defense spending on hard power . I am talking about airplanes , tanks , ships , missiles , and the like . Why ? Because they do n't take care of their people . People do n't understand this . At least 40 percent of our military budget goes to supporting our people . That is not true with any of the Communist countries that are out there . All they do , they give them the guns and say go out and kill people . We do n't do that . And 40 percent is a conservative figure . You remember the housing issue that was such a big issue ; that you were concerned with ; I was concerned with ; we were all concerned with . That is something that other countries do n't have to worry about . China does n't worry about that . Russia does n't worry about that . These are things that -- and yet that is almost half of our total budget goes to those things for our troops . We take care of our troops . The rest of them do n't . That is the right thing to do . But that is just another reason you ca n't do a dollar-for- dollar comparison between the Chinese and the defense spending . We need a better accounting . And incidentally , Senator Romney introduced an amendment to our last year 's NDAA , military defense act , to get us a real comparison in spending . And the Pentagon owes us that report by October . Now , in October -- we are going to talk about this . We are going to talk about this in our military because this is what the real spending is , not what a lot of people think that it is . All of this is to say , we do n't have a good sense of China 's true defense spending , but we do know it is going up . General McMaster called it `` the largest peacetime military buildup in history . '' That is what General McMaster said just the other day at one of our hearings . It is not just expanding their military ; they are modernizing and professionalizing at the same time . Secretary Austin , our Secretary of Defense , rightfully , calls China our `` pacing threat . '' But here are a few of the ways that they have been outpacing us because they are investing where we are not investing . The American people think we are , but we are not . China has a 355-ship Navy . You know , we have been talking about that for a long period of time here -- how we are going to grow to a 350-ship Navy , and we have n't done it . Well , China has done it . They have achieved that last year . And while we were just talking about it , they were on the attack to get 460 ships by 2030 . By comparison , our Navy is around 300 ships , and it is likely to stay there if our defense budget does n't grow . In the air , the combatant commanders assess that China will have more fifth-generation aircraft than we do in the Pacific by 2025 , again , the fifth-generation aircraft . We are down right now to the F-35 . There are not [ [ Page S2059 ] ] any others . We had the F-22 . The F-22 was our first fifth-generation fighter , and it was one that we were all very excited about . They started out wanting 700 of them , and we ended up with 187 , just for fiscal reasons . Again , that is where China is right now . That gets worse if we have a flat or declining budget here . China is expanding its arsenal too . The Pentagon 's missile experts tell us that China is now over 350 launchers for medium-range ballistic missiles , which are capable of hitting Guam and striking the U.S. warships in the Pacific . They have produced exact copies of our bases , our ships , and our aircraft to serve as targets . And they are out there right now shooting those targets . That is us . That is America , and they are shooting on the replicas of our equipment to show that they can down them . By the way , they hit those targets successfully , I might add . And that is going on today . They also have thousands of short-range missiles . Many of those are going right at Taiwan . China is also dubbing its nuclear stockpile and completing their own nuclear triad . That is something that we have criticism in this country , that we have a triad ; that is , three ways of deflecting nuclear attacks on America . So that is what is going on right now . China 's military is charging ahead in just about every area . But a lot of the people who do n't think China is a problem -- they say that none of the Chinese weapons are as good as ours . Well , that was true in 1990 . That was true in the year 2000 . That is not true anymore . The Office of Naval Intelligence said in 2015 that China 's latest surface warships were comparable in many ways to the mos modern Western ships . China has deployed thousands of ground-base missiles . We are still developing ours . They have fielded hypersonic strike weapons . We are still in the research and development . You might remember , because we saw that , the parade that was taking place in Beijing . They were demonstrating that they have these weapons that we do n't have . And that was invested a year ago . Just last month , the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence assessed that the China rate of investment -- they will soon dominate us in artificial intelligence unless we do something different than we are currently doing . And while the Chinese will spend almost $ 50 billion on tech infrastructure over the next few years , national security infrastructure is apparently the only thing that President Biden does n't consider infrastructure . Not only is China spending more on its military , but it has the tools to beat us . Do n't take my word for it . The bipartisan NDS -- again , this is the document that we have been using , and it has been remarkably accurate , since 2018 . That NDS Commission said , right in this book , the U.S. military might struggle to win or perhaps lose a war against China or Russia . That is what they said in 2018 . And China has been going up ever since . Admiral Davidson told us the other week -- only 2 weeks ago -- that `` there is no guarantee that the United States would win a future conflict with China . '' China 's military buildup is n't just investment for the sake of it ; they are already flexing their new muscle to challenge America and American allies and American interests . And the PLA has deployed missiles , radars , stealth jet fighters , and bombers to islands in the South China Sea , claiming and militarizing islands in violation of international law . Just last year , the PLA fired anti-ship ballistic missiles into the South China Sea , clearly practicing to target U.S. Navy ships in the area . And that is what they are doing today . Those are Chinese troops walking on Woody Island in the South China Sea . And the PLA has been expanding its network of strategic ports and bases around the world from Djibouti to Pakistan and Cambodia and Sri Lanka and elsewhere . Last year , China started going after the territory of India , which has resulted in dozens of dead Indian soldiers . They have continually harassed Japan and Taiwan in the air and on the sea . Their fishing fleets have terrorized small Pacific island nations . Over 200 Chinese boats are staking out a reef in the South China Sea claimed by the Philippines . China has just completed a new satellite constellation over Taiwan that allows for almost constant coverage of the island , the highest known frequency of satellite coverage in the world . A few weeks ago , Taiwan reported the largest ever Chinese incursion when 25 combat aircraft flew into its airspace . And as the cochair of the Taiwan Caucus , this is of specific concern to me . Some people have forgotten that aggression by nation states is not a thing of the past . People have forgotten how costly it is when deterrence fails . That is why I am arguing for sustained real growth in the defense budget . We know it is necessary . We know that it is attainable because the burden of defense spending on the economy today is half what it was at the height of the Cold War . The Biden administration is trying to tell us that we can invest in economic and technological competition or the military competition . That is a false choice . We have to do the military . The reality is , the Chinese are engaged in every dimension of this competition , especially the military dimension , and they are not going to stop anytime soon . I would have to say , do we really want to be there for our allies or partners ? Do we want our children and grandchildren to live in a world where our status of leader of the free world is in name only ? You know , my wife and I have been married for 61 years . We have 20 kids and grandkids so I have a stake in this thing . I have a real concern . Do we want them , these kids , to grow up in a world where China -- the same country that is committing genocide against the Uighurs , silencing free speech , and jailing activists in Hong Kong -- gets to set the rules of international engagement ? This is n't a hypothetical question . That is a question that we are answering each year when we set our military budget , and , frankly , I am disappointed in how the current administration is answering that call . We have to be prepared to take on China from all angles of national power . And this begins with adequate resourcing of our U.S. military with real growth in the defense budget . It is kind of a myth floating around . I know every time I give a speech someplace in the State of Oklahoma or elsewhere , there is a kind of an assumption that we in the United States have the best of everything . And following World War II , that was true , but that is n't true today . And if America chooses to sit on the sidelines in this competition , and we ask our allies and partners to face China alone , the failure of military deterrence becomes more likely . And that is an outcome that nobody there or here wants . With that , I yield the floor . I suggest the absence of a quorum . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The clerk will call the roll . The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll . Mr. DAINES . Mr. President , I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded . The PRESIDING OFFICER . Without objection , it is so ordered . Election Integrity Mr. DAINES . Mr. President , it was n't enough for Democrats like Stacey Abrams and President Biden to lie about the new Georgia voting law . Now , today , Chuck Schumer is sending his lawyers to swarm Montana courtrooms and has taken to the Senate floor with more distortion . This time , it is about Montana 's new voting laws . I have a message for Leader Schumer and the Democrats who are trying to distort the facts and the will of Montana voters : Please get your facts straight . In Montana we are putting in place some commonsense reforms that enjoy the strong support of Montanans . Why is the leader so determined to strike down commonsense efforts to provide integrity and transparency to our elections ? Let 's talk about voter ID . A majority of Americans support needing a photo ID to cast a ballot . According to the Honest Elections Project , 77 percent of Americans support needing a photo ID [ [ Page S2060 ] ] to vote -- 77 percent . Why ? Because it is common sense and because you need a photo ID to do many tasks , some quite mundane . You need a photo ID to get a hunting or fishing license . You need a photo ID to rent a hotel room , to drive a car , to rent a car , to get on an airplane , to pick up tickets at will call . If these simple tasks require a valid ID , should n't protecting the integrity of America 's election process require at least the same ? This is n't the first time Leader Schumer and the Democrats have tried to stick their nose into Montana 's business and tried to overturn the will of Montana voters . In fact , this past election , dark money groups backed by Chuck Schumer pushed to loosen election standards , such as ballot harvesting , in Montana , and they won . This is despite the fact that nearly two-thirds of Montana voters passed a law to prohibit ballot harvesting . How is this listening to Montanans ? It is not . Montanans want election integrity . They want to trust their elections . Yet Leader Schumer continues to undermine their direct appeal to put commonsense practices in place . In Montana we want everyone legally allowed to vote to be able to , and we want there to be zero doubt that those votes should count . All Montanans -- Republicans , Democrats , Independents , Libertarians -- should have faith in our elections . Montana 's legislature , Montana Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen , and Montana Governor Greg Gianforte wanted to strengthen this trust , and that is what they did with these commonsense bills . The distortion by Democrats in this country is eroding this trust . This must stop . I yield the floor . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The Senator from Colorado . Nomination of Vanita Gupta Mr. BENNET . Mr. President , I wanted to come to the floor today to just say a brief word and maybe set the record straight a little bit about President Biden 's nominee for Associate Attorney General of the United States , Vanita Gupta . Let 's start with some facts about Ms. Gupta . She is the daughter of immigrants who worked hard to receive some of the best legal education this country has to offer . She spent 2 decades as a civil rights lawyer , where she has fought to defend Americans ' individual rights and freedoms , often against abuses by the government , something you would think some of my colleagues on the other side would appreciate . When a small town in Texas wrongfully convicted 40 Americans of drug charges , based solely on the false testimony from an undercover police officer , she fought to have them exonerated , and she won them a $ 6 million settlement for that miscarriage of justice . She defended 25 children who had been separated from their parents and thrown into prison-like conditions at a private detention center in Texas . Her success in that case forced the center to improve its conditions and prevented more kids from being held there . President Obama recognized her leadership by making her the top civil rights official at the Department of Justice , where she protected servicemembers from eviction , cracked down on human smugglers and sex traffickers , defended religious freedom , and protected Americans ' fundamental right to vote . Over the past 4 years , Ms. Gupta has led the largest civil rights organization in America , where she has been at the forefront of efforts to reform our criminal justice system , strengthen our democracy , and make sure COVID relief reaches those who need it most . That is her record . It is an outstanding record . I think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know that it is an outstanding record because they do n't want to contend with her record . They do n't want to contest her record . They ca n't defeat her nomination with the truth . So they are just using talking points that are n't true . I heard the junior Senator from Texas say Ms. Gupta 's record `` is that of an extreme partisan ideologue . '' He called her `` an extreme political activist , '' a `` radical , '' and a `` zealot , '' when all she has done her entire career is uphold the rule of law and defend our democracy , just like the 60 judges , many of them confirmed by Republican colleagues , who rejected President Trump 's utterly unsubstantiated claims of fraud in the 2020 election ; just like the election officials who stood up to conspiracy theories about the election at great risk to themselves and to their careers , who were all undermined by radical Members of Congress who sought to overturn the will of the voters for their own power . I also heard the junior Senator from Texas say Ms. Gupta 's beliefs `` do n't align with the majority of the American people . '' I am willing to bet every single dollar in my pocket that most Americans are quite aligned with Ms. Gupta 's views . Most Americans are very interested in having a Department of Justice that protects their right to vote , that keeps families together and kids out of prison-like conditions , to make sure that LGBT sons and daughters and neighbors can live free from discrimination . I will tell you one other thing . Unlike some people around this place , Ms. Gupta actually has a record of reaching across the aisle to get things done . She worked with Grover Norquist and the top lawyer for the Koch brothers to pass criminal justice reform . It is why they both endorsed her , along with President Bush 's former Secretary of Homeland Security , and virtually every major law enforcement organization in America , including the Fraternal Order of Police , the National Sheriffs ' Association , the Major County Sheriffs of America , and the Major Cities Chiefs Association . So it is hard to take seriously all this talk on the other side about how Ms. Gupta wants to `` defund the police . '' She has never supported that . When someone asked the head of the Fraternal Order of Police what he thought about these attacks , he called it `` partisan demagoguery . '' And that is exactly what it is , and he is right . There is n't a serious debate about her record . It is a political campaign to defeat her nomination . The American people see through it , and I hope my colleagues will see through it as well . We would be lucky to have someone with Ms. Gupta 's experience and leadership at the Department of Justice . Many years ago , I had the privilege to work at the Department , and I know how seriously the men and women there take their jobs , and I know how grateful they would be to serve alongside someone as talented and committed to the mission as Ms. Gupta . It is why I believe tomorrow we should come to this floor and give her a resounding bipartisan vote to confirm her as the next Associate Attorney General of the United States . I urge all of my colleagues to put aside the rhetoric and the false claims . Look at the record for what it is . The police organizations have supported her . And vote yes for her nomination . I yield the floor . I suggest the absence of a quorum . The PRESIDING OFFICER ( Ms. Hassan ) . The clerk will call the roll . The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll . Mr. SCHUMER . Madam President , I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded . The PRESIDING OFFICER . Without objection , it is so ordered . Cloture Motion Mr. SCHUMER . Madam President , I send a cloture motion to the desk . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The cloture motion having been presented under rule XXII , the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion . The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows Cloture Motion We , the undersigned Senators , in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate , do hereby move to bring to a close debate on amendment No . 1445 to S. 937 , a bill to facilitate the expedited review of COVID-19 hate crimes , and for other purposes .
