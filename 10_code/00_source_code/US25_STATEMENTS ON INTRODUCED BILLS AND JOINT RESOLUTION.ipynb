      "Mr. PADILLA ( for himself , Ms. Warren , Mrs. Feinstein , and Mr. Markey ) : S. 2004 . A bill to provide for the basic needs of students at institutions of higher education ; to the Committee on Health , Education , Labor , and Pensions Mrs. FEINSTEIN . Mrs. President , I rise to speak in support of the `` BASIC Act , '' which I introduced today . I know how important it is to help students cover the full cost of attending college , including tuition and fees , housing , food , transportation , books , medical , childcare and supplies . In California , even though State and institutional aid programs cover full tuition and fees for about half of students attending a California State University , University of California and California Community College , students struggle to pay for the remaining cost of attendance . Each year , over 300,000 eligible applicants do not receive a state Cal Grant because of limited availability . Non-tuition college costs can exceed $ 20K annually . Low-income students may spend about half their family income on out-of-pocket costs after grant aid . This bill will help accelerate California 's work to make college affordable and provide funding to reach more schools across California and across our Nation . This is especially important at a time when community college enrollment has slowed during the COVID-19 pandemic , particularly among students of color , lower-income students , and students who have left to work or take care of family members . As we work to build back better and increase affordability and accessibility [ [ Page S4046 ] ] of higher education , we must help our students stay in school . That is why I am proud to introduce this bill to authorize $ 1 billion for a new grant program to help institutions of higher education meet students ' basic needs . This funding represents an essential aspect of building more equitable paths to higher education , and it represents an investment in our students , our institutions , and our future . This legislation recognizes the disproportionate impact this pandemic has on vulnerable populations and it helps coordinate assistance across federal agency lines . I want to thank Senator Warren and Representative Torres for introducing this bill with me , and I hope our colleagues will join us in support of this bill that ensures no student is forced to choose between their education and food or housing . Thank you , Mr. President . I yield the floor . ______ By Mr. REED ( for himself , Ms. Collins , Mr. Van Hollen , Ms. Cortez Masto , and Ms. Klobuchar ) : S. 2008 . A bill to strengthen the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness ; to the Committee on Banking , Housing , and Urban Affairs . Mr. REED , Mr. President , along with Senator Collins , I am reintroducing legislation that would eliminate the sunset date for the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness ( the Council or USICH ) so that this agency can build upon its success in helping to prevent and end homelessness nationally . The Council was established under the Reagan Administration as part of the landmark Mckinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987 , Since that time , it has worked across the Federal government and the private sector to coordinate homeless assistance nationally . In 2009 , e Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act , which I authored along with Senator Collins , expanded the Council 's role to work with public , non-profit , and private stakeholders to develop a national strategic plan to end homelessness . According to the Council , the Council 's work `` has helped drive homelessness down by 9 % and helped 82 communities effectively end veteran homelessness and four end chronic homelessness '' since 2010 . Even with this progress , the Department of Housing and Urban Development 's 2020 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress found that on `` a single night in 2020 , roughly 580,000 people were experiencing homelessness in the United States '' and `` 2020 mark ] ed ] the first time since data collection began that more individuals experiencing homelessness were unsheltered than were sheltered . '' Clearly , we have more work to do . and if anything , COVID-19 has further highlighted the critical importance of housing . Indeed , for many families , their homes may be the single most effective and accessible form of personal protective equipment . And we also know that continuing to invest in programs to address homelessness and increase affordable housing pays additional dividends . According to Crossroads Rhode Island , a homeless services organization , `` In 2016 , approximately 90 % of individuals experiencing homelessness in Rhode Island were on Medicaid , '' and `` The average annual Medicaid cost for a person experiencing homelessness in Rhode Island ( $ 14,723 ) was 80 % higher than that of the average Medicaid recipient ( $ 8,200 ) . '' In short , helping families avoid homelessness can actually save taxpayers money . This is what we call a win-win , and the Council is uniquely positioned to facilitate a whole of government approach that marshals the resources of the Council 's 19 federal member agencies to help more communities effectively address homelessness and also potentially save taxpayer funds . Our bipartisan legislation ensures that the Council 's doors remain open until there truly is an end to homelessness nationwide . I thank the many groups that support our legislation including the National Low Income Housing Coalition , Local Initiatives Support Corporation , the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities , HousingWorksRI , and others . I urge our colleagues to join Senator Collins and me in supporting this legislation . ______ By Mr. REED ( for himself and Mr. Grassley ) : S. 2009 . A bill to promote transparency by permitting the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to allow its disciplinary proceedings to be open to the public , and for other purposes ; to the Committee on Banking , Housing , and Urban Affairs . Mr. REED . Mr. President . the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ( PCAOB ) Enforcement Transparency Act , which I reintroduce today with Senator Grassley , will bring needed transparency to the disciplinary proceedings the PCAOB has brought against auditors and audit firms earlier in the process . Nearly two decades ago , in response to a series of massive financial reporting frauds , including those involving Enron and WorldCom . the Senate Banking Committee held multiple hearings , which produced consensus on various underlying causes , including weak corporate governance , a lack of accountability , and inadequate oversight of accountants charged with auditing public companies ' financial statements . Later , in a 99 to 0 vote , the Senate passed the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002 to address the structural weaknesses revealed by the hearings . Among its many provisions , this law called for the creation of an independent board , the PCAOB , responsible for overseeing auditors of public companies in order to protect investors who rely on independent audit reports on the financial statements of public companies . Today , the PCAOB , under the oversight of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , oversees more than 1,700 registered accounting firms , as well as the audit partners and staff who contribute to a firm 's work on each audit . The Board 's ability to begin proceedings that can determine whether there have been violations of its auditing standards or rules of professional practice is a crucial component of its oversight . However , unlike other oversight bodies , the Board 's disciplinary proceedings can not be made public without consent from the parties involved . Of course , parties subject to disciplinary proceedings have no incentive to consent to publicizing their alleged wrongdoing and these proceedings typically remain cloaked behind a veil of secrecy . In addition , the Board can not publicize the results of its disciplinary proceedings until after the appeals process has been completely exhausted , which can often take several years . This lack of transparency invites abuse and undermines the Congressional intent behind the PCAOB , which was to shine a bright light on auditing firms and practices , deter misconduct and bolster the accountability of auditors of public companies to the investing public . Our bill will restore transparency by making hearings by the PCAOB , and all related notices , orders , and motions , transparent and available to the public unless otherwise ordered by the Board . This would more closely align the PCAOB 's procedures with those of the SEC for analogous matters . Increasing transparency and accountability of audit firms subject to PCAOB disciplinary proceedings bolsters investor confidence in our financial markets and better protects companies from problematic auditors . I hope our colleagues will join Senator Grassley and me in supporting this legislation to enhance transparency in the PCAOB 's enforcement process . ______ By Ms. COLLINS ( for herself , Mr. Kelly , and Mr. Menendez ) : S. 2022 . A bill to enable States to better provide access to whole genome sequencing clinical services for certain undiagnosed children under the Medicaid program , and for other purposes ; to the Committee on Finance . Ms. COLLINS . Mr. President , I rise today to introduce the `` Ending the Diagnostic Odyssey Act . '' This legislation gives States the option of providing whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) clinical services through edicaid for children with a disease that is suspected to have a genetic cause , at an enhanced Federal matching rate for three years . I am pleased to be joined by Senators Kelly and Menendez . Children with rare diseases will spend on average five to seven years on a diagnostic odyssey , and 30 percent of [ [ Page S4047 ] ] those children will not survive beyond the age of five years old . The average patient sees seven different physicians in that time . The wait to find a cause -- never mind a cure -- can be excruciating . Parents try to project a calm and reassuring presence for their child while facing a whirlwind of doctor appointments , hospital visits , and unanswered questions . Undeniably , we are making progress in both accelerating research funding for rare diseases as well as in the development of diagnostics . In 2014 , the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) launched a program called the Undiagnosed Disease Network ( UDN ) . In its first 20 months , the UDN accepted 601 participants undiagnosed by traditional medical practices . Of those who completed their UDN evaluation during this time , 35 % were given a diagnosis . Many of these diagnoses were rare genetic diseases including 31 previously unknown syndromes . In May 2019 , the Director of the National Institutes of Health , Dr. Francis Collins , wrote a blog post on how whole genome sequencing -- combined with artificial intelligence ( AI ) -- can now be used to diagnose genetic diseases in seriously ill babies in fewer than 24 hours . Dr. Collins writes `` I would submit that there is no other technology in the history of planet Earth that has experienced this degree of progress in speed and affordability . '' For parents of children with an undiagnosed illness , answers can not come soon enough . There are approximately 7,000 rare diseases known today . Approximately 80 percent of rare diseases are genetic , and about one-half of all rare diseases affect children . For example , Alstrom syndrome is an extremely rare and complex genetic disorder . Approximately 1200 affected individuals have been identified worldwide , which makes a obtaining a correct diagnosis challenging . Characteristics of Alstrom syndrome include vision disturbances , sensorineural hearing impairment , cardiomyopathy , obesity , kidney dysfunction , and diabetes . Robin Marshall , Executive Director of the Alstrom Syndrome International , located in Mount Desert Island , Maine , has said that `` Whole Genome Sequencing has changed the lives of those we represent by enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis , fostering more timely and appropriate medical care , and unlocking a host of social services to combat the educational and psycho-social complications that our children confront . '' By giving states an incentive to provide whole genome sequencing for eligible children through Medicaid , my legislation will ensure that more children and their families can obtain the right diagnosis and treatment from the start . The `` Ending the Diagnostic Odyssey Act '' has the support of more than one hundred patient advocacy organizations , including Alstrom Syndrome International , the Genetic Alliance , the Personalized Medicine Coalition , and many others . I urge my colleagues to support this legislation . ______ By Mr. THUNE ( for himself , Mr. Blumenthal , Mr. Moran , Mrs. Blackburn , Mr. Warner , and Mr. Schatz ) : S. 2024 . A bill to require that internet platforms give users the option to engage with a platform without being manipulated by algorithms driven by user-specific data ; to the Committee on Commerce , Science , and Transportation . Mr. THUNE . Mr. President , I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record . "
