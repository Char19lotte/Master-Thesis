We ’ ve had strong cooperation , resulting in a balanced report that clearly identifies areas we believe can and should be acted on to improve the functioning of our single market in the digital area . The last 12 months and more have demonstrated to us the value of digitalisation and how it can contribute to bringing people together , to connecting businesses to consumers and connecting business to business . But we can do more to make our single market work better for citizens and businesses , make European SMEs , micro-businesses and larger companies more competitive , and improve their potential to compete globally . As always , we need to remove unnecessary and unjustified barriers that occur at national level and emphasise the need for a strong European approach that gives certainty to enterprise . European companies should engage with an EU approach to regulation and not have to engage with 27 Member State approaches . This certainty will encourage entrepreneurs and others who want to expand and establish themselves in the European Union , as they will know that the EU is a place where they can do this . They know for sure what ’ s expected of them . There will be no barriers , no borders , just a market of 450 million citizens and the support of European regulation that provides legal clarity . European regulation that is trustworthy , fully compliant with fundamental rights , consumer protection rules , data protection rules and is non-discriminatory . These are the traits Europe has established for itself and as a leader worldwide , and the traits we also want to embed in our digital rules . Of course , this approach is always essential for our public services that support our citizens , regardless of where they reside . As we continue to deal with COVID and the fallout from the pandemic , as we face our ambition of implementing the EU Green Deal , and as we reorganise our healthcare services , digitalisation and emerging technologies such as AI can and will contribute to reaching these objectives . It is really encouraging to see that 25 % of the EU rescue fund is going to be earmarked for digital and we must not waiver from that . Funding for SMEs , innovation and tech entrepreneurs is vital if we are to facilitate the development of the EU tech space that we so badly need . If we look at our global competitors in the AI sector , like the United States or China , we can see that more private sector investment is encouraged there than it is here in the European Union . Yes , we have our InvestEU , our Horizon EU and other programmes , and these are enormously successful , but we must also introduce policies that leverage private sector investment in terms of venture capital or seed capital . We need that private sector investment to ensure that we don ’ t have scale-ups for sale here in Europe , and we don ’ t have start-ups that will scale up in third countries . We want EU successes . I really welcome the Commissioner ’ s recent proposals to support artificial intelligence through regulation , proposals designed to encourage its use and , importantly , to encourage consumer confidence . AI has enormous potential to address many of the challenges that we face today in the healthcare sector , agriculture and transport , and in developing our smart cities . The list is endless and it does go on , but AI is not without its drawbacks or its risks , such as lack of transparency or traceability , or lack of human oversight , bias decision-making , etc .

We need to inform consumers on the use of artificial intelligence , where it is being used and when they are engaging with it . Consumers have a right to be adequately informed in a timely and easily accessible manner where AI exists and the possible outcomes , how the system is established , is checked , how it can be contested and how it can be corrected . This is a very important position that we have reflected in our report today , because we believe that these criteria are essential if we want to encourage consumer confidence , and they will in turn feed into an ecosystem that allows AI products and technologies to develop . There are risks with artificial intelligence ; I don ’ t deny that . In some areas of operation , the risks will be higher than in others .

      "Margaritis Schinas , Vice-President of the Commission . – Mr President , Madam Rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank you for this impressive work and for this timely report . The pandemic has only confirmed the importance of working on digital priority , including artificial intelligence ; but the pandemic is not over and I am confident that the momentum towards digitization will continue . Europe is in a unique position to develop and use advanced digital technologies , such as artificial intelligence , big data and the Internet of Things , in an ambitious , innovative and sustainable way . The widespread integration of these digital technologies is essential for European economic recovery . Our duty as European policymakers is to facilitate and help accelerate this process . This means removing barriers to the digital single market , empowering people to use a new generation of technologies to serve them , and addressing strategic weaknesses in our digital infrastructures . We in the Commission are determined to make the 2020s digital decade of Europe . We want to drive digital policies that empower people and businesses and lead to a sustainable and prosperous digital future . This European digital decade must be based on four cardinal points : talent , infrastructure , business transformation and the digitization of public administrations . For each of these four areas , we also propose clear quantified objectives to be achieved by 2030 , as well as concrete actions , including for SMEs and start-ups . After listening to stakeholders , the Commission will propose a digital policy program and a solemn declaration of digital principles . We are of course counting on the support and commitment of this house to achieve this ambition . To foster digital transformation , the Commission has already proposed important legislative initiatives which are on your table , such as the digital services legislation , the digital market legislation , a new European cybersecurity strategy and the act on data governance . She also noted that artificial intelligence can strategically and crucially contribute to these goals . The key to unlocking the benefits of all this data will be processing it through artificial intelligence systems that we will be proposing in a new legislative initiative , the Data Act , later this year . Here again , I observe that we essentially share the same concerns . Your report also underlines that we must find a way to protect European values , security , fundamental rights and our European way of life , but without jeopardizing our potential for innovation . You also stress on several occasions the importance of taking into account the needs of SMEs . The deployment of AI by large companies alone would effectively deprive us in Europe of most of the advantages linked to these technologies . The artificial intelligence package that we just proposed on April 21 reflects exactly this dual approach , which consists of developing the potential of artificial intelligence while tackling the problems that these technologies can cause . The proposed AI regulation is built so that all Europeans can have confidence in the anthropocentric management of artificial intelligence . Proportional and flexible rules are proposed to address the specific risks posed by AI systems in certain contexts . We also foresee a technologically neutral and evolutionary definition of the notion of AI , insofar as it can also cover techniques and approaches that are not yet known or developed . It also prohibits the use of particularly risky artificial intelligence technologies , such as social rating . For the rest , it is based on a risk-related approach , since it focuses on so-called high-risk AI use cases . Only these cases must meet a set of requirements specifically designed to enhance transparency and minimize risks to security and our fundamental rights . The coordinated plan published together with the proposal for a regulation describes the policies and investments needed at European level to establish European pre-eminence in this area . We aim to encourage investment from Member States and stimulate private investment , to gradually increase all public and private investment in the field of artificial intelligence to 20 billion euros per year from here at the end of the decade . The Commission will invest around EUR 1 billion per year in this area , in the context of the Horizon Europe and Digital Europe programs for the budgetary period of the next seven years , but without counting the investments on the cohesion policy program , which will be added to this sum . These investments aim to support research , innovation , testing , experimentation , skills development and the use of AI for SMEs . Europe has research excellence , a vibrant robotics community and successful industrial sectors . Together , they contribute to European excellence in artificial intelligence and help us to take advantage of the advantages these technologies offer us . Finally , we have included measures on artificial intelligence in the field of health and on the development of green intelligence . Ladies and gentlemen , allow me to conclude by emphasizing the constructive role that this Parliament has played , and will continue to play , in advancing this ambitious European programme . Allow me also to conclude by thanking you once again for your impressive work and by further emphasizing how convergent and compatible our approaches are . "

The widespread integration of these digital technologies is essential for European economic recovery. Our duty as European policymakers is to facilitate and help accelerate this process. This means removing barriers to the digital single market, empowering people to use a new generation of technologies to serve them, and addressing strategic weaknesses in our digital infrastructures. We in the Commission are determined to make the 2020s digital decade of Europe. We want to drive digital policies that empower people and businesses and lead to a sustainable and prosperous digital future. This European digital decade must be based on four cardinal points: talent, infrastructure, business transformation and the digitization of public administrations. For each of these four areas, we also propose clear quantified objectives to be achieved by 2030, as well as concrete actions, including for SMEs and start-ups. After listening to stakeholders, the Commission will propose a digital policy program and a solemn declaration of digital principles. We are of course counting on the support and commitment of this house to achieve this ambition. To foster digital transformation, the Commission has already proposed important legislative initiatives which are on your table, such as the digital services legislation, the digital market legislation, a new European cybersecurity strategy and the act on data governance. She also noted that artificial intelligence can strategically and crucially contribute to these goals. The key to unlocking the benefits of all this data will be processing it through artificial intelligence systems that we will be proposing in a new legislative initiative, the Data Act, later this year. Here again, I observe that we essentially share the same concerns. Your report also underlines that we must find a way to protect European values, security, fundamental rights and our European way of life, but without jeopardizing our potential for innovation. You also stress on several occasions the importance of taking into account the needs of SMEs. The deployment of AI by large companies alone would effectively deprive us in Europe of most of the advantages linked to these technologies. The artificial intelligence package that we just proposed on April 21 reflects exactly this dual approach, which consists of developing the potential of artificial intelligence while tackling the problems that these technologies can cause. The proposed AI regulation is built so that all Europeans can have confidence in the anthropocentric management of artificial intelligence. Proportional and flexible rules are proposed to address the specific risks posed by AI systems in certain contexts. We also foresee a technologically neutral and evolutionary definition of the notion of AI, insofar as it can also cover techniques and approaches that are not yet known or developed. It also prohibits the use of particularly risky artificial intelligence technologies, such as social rating. For the rest, it is based on a risk-related approach, since it focuses on so-called high-risk AI use cases. Only these cases must meet a set of requirements specifically designed to enhance transparency and minimize risks to security and our fundamental rights. The coordinated plan published together with the proposal for a regulation describes the policies and investments needed at European level to establish European pre-eminence in this area. We aim to encourage investment from Member States and stimulate private investment, to gradually increase all public and private investment in the field of artificial intelligence to 20 billion euros per year from here at the end of the decade. The Commission will invest around EUR 1 billion per year in this area, in the context of the Horizon Europe and Digital Europe programs for the budgetary period of the next seven years, but without counting the investments on the cohesion policy program , which will be added to this sum. These investments aim to support research, innovation, testing, experimentation, skills development and the use of AI for SMEs. Europe has research excellence, a vibrant robotics community and successful industrial sectors. Together, they contribute to European excellence in artificial intelligence and help us to take advantage of the advantages these technologies offer us. Finally, we have included measures on artificial intelligence in the field of health and on the development of green intelligence. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to conclude by emphasizing the constructive role that this Parliament has played, and will continue to play, in advancing this ambitious European programme. Allow me also to conclude by thanking you once again for your impressive work and by further emphasizing how convergent and compatible our approaches are.'\n",

I hope he has your support.'\n",

We now have a proposal on the table, the first of its kind in the world, and I thank and congratulate the Commission for it. We now need to work to ensure its success, and our mission is this: we need to secure the rights of all citizens and ensure AI does not lead to biases and discrimination. AI should be a force for good. We need to remove regulatory burdens to support innovation in our companies, big and small. AI should be a tool for prosperity and global competitiveness. We need to educate our citizens and train our specialists on AI. AI is as much about today as it is about the future. We need to ensure that Member States will implement this AI regulation in a manner that strengthens the digital single market and doesn’t fragment it. AI should bring the Union closer together. And we need to work with the US and other democracies to ensure AI is developed according to democratic values worldwide. AI is a geopolitical subject and the EU is a geopolitical actor. We have a historic opportunity to show global leadership. Let’s use it wisely.'\n",

Technological innovation has changed our life and the future holds still other innovations: certainly artificial intelligence constitutes the new frontier of this technological progress and, if regularized and used appropriately, it will guarantee the development of all areas of our economy, including agriculture in which there is a lot of interest on the part of young people and in difficult areas, where thanks to intelligence it will be possible to produce better and more easily. Indeed, in the Commission White Paper on agriculture and in the new Common Agricultural Policy, artificial intelligence is an essential component for the future of the sector. The new technologies developed by artificial intelligence will also be fundamental for achieving the objectives of the \"From producer to consumer\" and biodiversity strategies, in the interest of producers and consumers, promoting better production quality, optimizing natural resources, guaranteeing animal welfare, reducing pesticides and fertilizers, improving the traceability of products. The single market has always been a founding element of the Union and in this way, with artificial intelligence, it will be able to further strengthen the integration process and determine favorable conditions for development and the economy.'\n",
