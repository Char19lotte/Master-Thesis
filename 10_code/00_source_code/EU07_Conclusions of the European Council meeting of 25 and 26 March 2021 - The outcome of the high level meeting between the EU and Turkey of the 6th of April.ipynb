      "Charles Michel , European Council . – Mr President , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen European parliamentarians , first of all , I would like to thank you for this invitation which has been extended to us to present the debriefing both of the visit to Turkey and of the European Council . As you know , I have always had , and I take to heart , this strengthening of the links between the different institutions – the European Council and the European Parliament – ​​through regular debriefings by the European Council . I will first talk about Turkey and our joint visit to Ankara , before addressing the other items on the agenda of the March European Council . As regards relations with Turkey , they have been , as you know , difficult for many years . We have discussed Turkey at European Council meetings on eleven occasions since I took office as President of the European Council , which shows the serious and delicate nature of this relationship . In March , we adopted a clear , solid declaration , the expression of a possible positive agenda , but which would be progressive , proportionate and reversible , with a date clause for the European Council in June . This statement paved the way for this visit to Ankara . With regard to this protocol incident , I have on several occasions publicly expressed my regret for the situation that has been created – regret vis-à-vis the President of the Commission and vis-à-vis all those who felt offended . The hard facts are known . The Council protocol team did not have access to the meeting room before the start of the meeting and the Commission did not send its protocol team in advance . The teams therefore did not have access to the seating arrangement before the start of the meeting . We are committed , Ursula von der Leyen and myself , to ensure that this situation can not happen again in the future . We have given instructions to this effect to our protocol and diplomatic teams . I know that these circumstances have led many of you to consider that , at the time , I should have acted differently . It is a criticism that I hear , of course , but at that moment and without the hindsight that we all have today , I decided not to react further so as not to create a political incident that I I thought even more serious , which would have run the risk of ruining months of political and diplomatic preparation and the efforts of all the teams at the European level . I naturally measure that the images may have made many women feel offended and I would like to reaffirm my total , complete , absolute commitment to supporting women and supporting gender equality . This is a question that I have been able to address regularly in the context of my political career . During our discussions with President Erdoğan , President Ursula von der Leyen and I had the opportunity to express forcefully , firmly , our positions regarding the withdrawal of Turkey from the Istanbul Convention . In recent days , many of you have written or contacted me to suggest that I use this incident to defend even more strongly the role and rights of women , and I want to take this outstretched hand . I want to take advantage of this momentum to try to move forward constructively . For example , to be concrete , you can count on my commitment and my best efforts to try to mobilize the Member States and try to unblock this proposal for a directive on a better balance between men and women among the non-executive directors of listed companies . I am also ready , of course , to engage on other priorities with you , such as the crucial issue of equal pay . The gender pay gap in the EU is over 14 % ; it has changed very little over the past decade , and this situation is simply not acceptable . Likewise , I am willing to consider the proposal for a possible Council formation on gender equality . Ladies and gentlemen , let me now turn to the substance of the Ankara meeting . The objective of the meeting was to try to lead Turkey towards a more constructive - or at least a less negative - path with the European Union , to try to defuse tensions and to place a clear emphasis on the rule of law , democratic values ​​and human rights . President von der Leyen and I had the opportunity to tell President Erdoğan that we are ready to put on the table a positive but conditional , proportional and reversible agenda . This presupposes progress in several areas , in particular , of course , human rights , but also relations with Greece or even the Cyprus question . We have expressed our deep concerns about the rule of law , fundamental rights , the withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention , but also freedom of expression , and the targeting of political parties and the media . Extensive cooperation with Turkey is difficult to envisage if negative measures were to continue in these areas . Exploratory talks between Greece and Turkey have started . Discussions on the settlement of the Cyprus issue are also due to start this week under the auspices of the United Nations and we have called on Turkey to engage constructively . We also underlined the importance of the role of the Union as an active observer in this process within the United Nations . We have also identified the possible pillars for this agenda : first , economic cooperation and the possible modernization of the customs union ; secondly , the question of migration , the need to be engaged and in good faith on this subject , but also the question of interpersonal contacts and mobility . The question of the Turkish regional role was of course addressed , as were foreign affairs and geopolitical issues – for example , the situation in Libya , Syria or even Nagorno-Karabakh . We were able to raise this issue of the memorandum of understanding signed between Turkey and Libya on maritime delimitation and recall the clear position of the European Council on this subject . I would like to point out that before this mission in Turkey , I had the opportunity to go to Libya and Tunisia the previous two days . It is decided at the European Council that in the month of June , the Heads of State and Government will look again at this relationship between the European Union and Turkey in order to consider what follow-up - on the basis , we hopefully , progress that can be made – we will give to this relationship between the European Union and Turkey . As you know , we addressed COVID—19 as a matter of priority during our discussions . We focused on three crucial areas . First , getting our citizens vaccinated as quickly as possible . Some countries raised concerns on vaccine distribution and the imbalances between them . We reaffirmed the principle of sharing vaccines on a pro rata population basis . The question of the governance of the steering board was also raised by leaders . We tasked the COREPER to address this issue in a spirit of solidarity and I am glad that a solution was found the week after the European Council . Second , we discussed preparations for the lifting of restrictions and interoperable digital certificates . You will be discussing digital certificates on Wednesday . I hope trilogues will start as soon as possible . Third , the international dimension . The EU is a major exporter of vaccines around the globe . At the same time , we decided that we would continue to strengthen our response to the pandemic through a vaccine—sharing mechanism in addition to COVAX . During our meeting , we also had a short information point on Russia . I reported on my visits to Georgia , Moldova and Ukraine . We reaffirmed our five guiding principles towards Russia and agreed to return to the matter at the next European Council meeting . We adopted strong conclusions on digital , the single market and industrial policy and the economy . On digital taxation , we would prefer a global solution in the framework of the OECD but , if necessary , we are ready to move forward on our own . At our euro summit we adopted a framework to continue our common work on the international role of the euro . We will deepen our work around four main pillars : a strong economic base , a sound financial architecture , the digital finance and the green finance . A strong euro will enhance our strategic autonomy , while preserving an open economy . Finally , we welcomed President Joe Biden during our session . It was the first time in over ten years that we have welcomed the President of the United States and we agreed that we must join forces to defeat COVID—19 and work closely together on vaccines and on supply chains . On climate , we welcomed America ’ s return to the Paris Agreement . We discussed safeguarding our common values in the digital world and we acknowledged our wish to address geopolitical challenges together . We want to build on our friendship and forge a new transatlantic mind-set , a robust foundation for our renewed cooperation . As you know , together with President Biden and President von der Leyen , we will have an EU—US summit in mid—June . I believe the European Union must realise the level of its ambition and of its achievements , especially on the international scene . We are not as weak as we think or as we say . Look at our influence around the world . Look at Georgia , Ukraine or Africa . Look at how we have influenced other strong nations to be more ambitious on climate . China , Brazil , India and the United States are following the European Union ’ s example . Three years ago in Sibiu , only seven Prime Ministers asked for climate neutrality by 2050 and now carbon pricing has become a topical debate well beyond the European Union ’ s borders . Look at how we have set global standards for digital . The GDPR is now the global gold standard for privacy . The US is following our example and is ready to work on a digital tax . Just last week , the EU was the first in the world to propose binding legislation on artificial intelligence . We are leading by example . The EU is sitting in the driving seat for renewed multilateralism and for pursuing its strategic autonomy , and we can do so much more . "

      "Ursula von der Leyen , President of the Commission . – President Sassoli , President Michel , honourable Members , I am the first woman to be President of the European Commission . I am the President of the European Commission , and this is how I expected to be treated when visiting Turkey two weeks ago – like a Commission President . But I was not . I can not find any justification for how I was treated in the European Treaties . So I have to conclude that it happened because I am a woman . Would this have happened if I had worn a suit and a tie ? In the pictures of previous meetings , I did not see any shortage of chairs . But then again , I did not see any women in these pictures either . Many of you will have had quite similar experiences in the past . Especially the female Members of this House . I ’ m sure you know exactly how I felt . I felt hurt and I felt alone as a woman and as a European . Because it is not about seating arrangements or protocol . This goes to the core of who we are , this goes to the values our Union stands for , and this shows how far we still have to go before women are treated as equals , always and everywhere . Of course , I know that I am in a privileged position . I am the President of an institution which is highly respected all around the world and , even more important , as a leader I can speak up and make myself heard . But what about the millions of women who can not ? Women who are hurt every day , in every corner of our planet , but neither have the power nor hold the office to speak up . When I arrived at the meeting , there were cameras in the room . Thanks to them , the short video of my arrival immediately went viral and caused headlines around the world . There was no need for subtitles . There was no need for translations . The images spoke for themselves . But we all know thousands of similar incidents , most of them far more serious , go unobserved . Nobody ever sees them or hears about them because there is no camera , because there is nobody paying attention . We have to make sure that these stories are told too and that when they are told they are acted upon . The Istanbul Convention is an important tool for that . In May , it will be ten years since the Convention was signed . It is a ground—breaking legal text and an inspiring document . It is the first internationally—binding instrument to take a broad approach to combating violence against women and children . The Convention prohibits psychological violence , sexual harassment and stalking and it outlaws domestic violence . I do not need to tell you how important it is , especially now in the times of pandemic . I used the meeting in Ankara to reiterate my deep concern about Turkey withdrawing from the Convention . The withdrawal of one of the founding members of the Council of Europe is a terrible signal . To be credible , however , we must not only criticise others . To be credible , we also have to act at home . You all know several Member States have still not ratified the Convention and others are thinking about quitting . This is not acceptable . Any kind of violence against women and children is a crime . We must call it a crime and it must be punished as such . This is why I want the EU itself to join the Istanbul Convention . This remains a priority for my Commission , but as the EU ’ s accession is stalled in Council , we will , before the end of the year , present alternative measures . We will put forward legislation to prevent and combat violence against women and children , offline and online , and we will – my second point – propose to extend the list of Euro—crimes set out in the Treaty to include all forms of hate crime , because Europe needs to send a strong signal that hate crime is not acceptable , because we have to make sure that women and girls are adequately protected everywhere in Europe , because what US Vice President , Kamala Harris , recently said at the United Nations is true : ‘ the status of women is the status of democracy ’ . The equal participation of women makes our democracies stronger - not because women are better , but because we are different . We see the world differently , we see different dangers or opportunities . For a complete picture of the world we need men and women . This is the only way we can make the right decisions , this is the only way we can be as successful as possible . On Friday I visited the Pfizer plant in Puurs ; there i have dr. Ozlem Türeci hit . She is co-founder and medical director of BioNTech , the company that developed the first approved mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 . As a little girl , Özlem Türeci grew up with her grandparents in Istanbul , then she came to Germany and studied medicine . BioNTech is now at the center of our vaccination campaign in Europe together with Pfizer . A campaign that is picking up pace every day : to date , 129 million people have been vaccinated in the European Union , around 26 % of adults have received at least one dose , and this week around 30 million more doses will be delivered - all over our Union , also thanks to Özlem Türeci . A story that shows the enormous power that is released when women have equal opportunities and their skills are respected . A story that shows why we need more women in leadership positions . And this is where the European Union should lead by example , and we are doing so : for the first time in the history of the Commission , there are as many women as men on the College of the European Commission . I would also like to achieve this success at all levels of management in the Commission – we are not there yet , but still : women currently hold more than 40 % of management positions in the Commission . I invite the other institutions of the European Union to follow our example . The Commission , of course , but also the Council , the administration of the European Parliament and the other bodies of the Union still have a lot of work to do . The Commission will therefore soon organize a meeting with the other institutions to discuss how we can all do better . Women represent half of the European population , and this must be reflected in the institutions , at the heart of Europe . Ladies and gentlemen , at the March European Council , the Heads of State or Government were very clear : respect for the rights of women is an important prerequisite for a resumption of dialogue with Turkey and for the enlargement of our common curriculum , but this is far from the only prerequisite . In Ankara , I again carried the message that Turkey must continue the de-escalation in the Eastern Mediterranean , that it must accept the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights ; these are our conditions for strengthening our economic cooperation with Turkey and for engaging in high-level dialogues on topics such as climate change , public health and regional issues . Under these conditions , it will also be much easier to free up fresh money to help Turkey take care of more than 4 million Syrian refugees . We welcome Turkish efforts in this regard . Ladies and gentlemen , when we talk about respect and dignity , we must not limit ourselves to equality between men and women . The question is much broader . We can not tolerate the proliferation of `` LGBT-free zones '' in our Member States , we can not tolerate Roma being discriminated against in Europe , and we absolutely can not tolerate the ugly face of anti-Semitism and racism which is displayed in every corner of our Union . Europe is so much better than that . And sometimes I am amazed that we even have to talk about such self—obvious things in this year of 2021 ; that we still have to stress the point that all across Europe people must have the same equal rights and equal opportunities , regardless of whom they love , where they do come from , regardless of how old they are and the faith they hold . Because this is the Union I believe in , a Union which lives up to its motto : United in diversity . For me , these three words have always expressed a solemn pledge at home and abroad , today and in future . Long live Europe . "

And this is where the European Union should lead by example, and we are doing so: for the first time in the history of the Commission, there are as many women as men on the College of the European Commission. I would also like to achieve this success at all levels of management in the Commission – we are not there yet, but still: women currently hold more than 40% of management positions in the Commission. I invite the other institutions of the European Union to follow our example. The Commission, of course, but also the Council, the administration of the European Parliament and the other bodies of the Union still have a lot of work to do. The Commission will therefore soon organize a meeting with the other institutions to discuss how we can all do better. Women represent half of the European population, and this must be reflected in the institutions, at the heart of Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, at the March European Council, the Heads of State or Government were very clear: respect for the rights of women is an important prerequisite for a resumption of dialogue with Turkey and for the enlargement of our common curriculum, but this is far from the only prerequisite. In Ankara, I again carried the message that Turkey must continue the de-escalation in the Eastern Mediterranean, that it must accept the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights; these are our conditions for strengthening our economic cooperation with Turkey and for engaging in high-level dialogues on topics such as climate change, public health and regional issues. Under these conditions, it will also be much easier to free up fresh money to help Turkey take care of more than 4 million Syrian refugees. We welcome Turkish efforts in this regard. Ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about respect and dignity, we must not limit ourselves to equality between men and women. The question is much broader. We cannot tolerate the proliferation of \"LGBT-free zones\" in our Member States, we cannot tolerate Roma being discriminated against in Europe, and we absolutely cannot tolerate the ugly face of anti-Semitism and racism which is displayed in every corner of our Union. Europe is so much better than that. And sometimes I am amazed that we even have to talk about such self—obvious things in this year of 2021; that we still have to stress the point that all across Europe people must have the same equal rights and equal opportunities, regardless of whom they love, where they do come from, regardless of how old they are and the faith they hold. Because this is the Union I believe in, a Union which lives up to its motto: United in diversity. For me, these three words have always expressed a solemn pledge at home and abroad, today and in future. Long live Europe.'\n",

      "Manfred Weber , on behalf of the PPE Group . – Madam President of the Commission , gentlemen , dear colleagues ! It feels like an eternity since the last European Council , but unfortunately the main topic that concerns the citizens of Europe is still there and in our thoughts : the COVID situation , the vaccination , the everyday life of the people and the people who still have to die too . The key question we can answer for citizens today is : Vaccination is picking up speed . First of all , I would also like to pay tribute to the companies , the entrepreneurs , the people who have made it possible in the past few weeks that we can now produce so many vaccines in such a short time and offer them to our citizens . There is an enormous amount of work and innovation behind it . Thanks for that ! The Commission has given answers based on the experiences of the first few weeks , the first months with this vaccination strategy - for example , we welcome the proceedings initiated against AstraZeneca : those who do not deliver must also be treated accordingly , and exports are also based on the principle of reciprocity . It is now time that we put an end to the EU bashing , that we confidently stand up and say : We Europeans deliver the vaccines , we supply our citizens with vaccines , and the selfishness practiced by other countries having is definitely not the way to go . Ladies and gentlemen , the central question that will concern us this week is the certificate that we will discuss - a second central building block of these European activities in the fight against the pandemic . It is good that we have now activated a fast procedure - I would also have wished that the Commission had put the proposal on the table a little earlier ; but it is good that we are moving quickly now because citizens expect to be able to regain some of their lives . There is great hope in this , and I would therefore like to make it clear to the EPP Group that , firstly , we will continue to place our trust in the EMA , the European Medicines Agency , when it comes to vaccination . It must assess whether vaccines are respected and recognized in the certificate or whether these vaccines are not recognized . The second thing is that when it comes to the costs of vaccination and , above all , testing , we have to be careful that there are no social divisions on this continent . In the light of subsidiarity , the issue needs to be weighed very , very carefully . And the third thing that concerns us is : If there is no longer any risk because people have been vaccinated , then they must also get their civil rights back . They must be given the opportunity to regain freedom of movement in the European sense . It is a European right , and that has to be restored through vaccination . Finally , on the subject of vaccines , I would like to reiterate that the issue of jobs is now before us . The social dimension of the COVID crisis will become more real in the summer ; I am therefore pleased that we will also be discussing tourism intensively this week . Dear colleagues , a second topic is on our minds today , and that is the visit of the two EU leaders to Turkey . The goal was a message of strength and the effect was a message of weakness and disunity . Where is the geopolitically respected European Union ? That is the question that remains after this visit . That is why we , as the EPP , ask that we clarify questions after this visit . The first question is : we do not have first and second class presidents . We have assigned various tasks in this European Union through the Lisbon Treaty , and we are campaigning for them , and we expect these issues to be dealt with properly . The second is what Ursula von der Leyen has now put at the center of her speech . In Ankara in particular , where the Turkish leadership questioned the Istanbul Convention , the impression was given that women were being discriminated against . A difficult , a problematic impression that has arisen . On behalf of my group , the European Peoples Party , I would like to point out that of the nine EPP Commissioners , six - two-thirds - of these EPP Commissioners are women . We are making a decent contribution , an important contribution , to ensuring that the Commission is managed on an equal footing between men and women , and that is why everything must be done in future – as Ursula von der Leyen has said – to ensure that this impression is not repeated . Thirdly , we need clear assignment in the diplomatic services so that something like this does not happen again . Finally , ladies and gentlemen , dear Colleagues : The contents , the list with regard to Turkey is long - with Syria , with gas , with Cyprus , with the migrants . For us it is not a question of opening a new chapter with Turkey , but for us it is a question of first of all rebuilding trust , and Turkey has enough possibilities in the Geneva talks on the Cyprus question and also in the gas drilling , this reliability to regain that trust . For us , this is a prerequisite for any further step in the matter of visa liberalization , opening of economic markets and other concessions . In this respect : The ball is in Ankara , we hope that the Turkish government will pick it up . "

A few days before your visit to Ankara , the Council in its conclusions insisted on maintaining a soft approach with Turkey . Well , I believe that continuing to give confidence and resources to an authoritarian regime on sensitive issues , such as the customs union and the management of migrants , is the result of a very serious error of assessment on the part of the Union . The sofa gate , in fact , does not represent only an unpleasant isolated episode or must not be read only as a failure to respect the gender issue , but is the result of a twenty-year failed policy in the relations of the Union with a country like Turkey . So I ask both of you , Presidents , what is the point of continuing to respond to crisis situations with paralysis by continually yielding to the blackmail of an illiberal regime ? In the last few months you have staked a lot , this House too has staked a lot on respect for the rule of law , coming to direct confrontation with some European countries such as Poland and Hungary with vigor . The same vigor that , on the other hand , I do not see used against those who usually silence political opponents and ethnic minorities with violence , erecting themselves as a bulwark of an Islamic fanaticism that is very dangerous , finally arriving with the nefarious decision to transform the Hagia Sophia into a mosque , to dangerously turn back the hands of the history of a century . You see , the respect that we have not demanded of Turkey in all these years and the inconsistency that we have made into a dogma , have questioned the very credibility of Europe , not only in the face of these illiberal regimes , but in the face of all the world . Last week , the President of the United States made a historic decision , recognizing the massacre of the Armenian population in the First World War as genocide .

When you decide to abandon the path of impossible compromises to finally take that of common sense, know that you will not be alone but you will find all the European peoples by your side.'\n",
