The war on whether Polish citizens can know the truth or whether the authorities are to decide what this truth should be. While lying that it is about more taxes, the authorities are really about more obedience to their citizens. Because the authorities want to cultivate the obedience of citizens with the help of the media they subordinate to. Like in Hungary. As in Russia. What should we do when the authorities of a European Union member state deprive their citizens of the right to reliable information? Again, Parliament is to say: we do not have our Brussels approval for this? Just talking again? Stomp your foot and scream? There is a limit beyond which helplessness becomes a humiliation. A humiliation for those who stand alone for freedom and democracy. As the Roman maxim, \"Vim vi repellere licet\" says, you can resist force by force. Force adequate to the threat. That is why I call on the entire European Union to act accordingly. That is why I call on all free media in the world to show solidarity with Polish free media. Because if it happened to us, it can happen to you. I end here. What is left of my time I spend in silence. For the silence to be a warning. Because if we do not react now with action, this moment of silence may soon become a minute of silence, of silence over the coffin of Polish democracy. And if it is Polish, then European too.'\n",

Although some measures have been introduced, such as the East StratCom Task Force, they have so far been insufficient to counter efficiently the assault on our democracies. After the riots in Capitol Hill, the ultimate price of allowing disinformation and hatred to spread unchecked online is clear for all of us. Finding a balance between limiting harmful content while maintaining freedom of speech might be a challenging task, but it is doable and it must be addressed now. I look forward to this debate, particularly as we now have a concrete opportunity to address these issues through new draft legislation, including the Digital Services Act, which will establish new rules, including on advertising, transparency, illegal content removal and data access. Continuing to improve the Commission’s code of conduct on disinformation is a necessary step. But we also need to extend our offline safeguards to the online world by limiting the use of targeted advertising and the profiling of users. I welcome the Commission’s initiative on online political advertising. We also need to explore ways to promote media literacy skills to increase users’ knowledge. With the GDPR, the EU led the way and set an example. Now we need to go further. The Digital Services Act can facilitate the development of our digital economy while protecting fundamental rights and providing increased security from online harms. This is our EU opportunity to lead the way, and I hope that we can do it together with our allies in the United States and beyond.'\n",

The giants of the web for years have claimed to be neutral containers. Today, however, it is clear that their policies affect the real world, proclaiming themselves censors of which messages are acceptable and which are not. And this leads us to a big question, which has precise political and legal connotations: who should decide what can be published in the digital space? You see, I do not think vested interests are at stake here. It is not a question of deciding whether to defend the ideas of a party or an individual elected, but to protect the values ​​of democracy and freedom of expression, even for the individual citizen. For this reason, as a League, we have asked for this debate. I believe that a possible darkening of the pages of Donald Trump or Ursula von der Leyen or a newspaper or anyone should be decided by laws that define clear parameters and procedures, and not thanks to homemade guidelines from private giants acting almost as judges of democracy. This is a role that belongs to the legislators, to which we cannot and must not abdicate. The European Union must act without delay to safeguard the democratic and free debate on social media.'\n",

However, we are not yet adequately protected from the proliferation of fake news, discriminatory content, incitement to hatred and violence. In fact, we have experienced how disinformation campaigns and foreign interference can find fertile ground to influence public opinion, to polarize societies, to undermine democratic processes. With the action plan for democracy and the proposals regarding digital services and markets, we therefore expect significant interventions to regulate opaque microtargeting practices and to obtain greater transparency on the functioning of algorithms in the procedures for controlling and moderating online content. . At the same time, however, it is essential to mitigate the risk of conflict with the freedom of opinion deriving from decisions adopted on the basis of the discretionary powers of an oligarchy of private commercial entities, rather than on the basis of rules that give greater guarantees of freedom and impartiality.'\n",

Mediators have fallen and now, on social media, everyone thinks they can abolish social communication and traditional media. Everyone thinks that through direct participation they can even replace parliaments. There is no lack of countries in which the abolition of parliaments is decreed or defended. No more mediators. Only direct participation, through social networks, with a vote that even in laws and decisions could be daily through digital instruments. The problem is that, suddenly, we realize that, behind social networks and the companies that own them, there is a mediator, a hidden mediator, a secret mediator, who is the algorithm, who is the controller, who is the owner. of social networks and therefore freedom of expression is in danger. It is in danger due to external interference, it is in danger due to hidden mediation, it is in danger due to lack of democratic regulation And, therefore, we cannot be in the hands of social networks. We have to put them in our hands. It is this challenge that is being debated here today.'\n",

It took them one year to act against fake news. And a study released this week reveals that 83% of young people have already been confronted with fake news on social media and 25% of them cannot distinguish between fake news and real news. And this is, in my eyes, a threat. For years, and I think I am not exaggerating when I say social media platforms and Trump, for example, have benefited from each other. Only after Trump’s election defeat and him calling on his supporters to storm the Capitol did they decide to ban him. That means that Facebook, YouTube and Twitter took more than four years to ban him. And while I think it was right to ban Mr Trump from social media platforms, I would say that private companies should never act without reference to the law, and as the European Union this is the way we have to go.'\n",

With such great power must come greater responsibility, because today there is very little incentive for social media corporations to ensure that their products are not used as vehicles for the mass spread of hate or lies or disinformation. In Slovakia, last year, journalists tracked 56 death threats posted publicly on Facebook, and actually had to call Facebook’s PR department before the death threats were taken down. So it was because of the action of journalists that the threats actually disappeared. This is illustrative of a much bigger problem, which is that the social media corporations are unable or unwilling to ensure that their content not only meets ethical standards, but actually complies with the legislation and the laws of the country in which they operate. So, when we think about the future, the regulation must not be virtual, but real.'\n",

The goal of the giants of the Silicon Valley in the beginning of their activity was to give people access to information for free, and their principle of \"do not do evil\". But that is how it was yesterday, and today is \"1984\" again, Orwell and other science fiction writers predicted the future. This time, however, it is for real. You do not agree with Big Brother, it will silence you, even if you were the president of the United States. Conservative views on the web are always the victim. Several Big Tech billionaires, in the name of leftist ideology, declared a war on freedom of speech, and their actions can be compared to the actions of totalitarian states. We are witnessing an unprecedented threat to freedom. Censorship and account blocking on the one hand, and digital surveillance and manipulation on the other. The passivity of the European Commission in the face of these monopolistic practices is astonishing. It is high time to take action and introduce regulations to protect freedom of speech online.'\n",

That is why, for me, the fundamental debate is that of impunity, that of the tolerance with which the narrative of the violation of human rights by the extreme right has been accepted and, from there, the use of social networks as a disseminator of hate speech. A danger. And, of course, it is normal for the question to arise: should it be a multinational that determines when and why the use of an account is limited or should it rather be a great anti-fascist consensus that gives rise to public regulation to do so? Of course, we believe that you should bet on the latter. The only way to guarantee the fundamental right of access to truthful information, the only way to eradicate hate speech, is the intervention of public powers, the firm alliance to expel hate from any public space.'\n",

Today, however, there are a number of verified and unverified information channels available to the individual that serve him in creating the truth. I am very worried about how easy it is to publish complete lies and misinformation and not take any responsibility for it, saying that it is about freedom of speech and thus discredit the target of the attack. Such and similar announcements, attacks, insults are mostly used today by the populist right, which undermines democracy with its autocratic tendencies and strives for fundamental human rights. They even see the free media as their enemies and not as a fundamental aspect of a free society. One of the more effective tactics for spreading disinformation proved to be the party appropriation of the newly created media, which serve exclusively to promote party ideology. Unfortunately, such practices are used by more and more politicians who slander and spread untruths about their political opponents in Slovenia as well, the Slovenian Prime Minister. Different views and beliefs are, of course, something completely normal. When constructive dialogue is replaced by lies and offensive or even hostile rhetoric, our democracy is really in danger. That’s when things go so far that a coup happens, like it happened on the Capitol. We are at a crossroads between freedom and the rights of the individual to express themselves, and I very much welcome the action plan presented by the European Commission.'\n",

But a truth that must be protected by censorship is a lie. Under the guise of combating so-called hate speech, they want to criminalize resistance against unwanted migration and multicultural depopulation. But just as a mother cares for her children, this resistance is not out of hatred for what is foreign, but out of love for what is proper. Democracy cannot exist without freedom of expression. It is not a matter of left or right, or of agreeing or disagreeing; that is a fundamental right that saves us all from tyranny. Censorship on social media should therefore be punished.

We need transparency of algorithm to fight disinformation, and we need transparency to help us understand how online spaces have become hotbeds of systemic inequality and discrimination.

Large social platforms are no longer simply social networks that make it easy to stay in touch with our acquaintances, but online interfaces that affect all areas of life: business, public services, art, culture, public discourse and thus politics. Developments in recent months clearly show that the leaders of technology giants have become political actors restricting freedom of expression where appropriate. In the absence of rules, they abuse their position: they delete, moderate, censor as they please. Much of the political expression now takes place on the World Wide Web, so freedom of expression on the Internet must be ensured at all times. Technology giants cannot be the arbiters of the public. Freedom of expression is a cornerstone of democracy and can only be restricted in exceptional cases and by law.

Thus, in France, is this the case, for example, of senator LR Sébastien Meurant, ex-LREM deputy Joaquim Son-Forget or even deputy Emmanuelle Ménard, all three censored by Twitter for having thought otherwise. To put forward a different idea is not a crime, it is a right. Our European Parliament would grow to defend freedom of expression against the new censors that are the giants of the Net.

The EU must stop putting these tech despots and their error—prone machines in charge of curing society and of preventing violence and crime, lies and hate because this only fuels the despot’s powers, and despots will use despotic means.

The debate must therefore be able to be conducted in complete freedom, both online and offline, without interference from any public authority and without respect for borders. This is stated in Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and is a fundamental principle that must always be respected in this House.

Populists are quick to exploit the advantages offered by social media, and where they have a grip on power they already started speaking about regulating it themselves. In my native Hungary, the Orbán government is already drafting national legislation to regulate social media and the internet.

From a formal point of view, Twitter can be private property, and by its function it is a deeply social entity. Therefore, freedom of expression in a democratic society based on the rule of law has an essential and irreplaceable value. Freedom of political speech is a litmus test for the state of democracy in society. About 2400 years ago, Diogenes was asked what is the most beautiful thing in life.

Their domination has become such that they have even cut off the accounts of the American president, yet reputed to be the most powerful man in the world. This oppression and censorship has lasted far too long. The European States and the European Union, which is nothing other than their delegate, must regain control of the situation. In accordance with the resolution of October 20, 2020 of the European Parliament, I call for the strengthening of public control over these platforms in order to guarantee freedom of expression.

The bottom line is that the freedom of speech of democratically—elected representatives, just like the uncontrolled spread of manipulative disinformation, cannot be just a private matter for global companies. Decisions on these issues need democratic scrutiny and regulatory oversight. It is therefore one of the key regulatory challenges of our era to draft a new set of public rules to respond to the power and potential dangers of social media. We need more ambition than is currently envisaged in the recently proposed Digital Services Act, especially when it comes to the responsibility and transparency of online platforms in the fight against hoaxes. The DSA is a much—needed step in the right direction, but we must do more to slow down the pervasive spread of manipulative and harmful content online. We will never be able to put an end to all deceiving lies, but we are surely able to give truth, facts, credible science and democracy a fighting chance in a digital space.

But, in recent times, there is a very worrying trend on the part of these communications multinationals. Millions of citizens are censored every day by officials who decide what is right or wrong to think behind a desk. Is it right that de facto monopoly companies have this enormous power? What is a free man but his word and the thought of him? Who is it that has the right to judge what is right or wrong? The judges in the courts or the Facebook and Twitter gentlemen who invented successful applications? The most disturbing element is that digital oligopolies are appropriating a real public function, namely that of deciding what is tolerable or not in the debate. In the rule of law it is the law that decides what is right or wrong, what is punishable or subject to censorship. These multinationals not only see themselves above the law, but also above European and national taxation. Small business owners and VAT numbers at this moment are harassed by the crisis and by the tax authorities, and perhaps even censored for their ideas on social media. Free citizens who want to have the opportunity to express themselves ask to be able to exercise this inviolable right freely, even on the Internet.

In a democracy, parliaments have to make the rules, not big digital corporations. Google has a market share of over 90% in the EU.

Firstly, favorable conditions must be created for the development of reliable media in the digital environment, so that high-quality media content is primarily available to users, and here the European Union must invest more in independent media and their digitization. Secondly, platforms must be subject to strict and legally binding obligations to deal with abusive and targeted conduct. The Kremlin trolls must not have a place in a democratic information space.

Unfortunately, the dangers of social media (not to mention criminal activity) are just as great, and the damage to democracy is catastrophic. Indeed, social media is also a platform for hatred of all kinds, for the most total disinformation and for conspiracy theories, and all this most often with complete impunity. The need for legislation is imperative. However, our public authorities are too slow. One can criticize the closing of the Twitter account of Donald Trump by the platform, but was the solution to leave it open? We must take into account the dangers to democracy. Too often, under the guise of \"democracy\", democracy proves weak. I believe it is the duty of democracy to defend itself. My freedom ends where the freedom of the other begins.

The lack of clear rules of the game and laws means that the platforms today remove content on arbitrary grounds. Many are now wondering: Why is Facebook deleting my posts and my account without explanation, and I have no one to call? Why do platforms allow threats, child pornography and illegal products to flow freely online? As my party group negotiator for the new Internet law Digital Services Act, I will work to create order in this digital wild west that prevails today. Then it needs to be clear that what is illegal offline must also be illegal online, and that it must then be removed from social media. We need to ensure fair competition that promotes innovation and entrepreneurship, and promotes the right to express your own opinion online as well. It must be guaranteed.

Proactive measures such as labelling misleading or unfounded posts online proved to be very helpful. But at the same time we should be mindful of striking a balance between safeguarding the civic debate and protecting fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression. We need to preserve the prohibition of imposing a general monitoring obligation and reconsider the liability exemptions for active platforms while providing for safeguards such as adequate oversight and judicial redress mechanisms. Finally, transparency over algorithmic decision-making will be key. As a society, we need to have a better understanding of the functioning of social media algorithms.

Figures in the latest reports of the European Commission on the removal of digital platform content show that since January 2020, Google has removed or blocked more than 90 million coronavirus-related ads in the EU for violating advertising rules, including drug misinformation. 12,390 Google ads blocked in Croatia, 10 million in Germany and 9 million in Austria. During November, the Facebook and Instagram platforms in the EU: removed 35 thousand posts due to misinformation that could lead to immediate physical harm, content related to bogus preventive measures or drugs. There is a fine line between the freedom of speech that we stand for and support and the spread of harmful content that can have far-reaching consequences for our health, security, stability of our societies, but also for disrupting democratic processes. We have made a big step forward by passing a package on digital services. Social interaction has also digitized the space of politics, but it also strengthens those so-called ordinary users to be the media, and we must find a balance there.

As a citizen of the European Union and as a program rapporteur, I am very happy about that. First of all, I would like to thank all of you from the bottom of my heart for your great help and support. We succeeded on time and without delay. Digital Europe today is getting its formal end, that is, its big operational start, which we honestly hardly all expect together. From virtual meetings and remote voting, paperless offices through supercomputers and artificial intelligence to smart homes and driverless cars. The digital revolution is happening fast and irreversibly. At the same time, the negative economic consequences of covida-19 will be severe and severe, and it is here that the digital industry plays a key role as a major tool for increasing European competitiveness and resilience. As a powerful tool for a better standard of living and a more comfortable life and daily work, as a driver of significant new sources of income based on the latest business models and services. It is digital as well as green. The main goal of this mandate. The main goal of this decade in our modern Europe, and the widespread application of digital technologies and solutions, is key to overcoming the investment gap that affects both the private and the public. In 2021, when we nostalgically remember the distant 2019, the importance of digital is unquestionable even for the biggest skeptics. Yes, we’ve all, whether we like it or not, digitized over the past year. Our work, business, private and business communication, socializing and free time. In the past year, everything has been digitized at an enviable speed, but in order to achieve a turning point in economies, this digitalization must be supported by a true digital transformation. This means a deeper change that deals with internal processes, human skills and our culture, because the rear of Europe is reserved for those who underestimate the importance of digital transformation. That is why digital Europe wants to contribute to strengthening a Europe in which digital technologies also enable better health and all public services in general. Better education, more successful fight against climate change, digital transformation of public and private companies, transport, tourism, industry, medicine, the whole economy and the whole industry. Equally important, with Digital Europe we want to strengthen the trust our citizens have in digital technologies by absolutely protecting their privacy, security and consumer rights, while increasing the transparency and speed of services provided. With Digital Europe, we want to contribute to achieving European digital independence and strengthening competitiveness in the global digital economy, but at the same time we are responsibly approaching new generations, new processes and new jobs. The Digital Europe program will play a significant and powerful role in the coming years, but I want to remain absolutely realistic in my predictions. 7.5 billion euros is a lot of money. With this money, for example, one Croatia can significantly accelerate its transition to e-society. However, Digital Europe is only one and in itself limited aid, one program, and it is not a program to build digital capacity with the most European money. Therefore, it is important that there is cooperation and synergy between European programs, that there is coordination, that it is known who is working and in what way. Complementarity with other programs is important, for example with the Horizon Europe program, which with its almost 100 billion euros covers a much wider area, as well as with the multiannual financial framework 2021-2027. Digital and green, ladies and gentlemen, are therefore two indispensable items of every next European program and project, and the key priorities of the programming period ahead. If Europe wants to become a leader in the coming years and not remain a follower, green digital Europe really has no alternative. Take, for example, the field of health and vaccine development. The challenges we have been facing for the last year due to the coronavirus pandemic are absolutely unprecedented. In such difficult times, we need a ready and strong Europe more than ever before. A Europe that has the most advanced technologies, a Europe that has top experts, a Europe that can defy the virus on its own, a Europe that does not lag behind the global technological superpowers but catches up with them, a Europe that develops its vaccines and a Europe that invests huge amounts of money. We need that. Digital Europe is our biggest ally on this path and one of the most important programs whose activities and funding contribute to the further development of all European countries, both today and in the future, in all aspects of life, including health and medicine. Today, digital Europe has its long-awaited and needed operational start. From today, Member States such as Croatia are taking great responsibility.

First, we need to ensure that they’re not forced into a technical infrastructure that they can’t escape from. Second, we need to ensure that the dominance of certain actors, for example in the data market, does not translate itself automatically onto the machine-learning and AI markets. And third, we need to ensure that the new standards that are being set for data sharing and such are not decided in a closed circle just between a couple of Member States and between a couple of big companies.

Primarily, we insist that any use of artificial intelligence in the education, culture and audiovisual sectors must fully respect fundamental rights and freedoms as set down in the Treaties. AI can enhance the education process if it’s used wisely, contributing to digital skills which will be so important in the future. About 40% of children today will work in jobs that do not exist yet. I therefore welcome the Commission’s intention to update the digital education action plan in this regard. We highlight the need for safeguards in the use of AI for children, who are more vulnerable and therefore deserve particular attention and protection. There must always be the possibility for human intervention to ensure that no bias is found in the systems and there are equal opportunities for all. Let me conclude my remarks by calling for an open regulatory framework for artificial intelligence where benefits in the education, audiovisual and cultural sectors are maximised and risks minimised.'\n",
    "raw1_105 = 'Laurence Farreng, on behalf of the Renew group. – Mr President, Commissioner, thank you first of all to the rapporteur, Mrs Verheyen, for this very important report. Artificial intelligence represents an immense opportunity for players in education, culture and the European audiovisual sector. Whether it involves more interactive learning devices, particularly linguistic ones, or enhancement of our heritage, artificial intelligence opens up many possibilities for our performance and our competitiveness. It is therefore essential, as we are asking in this group for this report, to allow everyone equitable and fair access to this digital technology. However, this also obliges us to take up several challenges: first, the strengthening of the digital skills of Europeans and the adequate training of teaching staff; then, the structuring of a competitive and attractive cutting-edge research sector for European researchers; finally, the development of an artificial intelligence that is ethical from the design stage and emblematic of our European values, such as cultural diversity, gender equality or freedom of expression and information. Europe therefore has its full role to play in meeting these challenges, through its “Horizon Europe”, “Digital Europe” and “Creative Europe” programmes. However, artificial intelligence also has its dark side: deep fakes, which make it possible to fake speeches, or the accelerated dissemination of false information. Against these practices, we will have to preserve high-risk areas, such as education, and also fight even more strongly against disinformation. In this respect, we expect a great deal from the framework project proposed by the Commission a few weeks ago.'\n",

The culture committee naturally asks different questions than the industry, employment or consumer committees. But the EU AI strategy is not just about liability issues for self-driving cars, to put it bluntly. Think of Cambridge Analytica and its electoral influence, of machines that win literary competitions and have long since distributed more than self-written weather reports. Then it becomes clear: A socio-political approach to a European AI strategy is overdue. The use of AI in education, culture and media is full of the digital gender gap. According to studies, one in ten women in the EU has suffered some form of cyber violence since the age of fifteen. AI deployment may block, discriminate, or influence opinions by using data without consent. The report now calls for the Commission to consider recognizing education as a high-risk area in its AI strategy. And the bottom line is that he recommends rewriting the AI ​​white paper so that our culture, our democratic dialogue of the future, also takes place in it with an ethical, transparent and non-discriminatory AI. Our group will definitely agree with this approach.'\n",

The rapid and exponential development of artificial intelligence in a growing number of areas poses many challenges. In this regard, the report is the first one to take a socio—political approach to an artificial-intelligence strategy, to democracy, inclusion, securing freedom of speech and data security by looking at education, culture and media in the development and obligations of AI. Nevertheless, I would like to raise a couple of issues: first, the importance of stressing non—discrimination, eliminating gender stereotypes, and developing inclusivity, also in data collection and its development; and, second, a gain for linguistic diversity and language learning. In this regard, we advocate for AI as a tool offering a specific potential for innovation, specifically for lesser—used languages in Europe.'\n",

The European Parliament calls for the assessment of the role played by artificial intelligence, the development of the opportunities offered by these technologies, but also the adequate information and protection of users. We are the authors of this digital transformation and we can set the rules and principles, including ethical ones, based on which we develop these technologies, making the process more humane and inclusive. Artificial intelligence cannot replace teacher empathy, but technology can help increase the quality of education. Artist creativity should not be replaced by an algorithm, but future content creators can use technology to generate higher revenue. Developing artificial intelligence education and skills is essential. Europe can be a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence, but it can also be a leader in ethics.'\n",
    "raw1_109 = 'Deirdre Clune, rapporteur. – Madam President, shaping the digital future, removing barriers to the functioning of the single market and improving the use of artificial intelligence for consumers – that’s what we’ve been working on for a number of months now and I want to thank my fellow shadows and their offices, and those committees who have contributed opinions to this report. We’ve had strong cooperation, resulting in a balanced report that clearly identifies areas we believe can and should be acted on to improve the functioning of our single market in the digital area. The last 12 months and more have demonstrated to us the value of digitalisation and how it can contribute to bringing people together, to connecting businesses to consumers and connecting business to business. But we can do more to make our single market work better for citizens and businesses, make European SMEs, micro-businesses and larger companies more competitive, and improve their potential to compete globally. As always, we need to remove unnecessary and unjustified barriers that occur at national level and emphasise the need for a strong European approach that gives certainty to enterprise. European companies should engage with an EU approach to regulation and not have to engage with 27 Member State approaches. This certainty will encourage entrepreneurs and others who want to expand and establish themselves in the European Union, as they will know that the EU is a place where they can do this. They know for sure what’s expected of them. There will be no barriers, no borders, just a market of 450 million citizens and the support of European regulation that provides legal clarity. European regulation that is trustworthy, fully compliant with fundamental rights, consumer protection rules, data protection rules and is non-discriminatory. These are the traits Europe has established for itself and as a leader worldwide, and the traits we also want to embed in our digital rules. Of course, this approach is always essential for our public services that support our citizens, regardless of where they reside. As we continue to deal with COVID and the fallout from the pandemic, as we face our ambition of implementing the EU Green Deal, and as we reorganise our healthcare services, digitalisation and emerging technologies such as AI can and will contribute to reaching these objectives. It is really encouraging to see that 25% of the EU rescue fund is going to be earmarked for digital and we must not waiver from that. Funding for SMEs, innovation and tech entrepreneurs is vital if we are to facilitate the development of the EU tech space that we so badly need. If we look at our global competitors in the AI sector, like the United States or China, we can see that more private sector investment is encouraged there than it is here in the European Union. Yes, we have our InvestEU, our Horizon EU and other programmes, and these are enormously successful, but we must also introduce policies that leverage private sector investment in terms of venture capital or seed capital. We need that private sector investment to ensure that we don’t have scale-ups for sale here in Europe, and we don’t have start-ups that will scale up in third countries. We want EU successes. I really welcome the Commissioner’s recent proposals to support artificial intelligence through regulation, proposals designed to encourage its use and, importantly, to encourage consumer confidence. AI has enormous potential to address many of the challenges that we face today in the healthcare sector, agriculture and transport, and in developing our smart cities. The list is endless and it does go on, but AI is not without its drawbacks or its risks, such as lack of transparency or traceability, or lack of human oversight, bias decision-making, etc. These need to be addressed through regulation. We already have our data protection rules, privacy rules, non-discrimination rules, but we need to protect consumers as we do with product safety and liability. We need the same protection online as offline, but there are gaps and these need to be addressed. We need to inform consumers on the use of artificial intelligence, where it is being used and when they are engaging with it. Consumers have a right to be adequately informed in a timely and easily accessible manner where AI exists and the possible outcomes, how the system is established, is checked, how it can be contested and how it can be corrected. This is a very important position that we have reflected in our report today, because we believe that these criteria are essential if we want to encourage consumer confidence, and they will in turn feed into an ecosystem that allows AI products and technologies to develop. There are risks with artificial intelligence; I don’t deny that. In some areas of operation, the risks will be higher than in others. And we want to see a risk-based regulatory approach that would regulate the highest risk and, as consequence, for lower risks we would have less regulation. There must be the possibility to also prohibit harmful or discriminatory practice. We don’t want to see a binary approach to risk evaluation that could become quickly obsolete, but rather a forward-looking approach that is not application-specific but that gives certainty to developers, certainty to investors and indeed confidence to consumers. So artificial intelligence and the future regulation that we are going to be dealing with in this House are important. It will send out a message that Europe can be a leader in this area, as we were with the General Data Protection Regulation. There are gaps. I think it’s another ideal opportunity to lead internally but also to lead on a global basis in terms of how we can deal with AI and boost confidence, both for consumers and for business.'\n",

How can our digital future be designed in a way that enhances the use of AI for consumers? I think: first of all, create legal clarity. For me, that means closing legal loopholes, but not reinventing the wheel. The existing sector-specific regulations must not be undermined in the process. Second: Producers and users need a reliable, clear and future-proof legal framework for AI that enables innovation and protects against discriminatory applications. Third, AI-based robotics and the Internet of Things must be secure. The authorization of products on the internal market should therefore depend on the risk associated with their use. And – last, but not least – SMEs and start-ups need support in using AI and in manufacturing products that contain AI. If we consider these four points, we will be able to take an important step towards AI made in Europe.'\n",

It is the natural consequence of the information economy and as such must be accompanied by rights. To improve working conditions and, above all, to ensure wage upgrades, that is, a fair distribution of the surplus value produced and the costs saved by human-machine synergies, which must remain, as my colleagues and especially LIBE have said, in which I am also a member, anthropocentric, that is, a tool in the hands of man and not the nightmarish opposite. The protection of personal data, trade union presence and action in the new digital environment, that is to say, democracy, platform taxation and the elimination of discrimination in the choice of employees, must be ensured. The algorithm is a goal in the service of man, not the nightmarish opposite. We can build the foundations for a new reality. These are great tools created by man, and man must taste them.'\n",

We want to promote artificial intelligence in the European Union, and this promotion, ladies and gentlemen, can only succeed if we create the right and uniform foundations for it in the internal market. More specifically, this means that we must remove unjustified national barriers. Especially new ideas from small and medium-sized companies must not be nipped in the bud with over-regulation. We must therefore be very careful with blanket bans on individual technologies, and this is where the report of the European Parliament differs very positively from the most recent proposals that we have seen from the European Commission. Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, we need to create legal clarity for consumers and for companies - we need regulation for the entire internal market. To ensure that robot-assisted operations or software that sorts CVs in a hiring process do not have a discriminatory effect, we need clear and uniform rules that stand up to European standards.

Algorithms control intelligent vacuum cleaners – we are of course very happy about that – but they also lure consumers to buy online, make decisions in a human resources department or about creditworthiness, yes, they can even be used for automatic mass surveillance. These are then the problems that we have to tackle in order to make it clear that we want to make a policy for the people, in the interest of the people, so that the positive potential of this artificial intelligence can be used, but at the same time also the damage that it causes can also actually be limited and prevented. This means that we have to support and protect consumers in particular, because if an algorithm is faulty: How is a normal person - including me - even supposed to recognize where the problems are coming from, what the reason for this problem is? If the application of artificial intelligence can result in fundamental rights, human rights and civil liberties being infringed upon, then we must also resort to prohibition, because we cannot accept such technologies being used.

Since the health emergency we have also understood that it is necessary to build a regulatory environment conducive to innovation and consumers, to avoid the fragmentation of the digital single market and to eliminate any unjustified obstacles that still exist in the promotion of artificial intelligence.

I thank the rapporteur for the inclusive way in which a large number of these principles have been incorporated into the report.

First of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Clune, on this important report, which undoubtedly lays the groundwork for how we should deal with artificial intelligence and the technologies to come. Artificial intelligence is one of the technologies that will drive the development of our industry, of our SMEs, but it is not the only one. It is clear. This will give way to more developed technologies, such as quantum computing, with a potential for multiplied computing capacity. That is why it is important that the legislation we adopt now is prepared for the technologies to come and does not become obsolete in a few years. The arrival of technologies such as quantum computing will make it possible to address more complex problems, in a more agile way than current ones. In addition, it will reduce energy consumption, thus helping to meet the objectives set by the Green Deal. These technologies have great potential, but they also carry great risks, since they feed on data. That is why it is very important to ensure the protection and quality of these data, both personal and non-personal. There is a fine line between the use of personal and non-personal data once it enters the artificial intelligence system. That is why we have to be very rigorous and comply with clear transparency rules that establish red lines, if necessary. For example, we must avoid abusive or discriminatory practices towards consumers and companies caused by the biased use of data in the machine learning process. Otherwise, the consumer or SMEs will not trust these technologies and will hamper their development. As Vice President Vestager has said, in AI, trust is a must, not a luxury.'\n",

As shadow rapporteur in the ITRE committee on the data governance act, I explored the issue of data accessibility by micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, which find it difficult to have the same opportunities as large ones, a concept reiterated here earlier by the Commissioner. We need to make small businesses more competitive and prevent European start-ups, created perhaps thanks to the support of the framework programs for research and innovation, from turning to markets in third countries. Lack of high quality or non-use of data would make it impossible for micro and small businesses to expand and slow down the digital transition, with obvious damage across the entire supply chain in Europe.

In agriculture, artificial intelligence is not yet widely used, and its potential could significantly affect the efficiency of the sector. By 2050, the population is to exceed 9 billion: on the one hand, a huge population will have to be fed, and on the other hand, the actions of the Union resulting from environmental policies promote non-extensive, ecological agriculture with less production capacity. Therefore, it is necessary to implement innovative solutions in agriculture that will improve production practices and reduce the consumption of resources. In particular, it is necessary, in accordance with the resolution, to first ensure that adequate funds for the zonal transformation of small and medium-sized farms are ensured, reduce the risk of losing jobs in rural areas related to the use of new technologies and ensure that funds from the Horizon Europe program allocated to agriculture are fairly distributed between the countries of Western and Eastern Europe.'\n",

During the coronavirus epidemic, both teachers and students acquired new skills in education. While this has not been easy many times, I am confident that our children will be able to use this knowledge in the future, even while working.

As a European Union, we now have the opportunity to set the standard worldwide and thereby protect European industry and implement our standards and values, if we set the bar high enough. It is therefore important that future legislation is even better packaged in regulations so as to achieve fully harmonized legislation from which Member States cannot deviate in order to undermine the leverage of the internal market. The internal market is the most important weapon worldwide of Europe, and we must use it. We must not fall into the problems often used by Member States. We also need to ensure that start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises have easy access to finance so that they can fully exploit the opportunities offered by artificial intelligence.

Technological innovation has changed our life and the future holds still other innovations: certainly artificial intelligence constitutes the new frontier of this technological progress and, if regularized and used appropriately, it will guarantee the development of all areas of our economy, including agriculture in which there is a lot of interest on the part of young people and in difficult areas, where thanks to intelligence it will be possible to produce better and more easily. Indeed, in the Commission White Paper on agriculture and in the new Common Agricultural Policy, artificial intelligence is an essential component for the future of the sector. The new technologies developed by artificial intelligence will also be fundamental for achieving the objectives of the \"From producer to consumer\" and biodiversity strategies, in the interest of producers and consumers, promoting better production quality, optimizing natural resources, guaranteeing animal welfare, reducing pesticides and fertilizers, improving the traceability of products.

    "raw1_135 = 'Ylva Johansson, Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank you for this report and a special thanks to Mr Petar Vitanov for this report. I hear, I know that you are concerned about fundamental rights, and so am I. This summer, gangsters shot down and killed Dutch journalist Peter R. de Vries in cold blood. An attack on a human being. An attack also on our society and our values, on our fundamental rights: the right to life, freedom of expression, freedom of the media. Police caught the suspects within the hour with only a fragment of the getaway car’s registration number. Using state-of-the-art camera systems, the police forced the car to a standstill on the motorway. Smart digital technology used in defence of citizens and our fundamental rights. Without this technology, these criminals would have quite simply got away. To protect both our people and their rights digital technology is no longer a “nice to have”, but a “need to have” or law enforcement. First, because of the massive amounts of data. In one German state last year, the police seized 3 000 terabytes of data in child sexual abuse investigations alone. They estimated it would take one police officer more than 2 000 years to review, and that’s assuming an officer working eight hours a day looking at one picture every second. A computer processes these images 10 to 20 times faster at least, 24 hours a day, never gets tired, makes fewer mistakes, doesn’t get sick from what they see, does not need therapy. And time is of the essence. In the EncroChat case, Sky ECC and Trojan Shield, the police captured hundreds of millions of messages with criminals plotting drug deals, violent crimes and even murder. Delays can cost lives. Second, criminals increasingly use artificial intelligence to commit deception and fraud, cyber attacks and ransomware attacks. We cannot ask the police to bring a knife to a gunfight. We must equip the police with modern tools to fight modern crimes. Third, we need up-to-date information exchange to fight cross-border crime, and I will address this in the upcoming proposals on a police cooperation code and the update of the Prüm framework. I know you are concerned about the rights to privacy and data protection, and I must stress that we must both protect security and respect fundamental rights at the same time, that’s essential for the trust of our citizens. We need to demystify technology and explain the strong safeguards that already exist. A balanced approach and strong safeguards should govern the use of technology by law enforcement, anchored in national laws, guarded by data protection authorities, subject to redress mechanisms and parliamentary oversight. There is oversight on European level by, for example, the European Data Protection Supervisor and the Joint Parliamentary Scrutiny Group on Europol. The Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights have built up a body of case law that is relevant for the use of technology by law enforcement. Procedural rights are already guaranteed: the right to effective remedy, to a fair trial, the rights of defence and the presumption of innocence. I also agree that AI applications must fulfil robust legal and technical requirements, in particular when they are used by public authorities. The legal accountability for the eventual harmful effect of such systems must be clearly assigned. And this is why these issues are addressed in the Commission’s proposed AI regulation. We need a European approach to ensure safety and full respect of fundamental rights when artificial intelligence is used. The proposal recognises AI as a strategic tool for law enforcement, to fight terrorism and organised crime. The regulation will facilitate the use of artificial intelligence in a transparent, reliable and secure way, also for law enforcement authorities, by providing clear rules. And I completely agree with you: there is no room for mass surveillance in our society. Our proposal bans mass social scoring and prohibits live biometric identification in public spaces, with a few very well-defined exceptions. But the police must be able to use AI and digital technology for high risk cases with a potential adverse impact on fundamental rights. AI must live up to the highest standards. It must be robust, secure and accurate. The quality of data must be exceptional. Its use must not lead to a discriminatory or racist outcome, and it must be subject to human oversight. When artificial intelligence affects people, people must have the final say. Let me end by saying again that we must protect both security and fundamental rights, and I am convinced that we can, and this is what our citizens want. I hope that you are ready to work together with me to uphold our values and keep our citizens safe.'\n",

Thus, in police and judicial matters, where information technology can allow decisive progress for the safety of our fellow citizens, in particular our children, you limit its use. You claim that artificial intelligence would reproduce and even amplify discrimination, which would force it to forbid certain conclusions and to be as blind as you in the fight against delinquency. You refuse an intelligent system for detecting lies at the borders of the European Union, when 80% of so-called unaccompanied minors are in fact adults and 70% of asylum applications are rejected because they are unfounded. You claim that the American George Floyd case, which does not concern us, is proof of alleged racism by the police, and demand national plans to fight against the police rather than against the thugs. We expected this report to talk about artificial intelligence, criminal efficiency, the safety of our fellow citizens and we only have laxity for offenders and ideological lessons for law enforcement and honest citizens . Since Europe does not want to seriously control its borders and fight crime, then the Member States will have to take their destiny into their own hands and decide by election or referendum on the vital questions of security and sovereignty: c is exactly what Marine Le Pen will offer in France in March 2022.'\n",

We should have analyzes that compare the functionality and efficiency of human and algorithmic decision-making fairly, and make better decisions about it.

We do not want the comparison of biometric facial features to gradually become a standard procedure in police work.

We have a strong report on the table that clearly states the potential for discrimination through AI, because algorithms can promote social and racist thought patterns. The amendments tabled by the EPP Group thwart that. In the case of biometric facial recognition, it is not just the risk that citizens automatically become objects of suspicion that is relevant. There is also ample evidence of mistakes - of getting innocent people into trouble. Biometric facial recognition, once accepted as a standard, is mass surveillance and a serious invasion of privacy. And that is exactly why any form of surveillance without cause must be prohibited.'\n",

But at the same time, we also see often that they provide new avenues for organised crime. It was true for the internet, it is certainly also true for artificial intelligence and machine learning. And at the same time, these technologies can also help us to have huge potential in helping the 1.5 million police officers in the EU to effectively fight crime. They can help in identifying criminals on the run. They can help forecasting criminal activity, and they can help us in finding counterfeit goods and currencies. And we need to look at that potential with an open mind and avoid a situation where criminals profit from AI but law enforcement cannot use it to fight them. Yes, there are risks involved, and good safeguards absolutely need to be in place. AI needs to be transparent and trustworthy, and we need to make sure that using AI in the field of law enforcement will never compromise our values. But let’s also not be naive. Let’s not make the mistake to only focus on the risks and ignore completely the potential. Several colleagues have said it already: AI is here to stay, and its use will only grow in the coming years. And we only have to look at some countries outside the European Union to see what we should not be doing. We need a balanced approach. We need a European approach, because innovation is in our European DNA, as is our ability to create artificial intelligence in a trustworthy, human-centred and valued-based way. Let that be our European trademark in the world, also for law enforcement applications.'\n",

Hackers and criminal groups across Europe are too easily entering the computer systems of public institutions and private companies. For example, they have hit health facilities in Italy, France, Germany and Spain, putting their functioning at risk. Artificial intelligence must become a fundamental tool in the hands of law enforcement to fight cybercrime more effectively. But there is not only the repression of criminal phenomena. Much more needs to be invested in prevention, strengthening the defenses of personal data that can otherwise end up in the data black market. We need to create effective barriers against hackers and use artificial intelligence as a kind of infiltrator, thanks to which law enforcement can block possible attacks before they occur. Prevention is much more effective than cure.'\n",

I am therefore of the opinion that the rather good is that it points to the positives of artificial intelligence in criminal proceedings, and also points to the negatives. In my opinion, as a long-standing judge, I believe that care must be taken in the use of artificial intelligence at the time of court decisions. There, however, it should only exceed the human element, because the decision on guilt and punishment is always individual and no algorithms can apply it to the situation. After all, here in this room too, the President is deciding from time to time, he has to decide, and if that were not the case, there would be artificial intelligence instead of Mr President and artificial intelligence instead of MEPs, because based on algorithms we would know how we have to decide. The potential for the misuse of artificial intelligence in the protection of human rights and freedoms must be avoided, but in principle and in principle, artificial intelligence is beneficial in the fight against crime and must be encouraged and developed.'\n",

The use of this tool has proven to be a real asset in the context of certain criminal investigations, the fight against terrorism or border control. Thus, in the terrifying case of the Paris attacks of November 13, 2015, it was partly thanks to this technique of artificial intelligence and facial recognition that the investigators were able to identify, locate and arrest the suspected terrorists. However, its use must of course be done under strict control. Indeed, its use must be limited and proportionate, and always be accompanied by human supervision. There must be real work on transparency regarding the technologies used, as well as democratic and above all judicial control over its use, making it possible to avoid any bias and ensure respect for fundamental rights. Dear colleagues, the use of artificial intelligence in criminal cases can be an asset for criminal investigations and for European justice. Let us not deprive ourselves of it, while respecting fundamental freedoms.'\n",

Almost all areas of our lives are permeated by technology.

These are all achievements through MINT professions, and the need for specialists in MINT areas, but also in the growing digital sector is constantly increasing, and companies are desperately looking for qualified employees. Anyone who has been trained in a MINT profession is one of the skilled workers of tomorrow, with many doors open to them and excellent career prospects. Girls and women need to jump on this train. We have to ensure that they have the framework conditions that enable them to develop their talent accordingly. The early and gifted support for young women in STEM fields must be expanded. Girls have to go through internships and projects at school – and why not already in kindergarten? – be introduced to MINT. And we must ensure that women can successfully combine work and family life. This also means that fathers and men are more involved in this area. As a trained carpenter, I know exactly what it feels like to have to prove yourself in a male domain. And role models and mentors are needed to encourage young women and girls to pursue their path in the MINT field and to end the outdated understanding of gender roles. I therefore hope that the Commission and the Member States will take up and address our suggestions and demands.

According to a 2019 UNESCO report, only 28% of all researchers in the world are women. The reality for women is that they continue to be undervalued in all sectors of science and technology. This report is a good opportunity to focus on the structural barriers that hinder the development of potential talent. Gender stereotypes and hostile work and educational environments, where high levels of sexual harassment are reported, prevent girls and women from entering a field that remains overwhelmingly male. Added to this is the intersectoral discrimination suffered by women in situations of socioeconomic disadvantage, with disabilities, those who live in rural areas, migrant women, those of the LGTBI group, or racialized women. That is why we encourage the Commission, the Member States and educational institutions to take preventive and concrete measures. Because this absence of girls and women not only conditions the development of these individual potentialities, but also society as a whole. The way we, for example, tackle climate change, improve health care or deal with digital transformation must also have the voice of a woman.

Prejudices, the gender gap, the underrepresentation of women and stereotypes are repeatedly mentioned as the obstacles that need to be removed. The report emphasizes the need to engage in dialogue with relevant interest groups and stakeholders to address the grievance of fewer women in STEM professions. Interestingly, the report lists all the actors and stakeholders here - all but the one it should be addressing: the women themselves. All of these reasons are based solely on external factors over which women have absolutely no control. That is why politicians must now take resolute action, thereby underscoring the fatal image of women conveyed by this report as a weak, helpless victim. A 20-page report in which women are attested to their helpless situation does not fight stereotypes, but celebrates and manifests them. The fact that the women are not even asked shows very clearly that it is not about them at all. No, the chief ideologues are really concerned with the construction of a beautiful, new, colorful, CO2-neutral, gender-fair Tralala world in which people, just as they are, are just a nuisance.

One thing, however, you must clarify: if you say that we need pink quotas to favor women over men, you admit that there are women and men, but at the same time, if you sponsor the gender LGBT thesis, you affirm that being a man woman is only our choice. . So, applying your theories, if I tell you tomorrow that I feel like a woman, I automatically get the right to re-enter a pink quota. Right that I lose if I then go back to feeling like a man but that I get back if I feel like a woman again and so on. Not to mention transgender, all gender, pangender and a thousand other invented identities. Will you propose an ad hoc fee for each of them?

The subject of gender equality in training and employment in the field of science, technology, engineering and mathematics is essential, as the European Union faces an unprecedented shortage in this domain. Only one in six information and communications technology specialists is a woman in the European Union. We must reverse this trend. I call on the European Commission and Member States to do more and adopt accompanying measures and targeted actions to break down the barriers that stand in the way of girls and women from an early age. The report outlines avenues to be undertaken, for example the fight against gender stereotypes and the need for mentors and female figures to identify with. I would like to emphasize the importance of digital skills for the future of work. All the studies show this, especially those of the ILO. I am for this purpose, to illustrate it, in the process of developing an initiative in Marseille, at home, where I will encourage young girls from disadvantaged backgrounds to train in coding, in digital skills, to open up opportunities for them. careers.

In my experience as a teacher at a polytechnic university I have seen it up close. The students and teachers are a minority. We have to break the glass ceiling and empower girls to take up these careers. The future European Education Area must serve us to fight against stereotypes that undermine the capacities of women in these sectors, promote gender equality through specific measures and create inclusive digital learning.

But the fact that we are here today and discussing another report, that in 2021 - while the conditions provide for gender equality, and over time many reports of the European Parliament, if only partially implemented - this equality will What has not been achieved so far demonstrates, and we must acknowledge, the failure of the European Commission and the European Council to implement the obvious: gender equality at all levels. I feel a proud European, I am a Europeanist, but it is an insult to the European Union that it has not achieved gender equality, equal representation. We are talking about equal representation in the digital world, in the sciences, where only 17% of women are involved in start-ups. This in itself is a coup, a slap in the face for everyone and for the European Union. The European Union was to be the Defender, the defender of the rights of women across the length and breadth of humanity. Here we see a country, Turkey, withdrawing from the Istanbul Convention and, from this step, the European Commission and the European Council tell us that Turkey is a strategic partner, at a time when it is grossly violating the rights of women and millions of women. they are, in fact, under the regime and the boot of Turkey where their rights are being violated - and we continue to fund and support them.

We have successfully pressed the reset button with the Biden administration. After the grounding of the Airbus—Boeing dispute at the EU—US summit in June, we also agreed to hit the pause button on the steel and aluminium trade dispute. Our agreement includes starting discussions on the new global arrangement on sustainable steel and aluminium. Of course, we remain attentive and active on a number of US policy developments that may affect EU interests. Those could be the increase of the US domestic content via the reinforcement of ‘Buy American’ or the use of tax incentives, for example for the purchase of electrical vehicles. But overall, it is clear that our trade and investment partnership remains a global engine of prosperity. Beyond resolving our trade disputes, we must create space to find new avenues of cooperation and deal with the challenges and opportunities of the future. In this respect, the first meeting of the Trade and Technology Council (TTC) at the end of September represented an important step in the right direction, as well as an important political signal. We are ready to lead the way in setting the standards and rules for the technologies of the 21st century, putting our core values at the centre. We are addressing environmental challenges and market opportunities for clean technology, and we are ensuring more resilient and secure supply chains, in particular in semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and critical materials for our economies. The trade component of the TTC is of particular importance, and we have determined shared principles and areas for export control cooperation, especially on dual—use technologies. We also agreed to cooperate on best practices in investment screening, for example, on risk analysis and risk mitigation, in relation to sensitive technologies. There will be a special focus on SMEs and on policies that can accelerate their uptake of digital technologies. We will work together on global trade challenges like non—market economic policies and practices, the protection of labour rights such as combating forced and child labour, and addressing trade—related aspects of climate and environmental action will also be part of our work. Finally, we aim at avoiding unnecessary barriers to trade in new technologies while respecting our regulatory autonomy. We have thus set in motion a whole range of work strands that we will now pursue with vigour. To ensure concrete progress, we will meet regularly at principals’ level. The next meeting is scheduled for spring 2022 in the EU. There is strong willingness on both sides of the Atlantic to make our cooperation in the TTC a success. We are counting on your support for this. Members of the European Parliament, but also national governments, are essential in raising awareness around the fact that the benefits we gain from transatlantic cooperation will also require some compromises. We are committed to providing the European Parliament with information on the work of the TTC and we are committed to a transparent and inclusive engagement with key stakeholders and civil society at large. Stakeholder engagement also figured prominently in the first TTC meeting. Last month, the Commission also opened a One—Stop Shop to collect continuous stakeholder input on the platform called Futurium. I strongly encourage you to promote this point of contact among your constituencies and stakeholders. We also encourage stakeholders on both sides of the Atlantic to join forces and, wherever possible, work together to shape joint transatlantic positions.

In the 1990s, we were hoping that China and Russia would join the world of free research, free enquiry and freedom in general, and that they would at least abide by the rules of the World Trade Organization.

It’s a totally different child, and this is really important to have in mind and also to make public. Second, it’s really important to set the impact for the challenges of the future specific to the field of trade – so standards on artificial intelligence, the question of subsidies, the question of export controls. All this has to be discussed, to give also some input to global trade, to the World Trade Organization.

It doesn’t even mark the beginning of the end, but hopefully it marks the end of a new beginning in sorting out some of the issues. This assessment is borne out by what we see as a result of the recent trade and aluminium deal that you negotiated, Executive Vice—President. This is a welcome result, even though it is weaker than we had hoped and issues do remain. Even more important strategically, I believe, is the standard—setting dimension going forward. Shaping the future, not just sorting out legacy issues. And there we have to work very diligently with the US because this is of geopolitical relevancy.

For example, of course, like everyone else, I welcome the American openings on the issue of tariffs on steel and aluminum, but at the moment they only serve some exporters but they will only increase the shortage of steel that exists in this moment for our producers in Europe, on which I think we will need to intervene further. And then there are issues concerning the geopolitical credibility of us as institutions because, on the one hand, it seems to me - I have said it before - we must always be Atlanticists, even when the Republicans rule, not only when the Democrats rule. And then some cases, such as the one that emerged from a journalistic investigation in recent days that speaks of German engines sold to Chinese warships, when here, even in this Chamber, there are deputies who have been sanctioned for their positions on the China or others who went to Taiwan a few days ago.

The talks of the delegation from the Trade Committee of our House last week in Washington made it clear that the TTC is probably the most important mutual attempt that can be seen at present to rediscover US-EU cooperation. At the same time it became clear: The most important topic for the USA is the USA – Buy American. The second most important issue for the US is China – strategic and systemic rival. The importance of the partnership with the EU is measured by whether the EU, as an economic competitor, is prepared to follow American interests, and also by how prepared the EU is to side with the USA in the conflict with China. It is in this framework that the TTC is now being placed and given planetary interests - looking towards Glasgow - we must make intensive use of the remaining time to stake out common interests. The TTC will only be fruitful if it does not mutate into a body for securing global dominance in technology and industry, but rather, with its working groups, with the planned broad stakeholders, consultations and exchanges of opinion, serves as a real dialogue forum for sustainability and overcoming poverty. Why should we not take up American ideas for a trade policy that puts its workers at the center? We just have to transform it to serve workers in every country in the world.

Is it a forum to mediate on thorny legislative issues, or a place to simply discuss? Is it a tool for exchanging ideas or do you want a basis for a future transatlantic agreement? In short, if the commitments made are not binding, as has been repeated many times, what is the level of commitment and commitment of the partners, especially vis-à-vis some collective challenges such as measures to limit emissions or artificial intelligence?

I think the EU is really on the right track in fighting the harmful business models of big platforms that always choose profit over safety of effects. And of course, I think some things still need to be strengthened, for example, in the USA, when it comes to transparency of algorithms and tackling problems caused by targeted advertisement or strengthening the consumer angle – some of the things Frances Haugen also mentioned, and I hope this Parliament will do so.

We can still see people who are basically hypocrites.

The recent meeting of the EU-US Trade and Technology Council in Pittsburgh, where the EU and the United States demonstrated that they can meet the technological challenges of the 21st century and that they can best tackle them at the transatlantic level , was therefore of great importance.

The enthusiasm is legitimate, the political subjectivity of the European Union consists in belonging to the Atlantic axis with the United States, but this agreement also documents the existence of a wound. The wound that for some time, politically, has seen this axis in difficulty: on Afghanistan; on the match linked to the battle against climate change; on defense, with the AUKUS agreement. So the point is, on the one hand, the technological defense - transparency in algorithms and so on - and commercial, but on the other, who will take on the political responsibility of leading this huge game. Politically, by whom will Europe be guided in exploiting the content of this new agreement with the United States?'\n",

After a turbulent summer we are picking up on the positive momentum – from lifting the travel ban, joint environment commitments in Glasgow, meetings on the highest level, suspension of the aluminium and steel trade dispute, the Pittsburgh meeting – to name a few. In my capacity as a standing rapporteur for relations with the US, I fully recognise the importance of the TTC for our overall relations. It’s one of the key pillars. We want to see sustainable, ethical and inclusive digital and green transitions that benefit our citizens. I would like to underline the issue of transparency and parliamentary cooperation. Even though the TTC is not negotiating a new comprehensive trade agreement, we learned our lesson from the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. This is why I join calls to involve parliamentarians from both sides in your work. We are ready to contribute to this positive agenda.'\n",

And our agenda is finally on the right track. But we must ensure that this doesn’t become just a talking shop. We need to prioritise. We need to make tangible suggestions. The goal of each meeting should be a concrete result and concrete action. The procedure to implement any decision will, however, take time, so we need to move quickly, or it may be too late. Some have pointed out that the TTC should not turn into just a China-bashing exercise. They are right, but we cannot ignore the geopolitical reality and who our main competitor is.'\n",

Trade is a prerequisite for growth, prosperity, development and innovation, but it is also a tool for securing peace and security. \"Trade needs democracy,\" said the US Secretary of Commerce when she visited us this summer. But democracy also needs trade. When we look at the world with trade policy glasses, it becomes clear that democracies must work together, just as the EU and the US are now doing in areas such as digitalisation and technology. We must have high expectations of this collaboration, that it will increase competitiveness, deliver less hassle and less bureaucracy - which benefits both companies and consumers - and stimulate green technology development that helps us reduce emissions. We expect new common rules to be based on democratic values ​​with respect for human rights and integrity. Every new bond that is forged between the EU and the US is important. The leading democracies of the world are strong. We stand even stronger together.'\n",

I welcome TTC as a fresh start to chart our common values and to deepen the EU-US alliance. We will work with all allies who want to maintain free, fair and rule-based trade. Therefore, it is important that we now weave together our ambitions, that we maintain secure and resilient supply chains for digital products and services and that we fully support globalization. Of the ten working groups, I would like to focus on the one about small business owners today. My question to the Commission is: What is the objective of the Commission in the work of The Trade and Tech Council for European small businesses?'\n",

With the grounding of the Airbus-Boeing dispute and the suspension of the Section 232, the tariff conflict, we can once again focus on building rather than on repairing. It is the mark of good policy not to let the perfect be the enemy of the better. You have taken your responsibility in doing so and created the basis between punch-all effects from Trump’s divisive trade policies for good. We look forward to seeing tangible results coming out of the TTC, in particular in the fight against distortive trade practices and subsidies. And we hope this can give impetus as well to the multilateral process on this. I have said it before: when the EU and the US quarrel, Beijing and the Kremlin rejoice. But when the EU and the US work together on setting the standards for the 21st century, the world finally pays attention, and that is exactly the way forward.'\n",

I certainly welcome the first statement of the Council, which emphasised the importance of workers on both sides of the Atlantic, on shared values and also on SMEs and the working groups that have been set up under the Council. It is striking that some elements of open strategic autonomy are clearly there in the statement – for example, balancing the encouragement of foreign direct investment on the one hand, but also investment screening. But advancing any trade agenda requires a high level of scrutiny and particularly parliamentary scrutiny. So I wish to add my voice to those who’ve already asked what the role of the European Parliament is in scrutinising the work of the Council and the working groups set up thereunder. Finally, I would like to welcome the statement made by President von der Leyen yesterday reaffirming steadfast American support for the Good Friday Agreement and against the triggering of Article 16.'\n",

It would be good if the standards for the use of new technologies and the use of trade as an instrument of economic development were imposed precisely by the cooperation of the United States with the European Union - here we have a really great opportunity. Therefore, I wanted to ask about a possible aspect of this cooperation. I ask the Commissioner: what place do you think will be in the future of cooperation between the European Union and the United States in the field of space? This is a place where we can really offer a lot to the world, make good use of this part of the world - space - in relation to economic challenges and international cooperation.'\n",

I had a failure, from my point of view, with TTIP, I hope we do not get to the same point and I hope we learn from what happened in the TTIP negotiation. In fact, the thing that I still see unclear is the harmonization of standards, the abandonment of the principle that the United States is very fond of, \"Buy America.\" Basically, we, the European Union market, as vice-president of the internal market, say that we need an agreement with the United States. At the same time, we need equity, we need similarity, we need the support of SMEs and I am glad that it has been said here that you will take it into account. But I want to know what the next steps are and how you see it with the European Parliament, because I think we cannot just rely on what you are discussing there without making decisions and when, what the deadline is and what steps we are taking to reach such an agreement.'\n",

Last week I was in Washington with the mission from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and there was openness and a warm welcome on the part of our American counterparts. But I also felt a certain level of uncertainty or non—clarity relating to the immediate objectives in several of the ten Working Groups that have been set up. For instance, in Working Group 3 on Secure Supply Chains we are right now at the phase that we are doing mapping and the exchange of information. We are talking about the US and the EU Chips Act, but it’s more like mirroring things rather than having an integrated approach. So what I am kindly asking you is, how do you perceive the kind of cooperation that we had, for instance with Pfizer—BioNTech, when the subsidies played together? Is that the future that we can see in terms of objectives?'\n"

The use of smart working, online commerce, Internet services and apps have favored the criminal activities of hackers to the detriment of consumers and businesses, especially smaller ones, which are more vulnerable precisely due to the lack of know-how. and the resources needed to invest in cybersecurity.

I accept that platforms should not have the right to easily silence a president, of course, but what are the rules that would make this impossible in the future? I believe our job is to create them, and we are indeed on the right track. But in order to create them, we need to make sure we have clear definitions and visions of how we actually treat platforms. Do we consider them to be media? Are they a type of providers similar to cable TV operators? Or are they simply an environment in a place where everything is possible and can happen?

Because what we can do is we can exchange information, we can discuss things that we disagree on. We can align points of view and – I think very importantly – we can be specific. Let me take the question of semiconductors. Here what we have agreed is to collect information on both sides and then to establish a common analysis as to what are the reasons for the chip shortage that we are faced with right now. Obviously, it’s really, really difficult to do something about it on short—term notice, but we can make our future, mid— and long—term actions, be informed by the causes for the short—term shortage that we are faced with right now. I think that those important insights will make our work also for the European Chips Act and for a European Chips Strategy so much more solid. The ten working groups are indeed different because they have a different focus. Working groups, for instance, on standards, will not only be focusing on setting EU—US standards, but also on working together in multilateral standard—setting forums. I think it is not to be underestimated how important it is to have such early warning cooperation to know what is being brought up, what is at stake. Because we know that there are others who want to set their standards also in multilateral standards—setting organisations. So, we can coordinate our approaches to key global technology, to economic issues, to trade issues, and because of that we can deepen transatlantic trade and economic relations, basing this on politics where our shared values get a specific concrete expression in real life. I think the second example of that is the work that we are doing on artificial intelligence. The first result was to align our point of view that the critical thing here is to have a risk—based approach, so that when AI is used in cases where fundamental values might be at stake, this is where we should focus. In order to make sure that we have an innovation—prone approach to artificial intelligence so that we can use it as much as possible. So the first step is to align our way of thinking. The next step is to see if we can develop common tools in order actually to see if common principles are being upheld. Because there are thousands and thousands of producers, of coders, of programmers, of future users of AI, who would want to know how to make sure that they are on the right side of our principles. Here, of course, we have an obligation to develop tools that will allow that to happen. As you’ll also see, we have a working group as to how to enable small and medium—sized businesses to be part of the technological development. I think that is really important, because the work we do here is actually to open the market so that small and medium—sized businesses will have a much bigger chance based on their merits, on their talent, on their ideas, on their work ethics, actually to get to their customers – which also, of course, chips into the question of platforms that I mentioned in my introduction. One of the things that I will mention to bridge into how the European Parliament can be involved is the One—Stop Shop that Valdis Dombrovskis mentioned in his introduction, because outreach to stakeholders and the scrutiny of the European Parliament is part of what can make the TTC a success. So, we have this website where one can both interact with us, but where also papers become available as soon as possible so that it is open as to what it is that we’re doing. I think that is very important. I hope that you will promote this in your constituencies for the different stakeholders for whom it is important. The meeting that we had under the leadership of a Member of this Parliament, Bernd Lange, with a number of other committee chairs being invited, is part of the answer to the question as to how the European Parliament can be involved. I think this debate is also part of how the European Parliament can be involved. And, of course, for us to prepare the next meeting, we will discuss in the set—up chosen by Parliament as to how Parliament can be involved in the preparation of the next meeting. Last but not least, I share some of the remarks made about China. If you look at our AI proposal, you will see that there are use cases where we find it really crucial to say these uses are forbidden in the European Union, because this is not a place of surveillance. This is a place where data belongs to people and not to the state. But I think the key to success of the TTC is that we want something with the Americans and they want something with us, because we have something really strong in common: old democracies, strong fundamental values, the respect of the individual with the integrity of their dignity as the starting point. I think the only way to excel in this world is not to try to answer what other people are doing. It is to find our own way to excel, to over go, to show what we really are about. I think the TTC is part of that puzzle, next to all the many other things that this House is initiating, that this House is pushing the Commission to do, that this House enables Member States to do. Only in that respect can we deliver to European voters what has been promised. Thank you very much for the strong support and for this important debate.'\n",
    "rawmv2 = 'Mr President, honourable Members, thank you very much for the invitation to come here with Valdis to have this exchange and to debrief you on the first meeting of the Trade and Technology Council (TTC). Our digital partnership with the US plays an important role in enabling us to deliver on what we have set up for this digital decade. We have an opportunity to set a vision for a democratic and human-centred digital transformation, both at home and obviously also around the world. And following the successful first meeting in Pittsburgh on 29 September, I think it is clear that the TTC has a huge potential. We spent one and a half days together with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and US Trade Representative Katherine Tai. We had positive, frank, direct discussions. We do not always agree on every topic, but I think that shows that we are not just a talking shop: we aim for concrete deliverables for making progress on the issues at stake. Now the TTC will focus on the actions identified in the joint statements, where the 10 working groups have been given specific tasks. Valdis has taken you through a number of these very important points. So let me just briefly touch upon three areas of particular importance when it comes to the technology side of the Trade and Technology Council. First, on artificial intelligence, we agreed in Pittsburgh to develop trustworthy AI to oppose the use of AI that violates fundamental rights. To achieve this, we will develop mutual principles, concrete implementation tools and also value-based innovation projects. And I think this outcome shows that there is no transatlantic contradiction between promoting innovation and protecting our fundamental values. Second, on semiconductors, we will work on rebalancing global supply chains with a view to enhancing security of supply, both for the US and, of course, the European Union. We will, as a first step, jointly identify gaps and vulnerabilities behind the current chip shortage, sharing our assessment of information collected from industry. As the next step, we will discuss how to cooperate in our respective investment strategies. We both want to strengthen our domestic capacities while sharing the aim of avoiding a harmful and expensive subsidy race. We need to diversify our sources of supply to avoid single points of failure, ensuring that we can rely on them also in times of crisis. I think that is a very important lesson that we all learned from the pandemic. Last, on platforms, the Pittsburgh statement shows that we have built consensus on a set of common challenges, but also shared concerns. These concerns have even been, I think, more relevant after the testimony of Frances Haugen in this House earlier this week. As a first step, we will work with the US on urgent topics such as algorithmic amplification, transparency and data access to platforms by researchers. Both sides have committed to robust and continuous engagement with a broad range of stakeholders, including civil society, to ensure that there is sufficient buy-in, ownership, so the outcomes of the cooperation will have real effects on ground. For this to be successful, it requires the close involvement of the European Parliament, and as Valdis just said, we really welcome the strong support for the TTC, also shown by the visit of several committees to Washington DC last week. As Valdis said, next spring in Europe, the venue and the date have not been set yet, but it will be here within the Union. And of course we hope to keep our engagement with this House ahead of this meeting.'\n",

    "rawtv = 'Tom Vandenkdelaere (PPE). – (NL) Mr President, the GDPR has now been in force for more than two years and we cannot ignore it: the regulation is proving its worth. It ensures better protection of personal data and wider awareness among the population and sets the standards worldwide. Thousands of companies have done their utmost to be fully GDPR compliant. They have also made the necessary investments to achieve this. I would like to make three comments today about our data policy. Firstly, we must not be blind to the shortcomings and problems that have become apparent in recent years. We must recognize that the GDPR is time-consuming and expensive for SMEs and everyday associations. In addition, the application and enforcement are not the same in every Member State. This disrupts the proper functioning of the internal market. Secondly, we must not hinder the exchange of data with third countries. Indeed, adequacy decisions with third countries are crucial to enable companies to exchange data with each other in a smooth and GDPR-compliant manner. Third and last, there are the new technologies, which are often based on artificial intelligence and require large amounts of data to work properly. The GDPR should not hinder the European Union in the global race for innovative strategic technologies. That is why I, together with my group, call on the Commission in the coming months and years to fully assess the effects of the GDPR on those new technologies and to devise a plan so that they can continue to thrive and develop in the future.'\n",
    "rawtv2 = 'Mr President, AI will shape our future. It will change how we work and live, whether it is in health care, agriculture or, yes, law enforcement. The question isn’t whether we like it or not, the question is how Europe will deal with this change. And one thing is clear: AI is here to stay. Already today, criminals are shifting their operations. Whether it is in organised crime, terrorism, child porn, money laundering or human trafficking, it happens online. For me, law enforcement authorities must be able to use the full potential of AI to fight criminals. It will allow them to fight criminality faster, more efficiently and in a more targeted way. And yes, that includes facial recognition in public spaces – on the condition that all fundamental rights are guaranteed and that there is no room for bias. And, colleagues, don’t get me wrong. This does not mean that we want to give police forces carte blanche to do whatever they want. It’s our duty as policymakers to set up a strong legal framework within which they can safely use AI while guaranteeing the safety of our citizens. It’s too easy to argue for moratoria or bans without taking into account the challenges our police officers deal with on the ground. If we really want to be serious about setting up, putting people at the core of trustworthy AI, as we said we would, then it is also about their safety and the benefits AI can bring to better protect ordinary citizens and police officers alike. How do we do that? It’s simple. Let’s not get trapped in focusing on certain AI applications and tools, but let us assess each use in its specific context against a set of principles and values, and that is what we should be discussing. Proportionality, necessity, limiting the use in time and place, transparent and strong democratic oversight, and prior legal authorisation where necessary. That’s why I think this report falls short of the expectations people have and why my Group presented amendments to it. Digitalisation of our society is inevitable. We cannot be blind to this new reality. It is our duty, all together here in this House, to find the right balance between the use of new technologies on the one hand and the protection of our fundamental rights on the other hand. We have to remain vigilant, but we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater.'\n",

    "rawapz = 'Ana Paula Zacarias, President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, recent weeks have shown that even the most robust democratic structures are not safe from damage. What happened on the other side of the Atlantic must inform our debate in Europe, as our democratic societies are not immune to the harmful influence of hate speech, disinformation, fake news and incitement to violence. These events have also shed light on the increased importance of online platforms and social media companies in shaping public debate. They have highlighted the growing interconnection that exists between digital transformation and democracy, which is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency. It is unquestionable that social media companies have the status of public squares, which means they should have responsibilities when it comes to enhancing citizens’ participation and ensuring freedom of expression. Nevertheless, freedom of expression is not absolute. It should be balanced with the goal of combating illegal hate speech, incitement to violence and radicalisation, both online and offline. What is illegal? What is illegal offline must be illegal online. Online platforms have repeatedly been criticised for the lack of transparency in the use of algorithms, on content moderation and for targeting users on the basis of a vast amount of personal data generated from online activity. The digital space has also become a breeding ground for conspiracies and fake news. Disinformation spreads faster than any virus. Education, media and digital literacy are the best vaccines against that. We expect online platforms to play their part in this common fight, but it is up to the democratic institutions – our laws, our courts – to set the rules of the game, to define what is illegal and what is not, what must be removed and what should not be. Without democratic scrutiny and a level playing field, there is a risk to users’ rights, information flows and public participation. The protection of fundamental rights requires transparent and consistent rules for all of us, including social media outlets. The recently proposed European Democracy Action Plan, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act are important steps forward and will make the digital environment more transparent and actors like social media companies more accountable. The Council has already started the discussions on these important instruments. These initiatives must also be considered in conjunction with the upcoming Media and Audiovisual Action Plan, which will be the subject of the Council conclusions that we intend to adopt during our Presidency. In addition, we are expecting, for the third quarter of the year, a Commission legislative proposal to ensure greater transparency in the area of sponsored content in a public context, complementing the Digital Services Act. The Council is ready to cooperate with this Parliament to ensure adoption sufficiently ahead of the 2024 European elections. Moreover, the Presidency will host the Digital Assembly in Lisbon in June, where the concepts of digital democracy and digital rights will be discussed. The Presidency intends to consolidate the idea that Europe is a reference in the digital era and that our values and way of doing business are a competitive advantage. We want to place this idea at the heart of the European Digital Strategy for the next digital decade. The Presidency will also hold a high—level conference on the future of journalism and its interconnection with artificial intelligence, with a special focus on the robotisation of news production. The current times have brought into sharp relief the unavoidable reality that what is happening online shapes our lives, beliefs and choices. It deeply influences what we buy or who we vote for, who we listen to, and even our opinion on vaccines. In its recent conclusions, the Council stressed the need to foster a well—functioning digital public sphere, greater accountability and improved transparency in addressing disinformation. Countering this scourge is crucial to preserve open political debate and the effective participation of citizens. We need to prevent social media functioning as an echo chamber which suppresses different points of view, and we need to make sure our citizens are equipped to manage the flood of information they are exposed to every day. In times such as this, believing in unreliable information may be lethal. We welcome, therefore, the work on the Rapid Alert System and other monitoring instruments. We encourage support for media and digital literacy, media pluralism, media independence and fact checking. Let me reassure you that the Presidency is committed to working with the European Parliament, the Commission and the European External Action Service on these crucial issues in order to promote and protect our fundamental rights and our democracy.'\n",
    "rawapz2 = 'Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Parliament for this valuable contribution to this debate and I would also like to thank the Commissioner for her responses and, at the same time, ensure that the Council remains committed to ongoing work to protect and promote fundamental rights of our citizens. This matter must be the subject of a constructive and transparent dialogue between the co-legislators and the different stakeholders. We have to talk with platforms, with civil society, with experts, for the good of our citizens. The Council firmly believes that digital technologies can make a significant contribution to the protection of fundamental rights and democracy, provided that democratic processes, the necessary checks and appropriate balances are safeguarded. How to adapt our legal instruments to the speed and immediacy of the online world? How to achieve and guarantee the right balance between freedom of expression, media pluralism and the protection of the rights of our citizens against online hatred and disinformation? How to improve the digital education of our citizens? It is for these answers that we need to work with the European Parliament, seeking legality, transparency, diversity and freedom of expression. The variety of information and the plurality of voices are an integral part of our democratic systems, but let us not forget that safeguarding them also means ensuring protection against violence and hatred, the protection of minors, the protection of consumers. The digital space needs to be safe for all of us. This is also part of the rules of democracy.'\n",

    "rawvj = 'Věra Jourová, Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for organising this debate. I know we don’t have much time, so I will try to be brief rather than exhaustive in my introductory remarks. Social media has transformed the way we communicate with each other, debate on political issues or do campaigning. There are a lot of new opportunities, but also a lot of problems. With the recent attack on the Capitol, we’ve got a tangible yet tragic proof that many people have simply lost trust in democratic institutions. Going online only exacerbated many of the existing problems and cleavages in our societies. The US events are the moment of reckoning, also because they reminded us of the power Twitter, Facebook and other technological corporations possess. The fact that they can permanently remove an account of a sitting president based on vague criteria and unclear oversight is really worrying. Even though, I believe President Trump’s irresponsible incitement to violence deserved action, it is high time to reign in the unchecked power of the digital corporations. Whatever we do, we must uphold the principle of freedom of speech. I do not want to create the ministry of or arbiter of truth. This is the main principle. So what can we do? First, we need tougher regulation, more enforceable obligations and to increase the responsibility of digital players. We have recently proposed the Digital Services Act, that will increase accountability of online platforms and clarify the rules for taking down illegal content, including hate speech and incitement to violence. This is a ground-breaking proposal, and will also give us the tools for stronger monitoring and enforcement of the obligations of online platforms. We need these rules urgently and we are ready to work together with you and the Member States to quickly adopt this law. What can we do already now, while waiting for the Digital Services Act to become law? We can equip ourselves already now with better tools to fight disinformation and harmful content. The European Democracy Action Plan is our map of what we should do next in this respect. We can already now strike a new pact against disinformation with better accountability of algorithms and no arbitrary decisions by big online platforms. We can and should have more transparency of their policies and access to relevant data. In the Digital Services Act we moved away from assessing harmful content and focused on the manipulative techniques of online distribution. We need to go more in detail on this – paid promotion and paid likes, reactions from fake accounts, bots can be particularly dangerous for democracy, notably during elections. This is why I will propose new regulation on online political advertising. And freedom of speech is not the same as freedom of reach. Regulation alone will not, and in my view should not, address all the details of digital life. When I talked to Mark Zuckerberg and other CEOs of the Big Tech, we discussed solutions that go beyond regulation because we must not sacrifice freedom of expression, which requires open space, be it online or offline. They cannot judge and evaluate every piece of content posted on them. This is why we need to reshape the thinking of tech companies and tech workers. Architects follow not only law but also ethical codes to ensure that the buildings they design are safe for people. Coders and IT experts should have a similar approach when designing their algorithms, something I rarely hear from the tech executives. And third, we cannot focus on social media platforms alone. We need to make our education fit for digital reality. We all have to become more digitally literate, understand the basics of what is happening online and why we are seeing certain content. This will allow us to navigate safely online. As a person coming, as many of you do, from an ex—totalitarian country, in my case communist Czechoslovakia, I have tasted life without democracy and freedom of speech. I believe we need to bring order to the digital expression of democracy and to end the digital Wild West. What is illegal offline must be illegal online, but we also have to work on restoring trust among citizens. Facts belong to everyone. Opinions belong to an individual. And this distinction has been damaged and can only be repaired if there is trust in science, in authorities and society. We all have a very important role to play in this as well.'\n",
    "rawvj2 = 'Madam President, I want to thank the honourable Members for this debate and for all your opinions and views. For me it is extremely important to hear the opinions of this House because this is the first broad debate about if, and how, to regulate the Internet if I may simplify that. And I take several main messages. First, what I heard from the vast majority of you is: it’s time to get to work. If we are not ambitious to become the rule-makers we will continue to be the rule-takers, the rules which have been created in Silicon Valley and which are imposed on our territory in the EU. So it’s time to get to work with a sense of urgency and I very much count on the European Parliament and your approach to adopt the legislation which the Commission proposed soon enough. Also because we see a lot of impatience on the side of some Member States who want to go their own way. They want to have their own rules for the Internet and I think that it was quite clear also from this debate that we want to have a pan-European smart solution without any fragmentation by Member States. The second main message which I got is that we are searching and working on the ideologically-neutral solution that the rules we are going to adopt should not be left or right, and that we will seek the solution which will protect the freedom of speech as the primary principle. So these are the main messages I took from this very important debate. Coming back to the rule-makers, what we are doing is the continuation of the effort of the EU to be the rule-maker with global effect. We already managed to do that with the GDPR where we said that individual people must have the right to have their identity, their privacy, under control. And now we are coming with a set of, I hope, consistent rules which are also consistent with the GDPR and its philosophy. We are coming with the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act, the European Democracy Action Plan, and by all that we want to prove that the EU has a very healthy instinct when it comes to the risks which we see on the Internet and which can cause big harm to our societies. What I heard from many of you was that the digital big tech grabbed too much power and too little responsibility. I would add I agree with that. The platforms captured a lot of public space. I sometimes say that they privatised the public space, and this is a public space without any public scrutiny whatsoever. So this is also our task: to demand more transparency and more accountability, because what’s happening online is heavily influencing real life. I think it was Mr Tudorache who said that there is no difference between online and offline, that it’s one world. I tend to agree with that. On the other hand, it’s quite easy to blame the Internet and platforms for all our troubles. I think that we should really take a lesson from what happened in the US at the beginning of January. The platforms for the transmitters of the messages of the former President Trump who was inciting violence, whipping up the crowd who then invaded the Capitol, and there were victims, there were dead people. So I think this is also a very strong goal on all of us who have influence on public opinion and on the reaction of our society to be more responsible and to be aware that social media can be a weapon, a dangerous weapon in our hands. I am not calling for self-censoring for politicians. I am calling for more responsibility and awareness of the consequences when we use these social platforms and social media. I would like to recommend that you read Madeleine Albright’s book Fascism: A Warning. She speaks about social media as a weapon when it is used by bad people, when it appears in bad hands. Let me react to several comments regarding disinformation in the time of COVID. I’m sure you know that the Commission has an agreement with big tech to do more against disinformation. So it’s not true that they have just started now, and I appreciate the recent announcement of Facebook that they want to do more against disinformation relating to vaccination. The agreement is simple. I wanted them to enable more space for information from authorities, from health authorities, from those who are responsible for communication and for providing the people with trustworthy and evidence-based information. For the health sector I think that is a very clear message: if you do not occupy the space it will be occupied by disinformation. The Ministers of Health are aware of that and they do their best. I have to praise them for everything they are doing in this very difficult moment and crisis, and they are doing their best to occupy the space with reliable information. The thing is that the people have to trust the information provided by the health authorities. The fight against disinformation also contains what we offer or what we propose. It contains fact-checking. Honourable Members, let me do this now. I have to react to Mr Haider who said that the EU has not invested anything into the development and production of vaccination. This is fake news, and I think that if something like that is said, it’s also our obligation to come with the facts and deny that. I also want to react because we speak here about the freedom of speech. I want to react to those who were mentioning the situation in Poland. I think we all have seen the black screens. The black screens are quite telling. I think they are screaming. Today it’s a question of protest of the media in Poland, expressed in a black screen. Tomorrow black screens might become a sad everyday reality. We also need to protect the freedom of speech by supporting independent media, not by suppressing them with additional financial burdens. This doesn’t apply only to Poland. We have recommended many times to the Member States that they should support also financially media who are also the frontrunners in the COVID crisis, media which were already before the COVID crisis under big financial distress because the business model has changed brutally. The money from advertisers is being shifted to the online sphere which we keep speaking about today, and so we need to guarantee that the media can do their job because they have a very important role in our democratic societies. So coming back to the law which we are now analysing. I have to say that we always advise the Member States to support media, as I said, but coming to the law, we are aware of the draft law and we need to look into it in more detail. We expect Member States to ensure that their fiscal or other policies will not affect the commitment to ensuring a free independent and diverse media ecosystem. I have to add that about the legislative process, which is ongoing in Poland, that it is important to consult such legislation also with the media sector, and I understand from the recent information from Poland that this is foreseen. I am sorry, I probably was longer than I wanted to be, but I really wanted to react to many of your very important opinions, which I had to take.'\n",

    "rawhv = 'Henna Virkkunen (PPE). - (FI) Mr President, social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have provided wildly new opportunities for people to interact and interact. What are the rules that have been followed on these platforms? They have been based on the commercial interests of these platforms. Now their economic and social power in the world has grown so great that it can no longer continue. It is important for us in Europe to ensure that the laws that we have in place in society are equally valid on social media and on the internet. It is important that European values, democracy, freedom of expression and human rights, are realized online, as they are in the real world. It is also important to translate these into legislation more closely, and this work is currently being done. At the same time, it is important to remember that when we want to combat rampant disinformation, propaganda, false news, the most important way is still to invest in the skills of people. Good literacy, good digital skills, high-quality and free media are also the best and most effective ways to combat false news, propaganda and disinformation. That is, while we are clearly making the Internet rules that what is illegal in other societies in Europe is also illegal on the Internet, we must also support the knowledge and digital skills people have.'\n",
    "rawhv2 = 'Mr President, indeed, the past pandemic year has accelerated digitalisation across Europe, making this report on the data economy even more important and timely. I would like to thank all the rapporteurs and colleagues for their good work on this important report. In the EPP Group, we have wanted to emphasize in particular the importance and contribution of SMEs, micro-enterprises and startups in this report, because it is important that they, too, have better access to the potential of the data economy. It is also important for us that investment in the digitalisation of companies, both private and public, is stepped up throughout Europe and that we direct funding to education and research in this area so that we can really take advantage of all the opportunities that the data economy will bring. Highlighting the potential of SMEs in particular is now important in the next steps, as SMEs are a huge part of our economy and provide an increasing share of jobs. So we have to look for solutions, not just what the report now focuses on. Streamlining data flows is certainly important, but better ways must also be found for SMEs to make better use of the data they already own and produce, and to create new services and innovations. We also need to assess whether our own legislation at European level is up-to-date in this sense, so that it really encourages data sharing. In particular, we also need to look at the data protection regulation here, because we often know that industrial data and personal data relating to individuals are linked. If there is even a small amount of personal data involved, then it is treated as personal data, and much of that opportunity may go untapped.'\n",

If we want to be competitive in the future, Europe must now invest specifically in three themes: firstly, research and development. As the report states, Member States should invest at least 3% of their GDP in research and development. This is far behind. In the recovery package, I expect the Member States to invest in this now. Secondly, we need a fast, modern digital infrastructure. We aim to have gigabit data and 5G across Europe. There is still a lot to do here. The third very important theme is the skills of people. As many as a third of the European workforce has digital skills shortages, and 70% of companies see it as a barrier to investment in Europe. This is a very serious situation. So we need to invest heavily in these three themes now to stay competitive. And, of course, we must ensure in all legislation that it encourages new innovation and investment in Europe. Especially when it comes to artificial intelligence, it is important to ensure that the rules that are otherwise valid in society also apply in the digital world, whether it is artificial intelligence or e-commerce.

    "rawdt = 'Dragoş Tudorache (Renew). – Madam President, dear Commissioner, I welcome the work on the digital future of Europe, of which the strategy for data is an important piece, but not the only one. The Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA), the digital decade, the Data Governance Act, the upcoming AI legislation are all ambitious and ground—breaking proposals. It is in this context of setting up our digital future that we need to remember that everything we do should be for the benefit of all citizens. And in light of this, I have three points to make. First, our citizens need to benefit from the personal data that they generate. We need to go beyond the GDPR and data protection, we need to find ways to make personal data generate value, not just for a few global tech platforms but also directly for all citizens. So looking forward to the Data Act, I encourage the Commission to reflect on such ways. Second, our citizens and our businesses need a single market, they need data economies of scale in order to take advantage of all that the digital age has to offer. This is one area where we cannot afford fragmentation. We need to do more at the European level, including in the way we write laws and we need to make sure that our data strategy leads to more convergence and better data flows in Europe. And third, in order to thrive, our citizens need additional protection against novel threats specific to the data economy. Fake news and disinformation, which threaten the foundations of our democracies, and other forms of data—fuelled hybrid threats can only be countered if we leverage our geopolitical weight and our strategic partnerships to set the global rules on how data can and cannot be used.'\n",
    "rawdt2 = 'Madam President, in a world where being connected has become as important as a fundamental right, the rise of social media has fundamentally transformed our society. The idols of our children are born on social media, we can be bullied or abused on social media, elections are lost or won on social media. Looking at the years ahead and the decisions facing us, I want to make three points. First, there is no online and offline world. There is only one world, one in which we must protect our citizens’ rights and our democracies in equal measure, both online and offline. The Digital Services Act (DSA) is a good step in this direction, and I commend the Commission for the level of ambition in the proposal. Second, social media has become a political tool for some, a tactical battlefield for others. Politicians, informal communities, structured organisations, and even states themselves, all embrace social media as the weapon of choice. But social media platforms are private companies so they alone do not have the incentive, the means or the legitimacy to take on politicians or state actors. They require democratic oversight and assistance for that, just as we require from them cooperation and compliance. So we are not adversaries, us and the platforms. We need to find together a burden-sharing equilibrium that guarantees both the common good and technological progress. My third point is that social media is global and geopolitical, so we need to use our entire diplomatic arsenal to protect our citizens’ rights and our way of life online. We need to work with the United States and other like-minded partners to define the rules of the future based on our shared values. And we need to use our dissuasion tools to address appropriately states such as Russia who use social media to sabotage our democracies and our common European project, or states such as China who work to build an alternative digital future without playing by the same rules or without relating to the same values.'\n",
    "rawdt3 = 'Mr President, in this Parliament we called for legislation on AI anchored in European values able to strengthen our digital single market. We now have a proposal on the table, the first of its kind in the world, and I thank and congratulate the Commission for it. We now need to work to ensure its success, and our mission is this: we need to secure the rights of all citizens and ensure AI does not lead to biases and discrimination. AI should be a force for good. We need to remove regulatory burdens to support innovation in our companies, big and small. AI should be a tool for prosperity and global competitiveness. We need to educate our citizens and train our specialists on AI. AI is as much about today as it is about the future. We need to ensure that Member States will implement this AI regulation in a manner that strengthens the digital single market and doesn’t fragment it. AI should bring the Union closer together. And we need to work with the US and other democracies to ensure AI is developed according to democratic values worldwide. AI is a geopolitical subject and the EU is a geopolitical actor. We have a historic opportunity to show global leadership. Let’s use it wisely.'\n",
    "rawdt4 = 'Mr President, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, the use of artificial intelligence in law enforcement is a political decision, not a technical one. Our duty is to apply our political worldview to determine what are the allowed uses of artificial intelligence and under which conditions. Europe is built on a set of values. They constrain the realm of the possible, dictating what we cannot do. And our values also guide our way into the future, dictating what we can and what we should do. What we cannot do is to allow the use of technology to lead to a breach of our values. We must only allow AI technologies to be used with straight safeguards and oversight, and we must ensure that human rights are protected throughout. What we also cannot do is to allow authorities to use technology for mass surveillance, mass social scoring or any type of government control over citizens. We must be doubly cautious in protecting our values when dealing with law enforcement, as law enforcement is the prerogative of the state. On the other hand, what we can – and should – do is to seek to use AI to reduce the biases and discriminations plaguing our society, including in law enforcement. Technology is a tool. We should invest in it until it is good enough to serve our values. What we also can and should do is ensure law enforcement is competitive and has the best tools at its disposal to fight crime. Fighting crime is also a way to protect our values and should be a top priority for us. We must therefore strengthen the democratic fibre and resilience of our institutions. And tomorrow’s challenges will not come from the tools themselves but from our ability or inability to use them in accordance with our values.'\n",
    "rawdt5 = 'Mr President, I was also in Washington last week as Chair of the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence in a Digital Age (AIDA) and with colleagues from across this aisle – an outreach mission, which we had wanted to do since the inception of the AIDA mandate. Our aim was to set the basis of a dialogue with the US Congress on artificial intelligence in the impact of frontier tech on the world of tomorrow. But the launch of the Trade and Technology Council (TTC) just weeks before opened up a broader perspective of transatlantic leadership on technology, on a shared realisation that the future of our relationship will be more and more dominated by tech cooperation, by what we will accomplish in converging standards, research, data governance and on developing mutually beneficial projects. And I congratulate the Commission for the launch and for how the TTC was organised. There are many commonalities at the heart TTC: common values, same challenges and opportunities, and most importantly, we see the geopolitics of technology in the same way. But there are also differences, which we need to acknowledge and learn to work with. We see the urgency in the form of regulating and digital platforms differently. We also have a different approach to how to prepare standards. We are more top-down while they work more bottom-up, co-creating together with the industry. We must accept these different regulatory cultures and in fact take the best from each other. I think we can and should work more with the business sector like the Americans do, while we can share with them the very good work that you the Commission has done in preparing the legislative landscape on digital issues. And most importantly, and we have made this point very forcefully, we must build a parliamentary dimension of the TTC, one where we can come together as legislators and exercise oversight and political guidance on the evolution of the council.'\n",

But today European companies don’t have the top-notch expertise to process big data and therefore we need huge investment in European talent, rather than outsourcing that task permanently to global hyperscalers that don’t respect our fundamental rights, like data protection. Secondly, we need to focus on innovation to minimise electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and waste, because the data economy must mitigate and not precipitate the climate crisis. And thirdly, we urgently need to close the gender-data gap in order to obtain high-quality data and create a digital economy in which all population groups are equally represented. Let’s respect privacy, focus on open source and decentralised systems, ensure intra-operability and above all, make sure that the produce of our new soil goes to the many and not the few.'\n",

Why is the opposite happening? Why are we seeing disinformation and hate speech thriving, fuelling extremism and violence, as we have all seen on Capitol Hill? The answer is easy. Because this information is circulating on giant private platforms whose only goal is maximising profit. And we are the raw material. Companies like Google and Facebook track every single step we take online and offline, and put micro-profiles and models that allow them to predict our behaviour. Those predictions are then sold to advertisers. This is where the revenue of those companies comes from: from us, from our behaviour. And the same micro-profiles allow the companies to keep us very effectively on their platforms, appealing to strong feelings like fear and hate and anger, which trigger us to interact longer, to share more, to generate more revenue. Hence the hate, hence the disinformation. And now some people think that we can solve the problem these companies have created by asking them to arbitrarily censor this harmful content themselves. That is not an option for democracy. But the good news is the remedy is easy. Let us ban the surveillance business model, starting with a ban on targeted advertising.

A single training cycle for a language processing model generates as much CO2 as 125 flights from New York to San Francisco. In order to make informed decisions like this and make the Green Deal a success, we need a standard to measure the environmental impact of digital technologies. The EU Commission urgently needs to come up with a proposal to ensure that digital technologies do not turn into coal, but into the sun of the future.'\n",

    "rawsh = 'Svenja Hahn (Renew). – Madam President! Thank you, Commissioner Reynders, for debating with us today. Data protection and cyber security are prerequisites for the secure, strategic handling of data. However, it is the quality, access and handling of them that will determine the success of data-driven technologies such as artificial intelligence. The data strategy must distinguish between personal, non-personal and anonymized data. Health data, for example, can be used anonymously very well and sensibly in research - but please not individually to calculate health insurance contributions. Incidentally, an algorithm can only ever be as good as the data it was fed with. Data records must be free of discrimination so that the application software, which has not yet heard from the woman in the management position, does not sort out the women. It also needs access to public data and clear rules about what companies have to share and what not, so that tomorrow it is not just those who already have a big data advantage today who are big. Because innovation and progress need data, and the future of artificial intelligence needs a smart European data strategy. After all, our goal is to lead the European Union to the top of the world in terms of innovation. And a data strategy is the cornerstone of that.'\n",
    "rawsh2 = 'Madam President! Authoritarian governments block or censor social media. Platforms delete content after unclear house rules or demands from governments. Regardless of whether it is due to politics or general terms and conditions: blocks need algorithms and artificial intelligence to recognize content. When we talk about the democratic regulation of social media, we also have to talk about it: Which tools do we allow and who is allowed to hold them? The decision about what is legal and what is illegal should not be left to companies. Upload filters and excessive deletion incentives endanger freedom of expression through overblocking. Artificial intelligence must give people opportunities instead of taking away their freedom. For this, a legal framework must look at the application, not at the technology itself. The planned regulation of artificial intelligence must protect our fundamental rights. Restricting freedom through technological progress would be the greatest step backwards for our society and a dangerous weapon in the hands of authoritarian regimes.'\n",
    "rawsh3 = 'Mister President! We have to strategically shape the digital transformation on a European basis, because progress and innovation do not just happen. Good ideas need investments and a political and social climate that encourages a new beginning. The Digital Europe program is the first pan-European digital program designed to shape this change. Public and private investments, education, research and the use of digital technologies are the drivers of progress. That is why I would have wished for more courage and financial clout. I find it more than regrettable that the Member States pushed through significant cuts in the negotiations. However, I am pleased that the focus is on research and the use of artificial intelligence. However, there is still room for improvement with the draft law by the Commission on the use of artificial intelligence. In particular, there must be no biometric mass surveillance of public space – without exception. So that good ideas and business models from Europe can actually become big, they need a common market. That is why the common digital single market must have absolute priority. The Digital Europe program is an important first step, because investments in digitization are investments in the future.

Ms Verheyen, your report makes important points from an educational and cultural point of view. However, these must fundamentally apply beyond these areas if we want to use the opportunities of artificial intelligence. Ethical principles and civil rights must be our guideline for the development and use of artificial intelligence. There must be no misuse of digital technologies, the protection of our fundamental rights is non-negotiable. This distinguishes us and must always distinguish us from authoritarian and totalitarian regimes. Artificial intelligence must always conform to fundamental rights. Seizing opportunities therefore also means excluding applications. That is why there needs to be a clear ban on general surveillance obligations such as upload filters or biometric surveillance in public spaces. Let us create a smart, sustainable and technology-open framework for artificial intelligence based on ethical principles and European core values!'\n",

I want us to put the EU at the forefront of innovation in the world. Above all, this means that we enable the potential of artificial intelligence to develop. First of all, we need fair competition between small and big players, between small and medium-sized companies and tech giants. This works with clear rules that make it easy for the start-up to expand and the requirements are based on size. We must encourage innovation instead of holding it back. This is possible if we remain open to technology and pursue a risk-based approach. Because the application and the corresponding risk belong in the focus. With face recognition as an example, we can see that quite nicely, it is handy for unlocking our phone, but biometric surveillance in public spaces is a threat to our civil liberties. As Europeans, we must shape digitization with self-confidence, but not alone. Independence must not become synonymous with protectionism. On the contrary: If we want to set value-based standards for the digital space, we have to do it together with democratic partners. Therefore: Let us start an AI alliance with the USA! I work for a digital space in Europe where the credo is a desire for progress, where start-ups can become global corporations and where there is fair competition.

That is why it is so important that the parliamentary proposal takes a clear position in favor of civil rights and against facial recognition. Human and civil rights are non-negotiable, especially when government agencies adopt new technologies. And I am not a bit surprised that it is again the conservative colleagues in the EPP who are pushing for biometric surveillance. With your amendments, you repeatedly put surveillance dreams – your surveillance dreams – above the protection of our fundamental rights for the umpteenth time. This vote is also a signal for the planned law on artificial intelligence, which importance the European Parliament attaches to our civil rights in the digital future.

What that means is that the same principles of human rights must be respected online as well as offline. In the past decade, we’ve observed the platformisation of the internet. Openness and free spirit have been consolidated into the monopoly of a few platforms. Therefore, the regulation of digital platforms has become even more important. However, the laws of physics online are different from those in the offline world. Therefore, we cannot simply apply regulation designed for the offline world online.

If we truly want her to follow her interests we need to start much earlier, already when kids are beginning their education in primary school – definitely much earlier than high school or college. Despite the fact that both boys and girls understand technology, there is a difference in the actual interest in technology that they allow themselves to show, because we raise girls and boys differently. Because it is not our gender, but our culture and society which determines what we find acceptable to show an interest in. We must allow our young girls to be interested in tech, just like we – from the cradle – promote cars, tools and tech to boys. In Denmark, in order to promote gender equality in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), Danish municipalities have created an ‘understanding technology’ class, as an elective course in elementary schools. However, in spite of the good intentions, on average these classes have only one girl – one girl – and usually because she likes the teacher, not because she is allowed to show an interest in technology. So we need to start early to allow girls all the way from kindergarten to university to take an interest in an education in tech.

    "rawvs = 'Virginijus Sinkevičius, Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I am truly grateful for the support for the digital Europe programme expressed by the European Parliament, not only during this debate but throughout the negotiations. I have taken very good note of your important comments today, from the importance of SMEs to the need to provide adequate training for the next generation, and from the urgency of addressing the challenges of cybersecurity to the potential offered by the twin transition towards a more digital and green Europe. Let me say once again that for the Commission, this programme is essential to deliver on the vision for the Digital Decade, on the twin green and digital transitions and on the digital sovereignty of the Union. As I mentioned in my introduction, we have mobilised unprecedented resources for the digital transition. The digital programme, underpinned by the national recovery and resilience plans, with 20% of funds reserved for digital, will play a catalytic role. This is a historic opportunity for all Member States and for all of us. We have to address gaps in the identified critical capacities and critical technologies and support an interconnected, interoperable and secure single market. Next week, the Commission will present an update of our industrial strategy with an assessment of our strategic dependences. The digital Europe programme will be a central point of gravity for developing key digital projects across the single market and an important source of funding. I believe we are fully equipped and ready to engage in this Digital Decade journey and to start this ambitious digital Europe programme.'\n",
    "rawvs2 = 'Member of the Commission. – Mr President, it’s my pleasure to be here today. This debate could not come at a better time. A little more than a month ago, the Commission presented Europe’s Digital Decade – a vision, targets and avenues for a successful digital transformation of Europe by 2030 in a direction that benefits all our citizens and businesses. It sets the course towards a digitally—empowered Europe by 2030 and provides for a digital compass to guide us there. The ambition is to pursue digital policies that empower people and businesses to seize a human—centred, sustainable and more prosperous digital future. This required setting the right regulatory framework for the digital space, and we are working closely with the Parliament on this, but also accelerating investments in our digital capabilities. The Digital Europe Programme will be one of the core EU instruments to achieve the Digital Decade. Let me underline that it will be the first ever EU programme entirely dedicated to digital. Here I would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Mr Flego, and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), as well as the shadow rapporteurs and all the associated committees. Your support in the negotiations and swift political agreement on digital Europe shows that we are all working together on shaping and supporting the digital transformation of Europe’s society and economy. The COVID crisis has demonstrated how crucial digital technologies and skills are for all of us to work, to study and to do business across our single market. The pandemic has also exposed Europe’s vulnerabilities and where we need to get better. It has only accentuated the need for a programme such as digital Europe that will enable us today to deploy digital capacities and strengthen our resilience. It will fill the deployment gap in digital technologies to make sure that the fruits of research and innovation investment get successfully deployed throughout Europe and benefit all our businesses, notably SMEs. Digital Europe will provide funding for projects in five crucial areas: supercomputing, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, advanced digital skills and ensuring the wide use of digital technologies across the economy and society. These investments will support the Union’s twin objectives of a green transition and digital transformation and strengthen the Union’s resilience. The Digital Europe Programme is thus one of the key tools to make sure that the digital transition will propel the recovery. With the new EU budget and with the Recovery and Resilience Facility and its 20% target for digital, we have mobilised unprecedented resources to invest in digital transition. This marks a key opportunity for Europe to strengthen its digital capacities and deliver the Digital Decade targets by 2030. We know we now have our digital compass and resources to get us there.'\n",

    "rawkvs = 'Kim Van Sparrentak, rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. – Mr President, this week in the Netherlands secondary schools have started their final exams, which is an important moment in their lives and for their future. Last year, in the UK, not exams but artificial intelligence determined A-level exam results, which resulted in arbitrary and discriminatory results. Kids who went to an expensive private school were systematically marked up and kids from state schools were systematically given a lower grade than expected. We need to protect pupils and students against situations where a computer or algorithm decides their future without human oversight. But we also have to protect them from companies harvesting their personal data through educational software. In the Netherlands, 70% of all primary schools are now Google schools, which is increasingly raising privacy concerns. For crucial digital infrastructure, like our education systems, we must not be dependent on a small number of large companies. We need public investment in education technology, clear public procurement rules and always human oversight on all decisions about the future of pupils and students.'\n",
    "rawkvs2 = 'Madam President, whether you are a political activist, drag queen or the President of the United States, if we let private companies like Twitter and Facebook decide if you can speak freely, we are endangering our democratic society. These same big corporations who have profited for years from the large—scale spread of misinformation are now acting as referees of our public debates. Let me be clear: incentivising platforms to delete even more is not the solution. This only reinforces their current power over our free speech. We have to tackle the root causes. A small number of very large and powerful platforms are controlling our public debate and amplifying fake news and hate on a large scale, specifically targeting certain people for profit. Let’s be ambitious in tackling this in the DSA and DMA. Who can say what, where and when should not be up to CEOs and shareholders. Not private companies but our democratic laws should determine the boundaries of our freedoms. Not big tech but judges should decide what is illegal or not. We need to take the power over our freedom of expression out of the hands of private companies and place it firmly back in the hands of the people and our democratic institutions.'\n",
    "rawkvs3 = 'Mr President, this report was supposed to address how we shape our digital future and improve the use of AI for consumers, but unfortunately it fails to truly address some of the core issues we see with the use of AI. Internet users are manipulated on a daily basis. Algorithms decide what we get to see online based on clicks, manipulation and micro—targeting. ‘Likes’, notifications and ‘nudges’ manipulate users into certain behaviour like staying on a platform for longer, watching extreme content or buying items they don’t need. It can even lead to addiction. This report does not even mention the manipulation of consumers we witness online today, and even though the ample opinion clearly pointed out the health and safety dangers of being constantly monitored and tracked real—time at work, the report lacks any reference to surveillance of workers or exploitation by algorithmic management. It simply fails to protect the rights of workers. We cannot ignore these crucial issues when we shape our digital future. And then, this report only contains weak texts on transparency and human oversight and vague texts on avoiding prohibited discrimination. We, as legislators, have the responsibility not just to avoid, but to ensure, that everyone is protected against discrimination by AI and that fundamental rights are protected at all times. Looking at previous parliamentary positions, this text is an unnecessary step back. We, as the European Parliament, need to step up our game, because empty promises will not actually protect European consumers, workers or citizens. Clear rules and rights will.'\n",

Imagine waking up one day with the police barging into your house after AI has flagged you as a suspect. Then it’s up to you to prove your innocence. It is you versus the computer. And the myth that a calculation is more ethical than a human is dangerous, especially where decisions impact people’s lives. So to my colleagues from the EPP: let’s be realistic. AI is not a quick solution to fight crime or terrorism. An AI camera will not detect radicalisation, and automating police work is not a substitute for police funding and community workers. Looking at the US, in New York City and Boston, replacing AI-driven predictive policing with community policing lowered crime rates. And San Francisco and Boston have already banned biometric surveillance in public spaces. So not only is a ban perfectly feasible, we in the EU are far behind in our ethical AI choices. And if we as Parliament are serious about making the EU a leader in ethical AI and fundamental human rights, let’s ban biometric surveillance in public spaces.'\n",

    "rawad = 'Angel Djambazki, rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - Mr President, Commissioner Gabriel, artificial intelligence and its application are becoming more common in various areas of our lives, such as defense. We have witnessed the complete transition of activities from our daily lives in absentia, online. The same happened in the field of education, which showed a significant problem that needs to be addressed. 42% of the population of the European Union do not have basic digital skills. I believe that teachers cannot and should not be replaced by machines and programs, in the foreseeable future at least, but funds must be set aside for their qualification, for working with artificial intelligence, interactive teaching. Artificial intelligence also plays a role in spreading fake news. It is important to be able to counteract and use it to combat misinformation. I do not think it should be unattended and without people, because more than once the use of algorithms from major social networks and online platforms leads to downloads, blocking content that is pure censorship. And this is a serious part, for which I thank and congratulate the rapporteur. However, there is a very frivolous part, and I admit, I am impressed, even in this report, when it comes to artificial intelligence, you managed to include your favorite topics such as gender propaganda, LGBT and gender, gender, equality, etc. Even the poor robots in the future will have to comply with this propaganda, which makes their future quite sad, I think, but what to do is the option in which we live.'\n",

To most Europeans with a little common sense, one thing is crystal clear: this House does not care about free speech. We did not see a reaction from the European Parliament when tech giants removed President Trump from their networks in January. We did not see a reaction when Parler was removed from all major app stores. We did not see a reaction when Vox activists were brutally attacked in Barcelona last weekend. Yes, there is pure censorship now in Europe: in Spain, against the only right-wing, traditional, national, conservative political party – Vox. This is provided by Twitter, for example. We didn’t see a reaction when this House promoted fake news about so-called ‘LGBTI—free zones’ in Poland. On the contrary, this European Parliament promoted such false information. The fact of the matter is that this House does not permit opposing views which attack the liberal consensus. The new politburo will not tolerate diverging opinions which don’t accept the agenda of the day. The liberal establishment does not accept views against illegal migration, against NGOs helping human trafficking in the Mediterranean Sea, against the LGBTI ideology and propaganda, or against federalism. The USSR had a one-party system. This European Parliament has a multi-party system, where political parties don’t really matter. Nothing. The majority of this House takes the same stance on the issues I mentioned. But do not worry, please. Freedom will always find a way, and liberty will always win.

As I have already pointed out in the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, artificial intelligence and related technologies would have many benefits in reducing crime, combating trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation of children, data analysis, and so on. But even when we have to commend them, colleagues, we come to paragraph 9. He emphasizes that many of the algorithm-based identification technologies currently used make a disproportionate number of errors in identification and classification, thus harming people who are disadvantaged by racism, people belonging to certain ethnic communities, LGBTI and so on and so forth. Colleagues, do any of you assume that artificial intelligence is a racist, misogynist and a person who hates LGBTI? I have often heard in this Chamber that some people from outside spoke out against this Union and tried to destroy it. No, colleagues, this is not necessary!

However, only if we eliminate the risks will these changes be positive. For instance, AI systems evaluating applications for universities must be considered high risk. Imagine that a technology faculty employs such a system and uses graduates’ profiles for machine learning. Women are under-represented in technology, so the system may reject applications from women, based on that pattern, and such discrimination is unacceptable. Systems with such an impact on people’s lives must be verifiable at every stage of their life cycle by authorities and by civil society. Let me remind you that free and open source solutions serve this purpose best. We also need to update curricula so that students are prepared to fully participate in the digital society and to understand how AI systems may influence their decisions, shopping patterns or what they see online. And finally, my Group has also been calling for a ban on facial recognition technologies in public space. Among other things, they can be easily abused to persecute investigative journalists.

Recent events in the United States demonstrated that large platforms, due to their size, have a systemic role in amplifying and shaping information flows and create parallel information bubbles. With the new Digital Markets Act, we need to enable an environment where people can not only scrutinise if they are being targeted by malicious actors via the platform, but also gain back effective control, where they have a choice to switch to an alternative, decentralised, open and privacy-friendly service. Only in this case can democratic scrutiny and the protection of fundamental rights have full effect.'\n",

A frictionless single market, where companies of all sizes and in any sector can compete on equal terms. The Parliament had the opportunity to suggest improvements to this digital strategy. However, we missed the opportunity to make a meaningful change. Innovation can’t be a goal in itself. Public services should remain truly public services without artificial competitive pressure. Data protection must not be undermined by trade agreements. SMEs and other economic actors should benefit from cooperative business models such as free and open source software.

Just last night, thanks to work by 600 journalists worldwide, we learned about tax avoidance and money laundering committed by billionaires and high profile-politicians. For instance, we learned that Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš used offshore companies to buy a castle in France. With mass surveillance, journalists cannot possibly do their work safely. Two journalists were murdered in the Union just this year. With facial recognition in public space, oligarchs would have even more tools in their hands to persecute and oppress journalists.

As you can see, the use of artificial intelligence in the education, cultural and creative sectors presents many opportunities, but also challenges. We want to preserve the European cultural diversity in the rapidly changing environment of today. We therefore want to ensure that the great diversity of European cultural and creative players can benefit from these developments. To explore the possibilities, the Commission has launched a study which will identify inspiring case studies for all creative sectors; results are expected in December. As for the challenges, your report rightly highlights, among others, the importance of protecting privacy, combating discrimination, promoting gender equality, respecting human rights intellectual property, environmental protection, and consumer rights. All of these challenges are being examined through various ongoing initiatives and studies. Creative Europe also recognizes these challenges and encourages collaboration between the culture and media sectors to address these challenges, through its newly created cross-sector innovation lab. I would like to end on a subject that I find particularly important. We must ensure that these technological developments do not change our values ​​and our European way of life. Progress without inclusion and equality, dissemination of news or data without ethics are just empty words. We need to ensure that no one will be left behind, that no one will feel their privacy or rights have been violated, and that everyone will have an equal opportunity to thrive. After four councils in recent days and four debates this evening, I would like to thank you once again for the extraordinary energy I felt this evening, and also tell you that you can count on my support.'\n",
    "rawmg2 = 'Mr President, ladies and gentlemen Members of the European Parliament, allow me first of all to thank the rapporteur Sabine Verheyen, chair of the Committee on Culture and Education, and the whole of this committee for this report and for highlighting the importance of artificial intelligence in education, culture and the audiovisual sector. The European Parliament and the European Commission fully recognize the strategic importance of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies for the Union. Artificial intelligence is already transforming our lives and it will continue to have an increasing impact on the way we learn, work and enjoy our free time. However, this change is not without risk. Artificial intelligence technologies are increasingly being used to spread fake news, distort reality, hijack data or even marginalize groups of people. Now is the time to seize the opportunities and meet the challenges. It is time for adaptation and this is precisely where education comes in. Education can help and add a bridge between technological advances and the training needed to use them safely, effectively and ethically. The action plan for digital education exploits the possibilities offered by technologies such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality or robotics. The goal is to scale up successful practices and better understand the ethical, privacy and security implications. It will offer targeted funding and support measures and act as a catalyst to promote a strategic approach to digital education in the Union. Through this plan, we are strengthening digital skills and developing guidelines that will help our Member States support educators, learners, researchers and future innovators, and thus contribute to the development of a successful digital education ecosystem. . For example, we will prepare ethical guidelines on artificial intelligence and the use of data in teaching and learning. I would like to tell you that at this very moment, the call for experts who will form this group has been launched since April 23. The idea is that they start their work next month, that is to say in June, and to have a first report by the end of this year. Similar guidelines on digital literacy and disinformation will also be developed, to tackle the spread of fake news and disinformation online. Raising awareness is equally important, which is why after the publication of the guidelines, the Commission will support awareness-raising activities aimed at educators and students. At the same time, we are updating the digital skills framework of the action plan, adding artificial intelligence and data skills. This framework defines the skills required for citizens who are digitally competent in the 21st century. Finally, we also support research and innovation in artificial intelligence in education. We have started to explore the use of artificial intelligence and learning analytics in education to support the education system to meet skills needs and trends. Two online artificial intelligence services are being developed right now. However, as highlighted in your report, the impact of digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence, goes far beyond the education and training sector. They also have an impact on the cultural and creative sectors, as well as on the heritage sector. An obvious example is the issue of the control of online streaming services by artificial intelligence, which is mentioned in your report and which generated a lot of interest during a recent online conference entitled \"Diversity and competitiveness of the European sector music\", which my services organized with experts from the Member States and representatives of the sector. Streaming will fundamentally change the way music reaches consumers. It can create opportunities to build diversity, but it can also favor some artists, languages ​​or genres over others. It is therefore essential to ensure greater transparency in the use of algorithms by streaming services, and fair financial compensation for creators and rights holders. At the same time, digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence, offer new possibilities to make cultural heritage more accessible to all audiences, and also to preserve cultural content. The crisis has also made clearer than ever the need to strengthen the link between digitization, heritage and education as digital possibilities make learning about heritage more accessible. A good example is the Europeana platform, which was able to reach nearly 50,000 schoolchildren with online courses and new platforms during the pandemic. We are also exploring the relationship between digital technologies and cultural heritage, through the Commissionary expert group on cultural heritage, which meets in April to inform Member State representatives of the possibilities offered by the application of artificial intelligence to cultural heritage. With regard to research and innovation, the new project of the program \"Horizon Europe\" includes a new fully dedicated culture cluster, which will at this time support culture and inclusive society and which will help the fields of culture and cultural heritage to benefit from projects dealing with the economic and social impact of technological applications and digital services linked to the evolution of the sector. Finally and lastly, technology also has potential to promote the concept of sustainable cultural tourism. The working group of European experts on sustainable cultural tourism, within the framework of the open method of coordination and in the context of previous work plans for culture, has published a report which includes the first definition of sustainable cultural tourism , as well as recommendations and guidelines for policy makers. I think it is first up to us to see how all these elements can truly serve the recommendations in the report, for which I thank you once again from the bottom of my heart.'\n",

The solution is a risk-based control approach that focuses on high-risk applications. Let us define them now without harming European competitiveness. Let us inspire, not hinder! We create user trust with transparency rules. Everyone should know when they are dealing with AI, for example on the phone. And we also invest: from Digital Europe and Horizon Europe, one billion euros a year in artificial intelligence, hopefully to trigger up to 20 billion euros in additional investment from private individuals and the member states. A further 134 billion euros will come from the RRF of the reconstruction fund for digitization - this will be a turning point in our quest for technology leadership. Now we have to develop the applications of tomorrow for this. This also requires playgrounds for experimenting, such as the sandbox environments.

Solutions based on advanced algorithms and using the possibilities of artificial intelligence will play a key role in the modernization of the European transport system. This applies not only to transport automation, but also to the creation of intelligent traffic management systems in cities and solutions improving the safety of vehicles and drivers. Without harnessing the potential of the digital revolution, it will be virtually impossible to meet the Vision Zero goals. One of the key barriers to the practical implementation of AI technologies in the transport sector is the lack of clear and consistent rules for determining the division of responsibility in the event of a breakdown or accident, as well as ensuring the appropriate level of cybersecurity for the vehicles and infrastructure communicating with each other. We must place particular emphasis on this issue in the work on the regulation on artificial intelligence. To create innovative products and services in the transport and tourism sectors, European companies need huge amounts of digital data. We should create a system of incentives for Member States to freely and free of charge make public data available, including data falling within the scope of the spatial information infrastructure, such as geodetic and cartographic data.

    "rawsv2 = 'Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues! First of all, even at this late hour, I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs, the secretariat, and the staff for the good working relationship, cooperation and support. Through this cooperation I think a good comprehensive report was possible. We wrote a report on artificial intelligence in the fields of education, culture and audiovisual media. In this report, we call for a clear ethical framework for the use of AI technology in media to ensure people have access to culturally and linguistically diverse content. Such a framework should also address the misuse of artificial intelligence to spread fake news and disinformation. We need clear rules for AI technologies so that they protect anti-discrimination, gender equality, pluralism and cultural and linguistic diversity. The use of data that reflects existing inequality or discrimination should be excluded when training artificial intelligence. Instead, an inclusive and ethical framework should be developed for the use of datasets that are applied during the deep learning process. There is no doubt that artificial intelligence technologies will encounter us in all areas of life in the future and will certainly also enrich them. However, we must put people at the center of the use of all technology, and especially in the field of education, artificial intelligence technology must be geared towards the human being, who makes the final decision and holds the responsibility in his hands. Nevertheless, I think it is wrong to generally classify the education sector as a high-risk sector in the discussion about artificial intelligence. In the education sector in particular, there are all conceivable ways in which AI can be used. Some carry higher risks, others far lower. Here, however, a clear risk assessment is required and not a generalization of an entire sector in order to be able to classify regulation and security measures depending on the actual current risk. At this point I would also like to remind you of the importance of strengthening digital skills at Union level as a prerequisite for the use of artificial intelligence in education and of the need, above all, to train teachers so that they can adapt to the realities of AI-based Education can adapt and risks from misuse of technology can be reduced. Teachers must always be able to correct decisions made by the AI, such as when grading students. Teachers must never be replaced by AI technologies, and especially not in early childhood education. For the cultural and creative sectors, we call for a coherent vision of the use of artificial intelligence at European level and in the Member States. Algorithm-based content recommendations, especially for video and music streaming services, should not be able to negatively impact cultural and linguistic diversity in the European Union. To this end, specific indicators will be developed to assess diversity and ensure that European works are promoted. In this way, we want to reduce filter bubbles and enable more transparency for consumers, who can then better understand algorithm decisions. We have fought for decades to establish our values ​​of inclusion, non-discrimination, multilingualism and cultural diversity, which our citizens see as an essential part of European identity. These values ​​must also be reflected in the online world, in which algorithms and artificial intelligence applications are increasingly being used. Maximum transparency and the development of high-quality and inclusive data systems for the deployment of deep learning are crucial, as is a clear ethical framework to ensure access to culturally and linguistically diverse content. Artificial intelligence is a technology that influences many areas of our lives and is a key driver of digital change. In my opinion, one thing is certain: Ultimately, technology must serve people. The human being is the focus and has the responsibility as well as the control and the final decision.'\n",

A functioning digital internal market is key to supporting SMEs in their digital transformation.

Fundamental is the obligation to inform the consumer that he is interacting with an artificial intelligence system; this will promote consumer protection and lead them to feel more protected, increasing trust in these systems. Trust increases if you feel you are being protected. The attention dedicated to people with disabilities is also good, with the call to implement the European act on accessibility without delay to ensure effective inclusion. One fundamental point remains: guaranteeing effective human control over the decision-making process, because we cannot be dominated by machines.

We need to complete it, especially in the area of ​​services, and we need to build a common digital market, because it was the pandemic that showed the importance of digitalisation. It permeates every area of ​​our lives. In Europe, we need to create the conditions to maintain a healthy business environment while protecting consumers from new threats. Support for the development of innovation and research, also through the Recovery Fund or the Horizon program, will certainly play a key role in future success. Innovative small and medium-sized enterprises must have sufficient access to free capital and we must not burden them with additional bureaucracy. We need to strengthen the protection of intellectual property and patents against unfair practices. On the other hand, we need to keep in mind rights and consumer protection. It is consumer protection that is our next important privilege, and in this regard I also welcome the new program for consumers from the European Commission. It is consumers who must be the driving force behind the transformation to a digital sustainable environment. The use of artificial intelligence also has great potential in consumer protection, for example in the still current topic of dual product quality. Any such use must be human-centered and life-enhancing. I would also like to thank my colleague, Deirdre Clune, for very good news.'\n",

We need to improve not only digital infrastructure, but also to invest more in digital skills and ensure a clear and stable legal framework. We use new digital technologies every day. Even if we do not realize it, they can sometimes be a threat, but especially an opportunity. The proposed balanced and systematic regulation can be an investment with a very fast return. New technologies bring great potential for economic growth, creating millions of new jobs, saving lives in healthcare, but also simplifying our way of life. Within the Digital Europe program, I appreciate the emphasis on the importance of educating the new generation and retraining the current workforce.

Model focused on the person, rights, consumer protection, especially the most vulnerable, but without forgetting the support for innovation and small and medium-sized enterprises, which today are seeing a glimmer of light, after the pandemic, and need to both legislative and resource support. We need to give legal certainty and a level playing field for everyone, making it clear that what is illegal offline must also be illegal online, and ensuring fair conditions for taxation in the digital economy. We appreciate that the Commission has taken into account many of the requests by the Parliament in the proposal on artificial intelligence, including the prohibition of some uses and the tight regulation of others. We are now ready to improve some aspects of it, in particular with regard to fundamental rights and freedoms, to guarantee artificial intelligence systems at the service of the person, so that citizens and consumers can use it with confidence to improve their lives.'\n",

A power that calls into question the founding values ​​of our societies: democracy, pluralism, freedom of expression and privacy. All this is the consequence of years of practices that have favored manipulation of users for profit reasons, highlighting content based on views, and reinforcing the prejudices of each thanks to an extreme proliferation through data. The right to have your own expression expanded through the payment to have more visibility of your own contents is a false right. And we have seen scandals like Cambridge Analytica. And then it can no longer be postponed. By respecting net neutrality and freedom of expression, we must take absolute power away from social networks. We need to put a stop to harmful practices and therefore we need a new constitution in the digital field which finds in the proposals of the regulation on digital services and markets a fundamental piece on which to build.'\n",
    "rawbb3 = 'Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Parliament prepares to examine the proposal for a regulation on artificial intelligence, with this report we are giving a clear message and we are already setting an important point: in Europe, in our opinion, there is no room for mass biometric surveillance and security and the fight against crime cannot take place at the expense of the fundamental rights of citizens. In fact, identification by means of biometric data in places accessible to the public risks serious abuses on the right to privacy and on other principles underlying our democratic systems. The European Privacy Guarantor said so: these systems would have a direct negative impact on the exercise of freedom of expression, assembly, association, up to the very freedom of movement. Then let us think about what could happen in places not so attentive to the separation of powers or fundamental freedoms, be they states or cities. The risk of abuse is too great. This is why we believe that the exceptions to Article 5 on prohibited practices of the proposed regulation should be removed. Likewise, predictive techniques for law enforcement carry with them a very serious risk of discrimination, in addition to the lack of evidence on their accuracy, undermining one of the fundamental foundations of our democratic systems, namely the presumption of innocence. No human supervision nor error-free datasets will be sufficient to ensure that decisions of this kind by artificial intelligence systems are made respecting constitutional guarantees and fundamental rights of the Union, even where these decision-making processes are reversible. All the more reason these systems cannot be subjected to a mere self-assessment of conformity before being placed on the market, as proposed by the regulation in its first draft under our examination. In fact, a self-assessment exposes to unacceptable risks of errors and violations, which would be discovered only later by the supervisory authorities if they have the means to do so, and this would happen to damage that has now occurred, even irreparable, for the lives of people. In the Union, we already have the most advanced laws in the world on the protection of personal data. For us it is a model, a model that we want to bring to the rest of the world, and we cannot afford to move back even one millimeter from this approach when we find ourselves regulating artificial intelligence. In this area too, we must fully protect the rights of citizens. I think this is the way we can act for a Europe that has its own human rights-centered model of artificial intelligence.'\n",

    "rawms = 'Margaritis Schinas, Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, Madam Rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for this impressive work and for this timely report. The pandemic has only confirmed the importance of working on digital priority, including artificial intelligence; but the pandemic is not over and I am confident that the momentum towards digitization will continue. Europe is in a unique position to develop and use advanced digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence, big data and the Internet of Things, in an ambitious, innovative and sustainable way. The widespread integration of these digital technologies is essential for European economic recovery. Our duty as European policymakers is to facilitate and help accelerate this process. This means removing barriers to the digital single market, empowering people to use a new generation of technologies to serve them, and addressing strategic weaknesses in our digital infrastructures. We in the Commission are determined to make the 2020s digital decade of Europe. We want to drive digital policies that empower people and businesses and lead to a sustainable and prosperous digital future. This European digital decade must be based on four cardinal points: talent, infrastructure, business transformation and the digitization of public administrations. For each of these four areas, we also propose clear quantified objectives to be achieved by 2030, as well as concrete actions, including for SMEs and start-ups. After listening to stakeholders, the Commission will propose a digital policy program and a solemn declaration of digital principles. We are of course counting on the support and commitment of this house to achieve this ambition. To foster digital transformation, the Commission has already proposed important legislative initiatives which are on your table, such as the digital services legislation, the digital market legislation, a new European cybersecurity strategy and the act on data governance. She also noted that artificial intelligence can strategically and crucially contribute to these goals. The key to unlocking the benefits of all this data will be processing it through artificial intelligence systems that we will be proposing in a new legislative initiative, the Data Act, later this year. Here again, I observe that we essentially share the same concerns. Your report also underlines that we must find a way to protect European values, security, fundamental rights and our European way of life, but without jeopardizing our potential for innovation. You also stress on several occasions the importance of taking into account the needs of SMEs. The deployment of AI by large companies alone would effectively deprive us in Europe of most of the advantages linked to these technologies. The artificial intelligence package that we just proposed on April 21 reflects exactly this dual approach, which consists of developing the potential of artificial intelligence while tackling the problems that these technologies can cause. The proposed AI regulation is built so that all Europeans can have confidence in the anthropocentric management of artificial intelligence. Proportional and flexible rules are proposed to address the specific risks posed by AI systems in certain contexts. We also foresee a technologically neutral and evolutionary definition of the notion of AI, insofar as it can also cover techniques and approaches that are not yet known or developed. It also prohibits the use of particularly risky artificial intelligence technologies, such as social rating. For the rest, it is based on a risk-related approach, since it focuses on so-called high-risk AI use cases. Only these cases must meet a set of requirements specifically designed to enhance transparency and minimize risks to security and our fundamental rights. The coordinated plan published together with the proposal for a regulation describes the policies and investments needed at European level to establish European pre-eminence in this area. We aim to encourage investment from Member States and stimulate private investment, to gradually increase all public and private investment in the field of artificial intelligence to 20 billion euros per year from here at the end of the decade. The Commission will invest around EUR 1 billion per year in this area, in the context of the Horizon Europe and Digital Europe programs for the budgetary period of the next seven years, but without counting the investments on the cohesion policy program , which will be added to this sum. These investments aim to support research, innovation, testing, experimentation, skills development and the use of AI for SMEs. Europe has research excellence, a vibrant robotics community and successful industrial sectors. Together, they contribute to European excellence in artificial intelligence and help us to take advantage of the advantages these technologies offer us. Finally, we have included measures on artificial intelligence in the field of health and on the development of green intelligence. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to conclude by emphasizing the constructive role that this Parliament has played, and will continue to play, in advancing this ambitious European programme. Allow me also to conclude by thanking you once again for your impressive work and by further emphasizing how convergent and compatible our approaches are.'\n",

It presents big benefits, but it may also have drawbacks, and some of those you have mentioned, like fundamental rights, impact on safety and certain black-box artificial intelligence applications are complex and opaque, which can be a challenge. Our proposals will have to ensure that high-risk AI systems are designed in a way that is compliant with fundamental rights and safety standards. In Europe, algorithms will not be in the hands of software engineers. Algorithms will be in the hands of society. Compliance with the requirements that have been proposed will minimise the risk of harm and ensure that any possible breaches can be investigated and addressed. Let me recall that we are not regulating the technology but its use in certain contexts, and this is a proportionate approach and one that creates a level playing field for European and non-European companies alike. The Commission will also come forward with a proposal on liability towards the end of the year. Let me conclude by saying once again that I don’t think that there has to be a trade-off in Europe between fundamental rights and supporting innovation when we discuss artificial intelligence. The two are compatible and together we can make sure that the balance is right. I will be counting on this House to bring these proposals and reinforce this balance further.'\n",

    "rawigdb = 'Iban Garcia Del Blanco (S&D). – Mr President, I would like, first of all, to thank and congratulate the rapporteur for his report, which I believe is absolutely balanced and is in line with what this Parliament has already proposed on several occasions. We have to find, indeed, a balance between the risk for the protection of rights and, of course, the technological development that facilitates us in some way the achievement of objectives of a social nature. But we are, yes, before an issue that directly affects fundamental rights. Several of them are involved in the legal development of this technology, or in the legal field that orders this technology, and, at the same time, social peace is also at stake when we talk about issues that affect security and the established order itself and the rules by which we abide. It is a question that, indeed, some of those realities that science fiction has anticipated in the past - some of them are already a reality today in terms of technological development - do not become a kind of dystopia in our times of those approaches from films such as Minority Report, where the police even anticipate the commission of the crime or the manifested intention because they are capable of foreseeing the possible commission of a crime through technologies such as these; or, without going any further, that one day we will have those robot judges that in some way would also have delighted some French revolutionaries when they said that \"the mouth that says the law\", seeking an alleged impartiality in the expression of justice from town. But, at the same time, we also have to avoid obstacles to the development of tools that can effectively help us achieve some of the objectives that can make our societies better; Of course, in the field of the administration of justice itself, but also as a support tool for our own security forces. We cannot ignore those possibilities that artificial intelligence gives and hinder its development. That is why I also want to support this report, which I believe fits perfectly - and this is something I would like to remind some of my colleagues - into the approach that this very Parliament approved almost a year ago - a matter on which I was rapporteur, moreover —, which spoke of ethics applied to artificial intelligence technologies and that I think went in the same direction, trying to avoid scenarios that are not desirable, but also trying at the same time not to get in the way. Ladies and gentlemen, this report cannot completely open the barriers and let everyone go their own way and, at the same time, be as intrusive as other colleagues denounce. I think that this is precisely a report that finds the middle ground, that raises very interesting questions.'\n",

In the same way, speaking of the culture and audiovisual sector, the implication that the use of these techniques has, the change in that ecosystem, may be so great that it is appropriate that we make a second more specific reading in this sector, and that This is what also mandates this report in some way, and it is an aspect that I want to highlight. And lastly, we have digital literacy: it is not just about having digital skills, it is about deeply understanding what this phenomenon implies, and, therefore, I also want to highlight the need we have to introduce that understanding of change in education. of which we are simply already observing its maximum dimension.'\n",

Whether they like it or not, the platforms are acknowledging their responsibility for the content, also when they make mistakes and when they exceed it, and this is a good starting point for their regulation, including redress. We have to provide the platforms with legal instruments so that they can carry out what we ask of them: collaboration and compliance with obligations to detect, notify and eliminate illegal content, from terrorism and sexual abuse of minors to disinformation and hate speech. But freedom of expression has to be respected and defended as a whole, and I think it is timely to remember this so that the demand for freedom of expression is not hijacked by the extremisms that are also present in this House, because these extremisms, while demanding respect for them, they harass uncomfortable journalists, single them out, prevent their access to press conferences, organize discrediting campaigns against the media or directly promote boycotts to harm their dissemination.

Let us think of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, the proliferation of terrorist content online, the trafficking of human beings by immigration mafias or for purposes of sexual or labor exploitation, or the proliferation of sexual abuse of minors, which require work to identify the victims and the perpetrators and the places where the abuses have been committed, and which test the psychological resistance of those who have to carry out this identification work. It is true that the algorithms have to improve and that their risks require surrounding their use with great safeguards. But I am not in favor of absolute prohibitions, but of guarantees such as those that the amendments presented by my group establish in relation to prior judicial authorization. We have to offer an environment that facilitates the development of artificial intelligence, also in those areas that can be classified as \"high risk\", with due guarantees.

However, if it is not properly regulated, artificial intelligence can threaten the privacy of an individual and lead to various forms of discrimination. Therefore, it is not surprising that as many as 88 percent of citizens believe that it should be managed carefully. The fight against sophisticated, well-funded and equipped terrorist and criminal groups in the 21st century cannot be imagined without the use of artificial intelligence. On the other hand, the example of artificial intelligence is particularly sensitive in the field of criminal law because it includes the possibility of geometric recognition and algorithmic decision making. In order to protect citizens from its abuse, but also to become a world leader in smart technologies, the European Union needs a new, comprehensive approach to artificial intelligence. Such an approach should ban the concept of social valuation, which can be used to collect a wide range of data on citizens and their behavior using algorithms. On the other hand, the use of biometric identification systems in public places for law enforcement purposes in accordance with the principle of proportionality should be limited to situations such as searching for a missing child, preventing a specific and imminent terrorist threat and detecting, locating, identifying or investigating against the perpetrator of a serious criminal offense or a suspect for such an offense. We need to strike a balance between using artificial intelligence to catch criminals on the one hand and protecting human rights on the other, but without spreading hysteria and paranoia, which we are unfortunately witnessing here today.'\n",

Still, 88 percent say it needs to be managed carefully. While we are discussing this important topic in Croatia, not far from Zagreb, the construction of one of the most advanced technological campuses is beginning, in which, among other things, the technology of autonomous vehicles based on artificial intelligence will be developed. Such examples show that the use of artificial intelligence represents the future of the European economy and that it will become a common, integral part of technologically advanced production in the coming decades. That is why I emphasize that comprehensive European rules on artificial intelligence are needed in order to encourage growth and development and remove obstacles to business, and on the other hand to maximally protect the interests of consumers, especially their security and privacy. Also, let me point out in particular the potential that artificial intelligence has in the field of healthcare. As many as half of our citizens believe that the health sector is the one in which artificial intelligence can realize its greatest potential. That this is indeed the case is evidenced by recent research showing that artificial intelligence algorithms identify breast cancer with approximately 90 percent accuracy in combination with the analysis of radiologists. In the circumstances in which we have made the fight against cancer our priority, I call on the European institutions to continue to strongly support the development of artificial intelligence, as it provides an early diagnosis of malignant diseases and thus gives patients hope for successful cure.'\n",

We talk about democratic control of social networks, but the first space is that of those of us who hold public office, and very especially of people with government responsibilities. Encouraging ideological hostility from governments is the most serious game: we have seen it in the United States, in Russia, in Hungary, in the Catalan region; We know it with the second vice president of my country, Pablo Iglesias. Commissioner Jourová, it would be interesting to have a European code of ethics for the use of social networks by public authorities and public officials, as a way of clarifying and establishing the standards of behavior required of public and government officials.

There are no magic solutions for complex issues, but the police or judges must be able to use technologies that avoid part of the impunity of the most sophisticated cybercrime or terrorism when it has very serious objectives and has enormous resources. Because impunity would also constitute a degradation of the right to justice that society has and, very specifically, the victims.

    "rawpv = 'Petar Vitanov, rapporteur. – Mr President, the EU regulatory framework needs to catch up with the technical developments. The use of AI has been growing exponentially and this brings the question as to what we, as co-legislators, are doing to safeguard the fundamental rights of European citizens. AI is not a product in itself, but it’s a method, it’s a tool, and, as such, it needs to be conditioned to the overarching goal of improving the well-being of our citizens. The technology holds great promise if it’s developed and used in an ethical and trustworthy manner, but at the same time, it implies considerable risks for fundamental rights, democracy and the rule of law. As co-legislators, we bear enormous responsibility towards European citizens. We need to draw clear red lines for AI—based systems that violate fundamental rights. If we are serious about safeguarding people’s safety and well-being, we need to include in the future legislation that can possibly ban or prohibit applications of AI that are incompatible with fundamental rights. Technical progress should never come at the expense of people’s fundamental rights. It’s not a question of whether the AI systems have the potential to result in racially biased and discriminatory outcomes. We actually know for sure that this is the case. We see the confirmation of this in the data provided by multiple NGOs. We saw it during the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) mission to Washington last year, and, just a couple of weeks ago, we heard it from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. And no, AI is not dangerous only when used by autocratic governments. Where the technology is flawed, it is flawed no matter who uses it and for what purposes. The good intention does not justify the means. There have been numerous cases of people being treated unjustly because of AI, such as being denied social security benefits because of faulty AI tools, or even being arrested because of flawed facial recognition, and somehow I’m not surprised that the victims are always the poor, the immigrants, the coloured or the Eastern Europeans. The American Civil Liberties Union demonstrated to the US Congress in May 2019 that the error rate with facial recognition of coloured people is higher, basically leading to de facto discrimination. They described facial recognition technology as unregulated, dangerous, racially biased and often untested. Using facial recognition in public areas may interfere with a person’s freedom of opinion and expression simply because of the fact that the protection of group anonymity no longer exists if everyone in the group could potentially be recognised. This could lead to those individuals changing their behaviour, for example by no longer participating in peaceful strikes or demonstrations. Predictive, profiling and risk-assessment AI and ultimate decision—making systems target individuals and profile them as criminals, resulting in serious criminal justice and civil outcomes and punishments before they have carried out the alleged action for which they are being profiled. I always thought that this could only happen in the movies! In essence, the very purpose of the systems is to undermine the fundamental right to be presumed innocent. Colleagues, I really hope that we can have a serious debate and I’m looking forward to it, but I’m pretty confident that we will place fundamental rights before technological progress, and even before security, because there cannot be any security without freedom.'\n",
    "rawpv2 = 'Mr President, I am also happy with this debate, because we agree on two things: the benefits of AI in law enforcement on one hand, and, of course, every single colleague here mentioned human rights, fundamental rights. Well, of course, there are divisions. There are definitely two groups. The first one, to which I belong, says that we keep fundamental rights by not letting the use of the unreliable application of AI in order to keep the fundamental rights, and the other group says, and they are convincing us about the conditions of the use of the same unreliable applications in their intentions to protect the unconditional human rights. Of course, it’s a political choice. My choice is simple. I urge you not to reject all of the amendments tabled, because they will significantly alter the spirit of this report. But of course, if you prefer the second option, please try to convince that single mother that works 12 hours a day in a poor neighbourhood because she cannot afford to live in a better neighbourhood, in a fancy neighbourhood, raising her own children, that her children are potential criminals, or try to convince the poor, the coloured, the immigrants, the foreigners that they are potential criminals only because the AI says so. Is this the world that we want to live in? Is this the world that we want for our children? Will we be able to sleep freely at night? To be honest, I cannot.'\n",

    "rawssp = 'Susana Solís Pérez, on behalf of the Renew Group. – Mr President, Commissioner, we have a great challenge ahead: the digital transformation of our society and our economy. Today we approve Digital Europe, a European program devoted entirely to digitization, but that is not enough and requires much more effort. Private capital must be attracted and recovery funds must be invested to accelerate the digital transition. Europe needs a lot of investment: in artificial intelligence, in supercomputers, in cybersecurity and in data centers, so as not to be left behind by the United States and China. We also need to invest in connectivity, so that 5G reaches rural areas and does not empty them out. And we need all citizens and SMEs, whether it is a neighborhood store, a car workshop or a rural hotel, to be able to benefit from digitization. And for that it is essential to invest in people: to train all workers, to train experts to cover the thousands of jobs that are not covered now and that all of us, young and old, are prepared for an increasingly important digital administration. Finally, we need a regulatory framework that allows us to trust technology, that respects our rights and fundamental values, and that gives companies security so that they can innovate, invest and grow. The European digital decade begins. Let us put all the resources so that no one is left behind.'\n",
    "rawssp2 = 'Mr President, I am very excited to present this report here in the European Parliament. Thirty years ago I decided to study engineering, as well as mechanics, and of course, we were a minority. I started working in the automotive sector and there were also very few women, because at that time, in the technology sector, women were underrepresented. But I always said that it was a matter of time and that, as women advanced more in equality, these figures would change drastically. But it has not been that way. And I am concerned that now that science and technology are transforming our society in unimaginable ways, women remain underrepresented in these fields. Today, only 36% of science, engineering, mathematics or technology graduates, the so-called STEM, are women. But if we go to areas such as digital or artificial intelligence, the figures drop to 12% and these percentages vary from country to country, but the trend is the same, and what is worse, it moves very little, hardly move. That is the problem. And in these days when many young people decide their future after taking university entrance exams, I think it is important that we make visible the social impact of STEM careers, moreover, at these times that are crucial for Europe, at a time when that Europe defines its future, how it will come out of the crisis, the recovery plans ⸻a recovery that we all know will be based on science and technology⸻. That is why I believe that this report is now more important than ever. And that is why today we ask the Commission and the countries of the European Union to focus on this challenge to turn the numbers around. Because it is not only a question of justice and the fight for equality. We also talk about the social and economic consequences of this imbalance. For example, it is estimated that jobs in the digital and scientific fields will grow by up to 20% in the coming years. If we women do not occupy these jobs, which are also better paid, and we do not increase our digital skills, the wage gap and the pension gap will only increase. But, in addition, if we women are absent from the technologies that are going to shape the future of our society and our world, biases in design will be perpetuated and discrimination by algorithms will increase. Therefore, we need to act and for this we have to tackle the problems at the root, from early education. And I like to say that it is not about imposing anything on anyone, but about being able to choose freely and eliminating the barriers, prejudices and stereotypes that still exist. Because boys and girls show the same predisposition and the same qualifications in STEM at very early ages. It is later when the girls leave. That is why we need to promote more female references to be inspired by, because what is not known is not chosen. We need more women in textbooks. The girls have to see that their work is going to have a social impact, that it is going to be recognized, that it is going to be supported. And as the report says, the role of the media and the role of teachers are going to be key to breaking down stereotypes. But, in addition, it is not only necessary that women arrive, but also that they do not abandon and that they can move up in the professional career; and without conciliation and more inclusive conditions, many are going to fall by the wayside. It is undeniable that women have children in the most prolific years of our careers. That is why the first thing is to advance in maternity and paternity leave. And if we do not include men, we will never achieve real equality. The second thing is that, to this day, the salary gap is still a reality and that the European Union cannot afford to block the Directive on salary transparency, especially if we see how opaque the big technology companies are. And the third thing is that, if we want to create more inclusive work environments, in which there are more women in management leadership and in which there is more security, we need to continue working. Lastly, I also wanted to highlight the low representation of women in start-ups and the difficulties faced by women entrepreneurs in accessing financing. One piece of information is enough: according to the latest EIB report, teams made up of women only receive only 2% of European funding. For this reason, we ask the Commission to encourage mixed teams, support specific mentoring programs and increase the number of women on boards of directors. I would like to thank all the colleagues who have participated in the drafting and negotiation of this report. I am sure that it will open the doors to educational and employment policies that will improve the situation of women in STEM. If we have learned anything from the COVID-19 crisis, it is the importance of science and research to overcome global problems. Without science, we will not find the answers, and without women, the future will again be designed by men and for men. All together we will turn the numbers around.'\n",

However, capitalist exploitation, the policy of the European Union and the bourgeois parties turn them into bonds for men and women, a tool to increase the intensification of labor and the expansion of work-rubber based on the reactionary direction of reconciliation of professional and personal life, strengthening the degree of exploitation of employees.

We must, because the EU seeks competitiveness, and the chance of survival for the Europe we know and want to pass on to the next generation depends on whether we manage to get something more innovative out of our workforce, which in these years will be both smaller and older. The smartest industries already know this, and fortunately the most adaptable companies are also well on their way to making themselves more attractive to women. Now the whole EU must get up to speed. Otherwise, we lose to our global competitors. China has long seen the light of day in having women in the STEM subjects. Not because they are particularly gender-oriented, but because the hands and heads of women are indispensable if the technological challenges of the future are to be addressed. China has calculated that it is not enough for men to develop the technology that women need, or vice versa for that matter. So when China can, so must the EU. More women in the STEM subjects is also important for creating a better interaction and more respect between the public and private sectors. Over the past corona year, we have somewhat forgotten that money for well-being and health does not grow on the trees with permanently low interest rates. More women in the STEM subjects will therefore also contribute to maintenance training respect for the important mechanism under EU competitiveness.'\n",
    "rawpw2 = 'Sir. Chairman! As you know, the devil is in the details. It applies in politics, and it applies in art and in politics that affect art and culture. There has been great concern around the world of culture as to whether we in the European Parliament could now abolish territorial exclusivity and geoblocking completely. So it sounds both old-fashioned and protectionist. Luckily we do not, but it was close. European film and television production is flourishing only because the economic foundation can use territorial exclusivity and geoblocking. Does this mean that not everyone can see everything at the same time? Yes, it does. But it is worth it too! We are currently talking a lot about \"the European way of life\" and what it means to be European in all its national nuances and cultural expressions. This is important at a time when the EU must be much more on its own two feet in an unpredictable world. Here, the EU must ensure that the Europe we know and have inherited from centuries of history of Christianity and democracy - royal houses and wars - is nurtured and carried on by virtue of a vibrant cultural landscape. A landscape from which we can continue to reap high quality art. In this world there are both evil devils and good devils. Territorial exclusivity and geoblocking are the latter. We must never forget this if European culture is to be remembered in the future.'\n",

    "rawhd = 'Helena Dalli, Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for this very interesting exchange. Gender equality is one of the fundamental values of the European Union and the European pillar of social rights makes it one of its key principles. The report highlights that if more women choose STEM-related studies and careers, the EU’s productivity and competitiveness will increase. We cannot achieve a dual green and digital transition in Europe without the participation of women in research and innovation. Innovative solutions and scientific excellence depend on diversity. We need diversity within our research teams in order to solve complex societal challenges, such as those – for instance – related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thanks to the gender-mainstreaming approach across all EU policies, we are achieving positive results. So the monitoring tools developed will help us keep track of this, be it the regional gender equality monitoring tool, including on data on women in STEM by the Joint Research Centre, or the monitoring tool for the implementation of the European strategy for gender equality by the Commission, I welcome that the European Parliament increasingly addresses the under-representation of women in STEM. The Commission is your ally and will continue to work with you to achieve the ambitious goals of this report.'\n",
    "rawhd2 = 'Mr President, I thank the rapporteur, Ms Susana Solís Pérez, the shadow rapporteur and the entire Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality (FEMM) for this excellent report. The European Parliament and the European Commission fully recognise equality between women and men as a strategic priority. The report welcomes the digital education action plan, which sets out a strategic approach to digital transformation in education and training, including the fight against the under—representation of girls and women in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM). In the digital sector, men still represent more than 80% of the workforce, and only one in three science, engineering and mathematics graduates are women. Given the need to stimulate diversity, one of the actions of the new digital education action plan responds to the need to increase the participation of women in STEM fields. The teaching of scientific and technical subjects is also a priority for cooperation projects in higher education under the Erasmus+ 2021 work programme. Ongoing work within the framework of the EU Coalition in the field of science, technology, engineering and mathematics will be exploited in conjunction with the results of already—funded Erasmus+ projects. The aim is to support the sharing of the best practices available in the framework of European university alliances and the establishment of national platforms in the field of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This action will contribute to the development of new higher education programmes for engineering, information and communication technologies based on the science, technology, engineering, the arts and mathematics (STEAM) approach. STEAM constitutes a multidisciplinary set of educational approaches, breaking down traditional divisions between subjects and disciplines in order to link the teaching of STEM and information and communication technologies to that of the arts, human sciences and social sciences. The COVID—19 crisis has strengthened the stereotypical roles of women and men, and thus we need to foster the full talent pool and promote women’s role and participation in all fields and all levels, such as in management. The digital education action plan also addresses the ethical implications of artificial intelligence, including gender bias, by developing ethical guidelines on AI and data in education and training. The Commission’s expert group responsible for developing the guidelines was recruited recently, and will launch guidelines in September 2022 as part of the back to school campaign, accompanied by awareness—raising activities. Education plays an important role in combating the under—representation of women in the field of development of new technologies and research. The PISA survey shows no difference in the skills of boys and girls in science, but gender differences widen when young people enter university and choose specific subjects and careers. To help Member States promote equality in education and training, a planned working group on equality and values in education and training will provide guidance for the use of gender—disaggregated data for the purposes of assessing policy reforms by the end of 2022. Gender equality is in fact one of the priorities of the new European Research Area, and the Horizon Europe programme makes it one of its transversal principles. Your report recognises the efforts made by the Commission to encourage the participation of women in STEM, in particular within the framework of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, while regretting the persistence of inequalities between women and men in terms of equal access to positions and funding within the European Union. Current efforts, with the support of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, and its knowledge and innovation communities, have helped to organise training activities for girls in primary, secondary and higher education in order to stimulate digital skills. The action is expected to reach 40 000 young female students. By introducing several new provisions in Horizon Europe, such as a new eligibility criteria, we want to bring change. From 2022, higher education and research institutions must put an action plan for gender equality in place to participate in the programme. Among other initiatives, the Women TechEU programme, within the European Innovation Council, aims to foster the creation of tech startups by women and support women’s entrepreneurship. Within the framework of the new European Research Area, we will develop, together with the Member States, a talent platform which will go beyond the current EURAXESS platform and will pay particular attention to equality between women and men. The Commission is also pleased with the Marie Skłodowska—Curie Actions, a programme for doctoral education and post—doctoral training, which encourages women to apply. Women researchers represent more than 41% of the number of researchers in the programme. This percentage is even higher among doctoral candidates, at nearly 45%, and postdoctoral researchers, at nearly 42%, who are funded by the programme. So the gender dimension is an important selection criterion in the evaluation process. The programme also supports equal opportunities through the principle of equal pay for all beneficiaries, providing family allowances, maternity and parental leave and the possibility of part—time work for family or personal reasons for everyone. In addition, the Commission has introduced new measures through the new Framework Programme in order to make this financial support fairer, more gender—friendly and more inclusive than it currently is. The Commission remains committed to continue working with Parliament in recognising equality between women and men as a strategic priority in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.'\n",

I am a staunch supporter of the Trade and Technology Council: we must strive as the EU and US to set global standards together. This is a big challenge. Chinese standardization is currently on the rise. If we do not set the tone, other powers will. Mr Dombrovskis, this must indeed be done on the basis of our shared values ​​and it will not always be easy. After all, on the one hand, we have the US, which has a huge lead in data and, moreover, has a single capital market, where there is hardly any regulation and much room for experimentation, and on the other the EU, which not only has to contend with a large arrears, but also has a tendency to want to arrange too much. The Commission should therefore adopt incentive regulations without undue barriers. I also agree with the commitment of Mr Dombrovskis to a more intense partnership. We need to put all the issues on the table: the protectionist “Buy American Act”, the “Jones Act” and also the impending tariffs on electric vehicles. A sustainable partnership must be based on openness and equality. Finally, I would like to call for going beyond the legislative dialogue and pursuing the establishment of a genuine transatlantic parliamentary cooperative.'\n",

The platforms will run every message through their algorithm resulting in hyperpolitically correct censorship, as was the case with Facebook. The EU should take freedom of expression as a starting point and impose a universal service obligation on these platforms. After all, the platforms are both the mail and letterboxes of the twenty-first century. The censorship should be limited to an exhaustive set of serious cases. The rest is up to the judge to decide, as it should be in a constitutional state. I come from one of the few countries where censorship is constitutionally prohibited.

It was great to see the Trade and Technology Council (TTC) being embraced in such a great way, in a bipartisan way. If I didn’t know any better, I would have thought that it was an American idea to begin with, which is great. A new transatlantic initiative that will allow us to work on the challenges we are faced with today. I look forward to strong cooperation on setting new digital standards on foreign direct investment (FDI) screening, on fighting unfair competition coming from non—market economies, to name a few. But let’s not forget that the same people who are shaking hands over the TTC now are also the ones in charge of negotiating the trade irritants and challenges that are still hanging over our heads, even if they may be suspended for two or five years. Of course, we know our interests will never fully coincide, but let’s use this momentum of the TTC and stop fighting each other with unnecessary or illegal tariffs and join forces on working together on global trade challenges. So now we have to get beyond words and actually come to concrete and tangible deliverables. This would be my most important question to the Commissioners here this morning: what do you see as a concrete deliverable in the very near future? I look forward to your answer.'\n",

Children should be able to move freely and safely without carrying around with them for the rest of their lives a digital footprint that is many times larger than their own shoe size. Everything stands or falls with a good age verification. However, this also means that when drawing up new rules, whether it concerns rules on artificial intelligence in educational tools or the requirements we place on computer games, we must look specifically at what a child can and cannot understand and oversee, and in doing so should not take current self-regulation, but scientific findings as a starting point.

First of all, I am pleased that we are finally once again dealing with one of the core issues of the EU, namely international trade - which is not always the case here. It is about strengthening the transatlantic partnership between the USA and the European Union in very broad areas - technology exchange and trade. And that is to be welcomed in principle, especially in view of the increasing threat from China, and such a cooperation makes sense especially because of the distortion of competition by China that does not conform to the market. I only refer to Chinese dumping prices, dumping wages, forced technology transfer in joint ventures, product piracy and, and, and.

And citizen involvement is only desired as long as it does not deviate from the specified course. And right now, when the failure of the EU is obvious to all citizens, right now, of course, you really want to take action against so-called disinformation. Otherwise the citizens could ask themselves uncomfortable questions, for example why trillions of euros are being redistributed but there is no money at all for effective vaccines. Or why the EU wants to destroy its own industry through the Green Deal in the middle of the economic crisis. Or why the EU wants to open the floodgates for migrants.
