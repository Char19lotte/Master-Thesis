    "raw1_1 = 'Ana Paula Zacarias, President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, recent weeks have shown that even the most robust democratic structures are not safe from damage. What happened on the other side of the Atlantic must inform our debate in Europe, as our democratic societies are not immune to the harmful influence of hate speech, disinformation, fake news and incitement to violence. These events have also shed light on the increased importance of online platforms and social media companies in shaping public debate. They have highlighted the growing interconnection that exists between digital transformation and democracy, which is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency. It is unquestionable that social media companies have the status of public squares, which means they should have responsibilities when it comes to enhancing citizens’ participation and ensuring freedom of expression. Nevertheless, freedom of expression is not absolute. It should be balanced with the goal of combating illegal hate speech, incitement to violence and radicalisation, both online and offline. What is illegal? What is illegal offline must be illegal online. Online platforms have repeatedly been criticised for the lack of transparency in the use of algorithms, on content moderation and for targeting users on the basis of a vast amount of personal data generated from online activity. The digital space has also become a breeding ground for conspiracies and fake news. Disinformation spreads faster than any virus. Education, media and digital literacy are the best vaccines against that. We expect online platforms to play their part in this common fight, but it is up to the democratic institutions – our laws, our courts – to set the rules of the game, to define what is illegal and what is not, what must be removed and what should not be. Without democratic scrutiny and a level playing field, there is a risk to users’ rights, information flows and public participation. The protection of fundamental rights requires transparent and consistent rules for all of us, including social media outlets. The recently proposed European Democracy Action Plan, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act are important steps forward and will make the digital environment more transparent and actors like social media companies more accountable. The Council has already started the discussions on these important instruments. These initiatives must also be considered in conjunction with the upcoming Media and Audiovisual Action Plan, which will be the subject of the Council conclusions that we intend to adopt during our Presidency. In addition, we are expecting, for the third quarter of the year, a Commission legislative proposal to ensure greater transparency in the area of sponsored content in a public context, complementing the Digital Services Act. The Council is ready to cooperate with this Parliament to ensure adoption sufficiently ahead of the 2024 European elections. Moreover, the Presidency will host the Digital Assembly in Lisbon in June, where the concepts of digital democracy and digital rights will be discussed. The Presidency intends to consolidate the idea that Europe is a reference in the digital era and that our values and way of doing business are a competitive advantage. We want to place this idea at the heart of the European Digital Strategy for the next digital decade. The Presidency will also hold a high—level conference on the future of journalism and its interconnection with artificial intelligence, with a special focus on the robotisation of news production. The current times have brought into sharp relief the unavoidable reality that what is happening online shapes our lives, beliefs and choices. It deeply influences what we buy or who we vote for, who we listen to, and even our opinion on vaccines. In its recent conclusions, the Council stressed the need to foster a well—functioning digital public sphere, greater accountability and improved transparency in addressing disinformation. Countering this scourge is crucial to preserve open political debate and the effective participation of citizens. We need to prevent social media functioning as an echo chamber which suppresses different points of view, and we need to make sure our citizens are equipped to manage the flood of information they are exposed to every day. In times such as this, believing in unreliable information may be lethal. We welcome, therefore, the work on the Rapid Alert System and other monitoring instruments. We encourage support for media and digital literacy, media pluralism, media independence and fact checking. Let me reassure you that the Presidency is committed to working with the European Parliament, the Commission and the European External Action Service on these crucial issues in order to promote and protect our fundamental rights and our democracy.'"

      "Ana Paula Zacarias , President-in-Office of the Council . – Madam President , recent weeks have shown that even the most robust democratic structures are not safe from damage . What happened on the other side of the Atlantic must inform our debate in Europe , as our democratic societies are not immune to the harmful influence of hate speech , disinformation , fake news and incitement to violence . These events have also shed light on the increased importance of online platforms and social media companies in shaping public debate . They have highlighted the growing interconnection that exists between digital transformation and democracy , which is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency . It is unquestionable that social media companies have the status of public squares , which means they should have responsibilities when it comes to enhancing citizens ’ participation and ensuring freedom of expression . Nevertheless , freedom of expression is not absolute . It should be balanced with the goal of combating illegal hate speech , incitement to violence and radicalisation , both online and offline . What is illegal ? What is illegal offline must be illegal online . Online platforms have repeatedly been criticised for the lack of transparency in the use of algorithms , on content moderation and for targeting users on the basis of a vast amount of personal data generated from online activity . The digital space has also become a breeding ground for conspiracies and fake news . Disinformation spreads faster than any virus . Education , media and digital literacy are the best vaccines against that . We expect online platforms to play their part in this common fight , but it is up to the democratic institutions – our laws , our courts – to set the rules of the game , to define what is illegal and what is not , what must be removed and what should not be . Without democratic scrutiny and a level playing field , there is a risk to users ’ rights , information flows and public participation . The protection of fundamental rights requires transparent and consistent rules for all of us , including social media outlets . The recently proposed European Democracy Action Plan , the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act are important steps forward and will make the digital environment more transparent and actors like social media companies more accountable . The Council has already started the discussions on these important instruments . These initiatives must also be considered in conjunction with the upcoming Media and Audiovisual Action Plan , which will be the subject of the Council conclusions that we intend to adopt during our Presidency . In addition , we are expecting , for the third quarter of the year , a Commission legislative proposal to ensure greater transparency in the area of sponsored content in a public context , complementing the Digital Services Act . The Council is ready to cooperate with this Parliament to ensure adoption sufficiently ahead of the 2024 European elections . Moreover , the Presidency will host the Digital Assembly in Lisbon in June , where the concepts of digital democracy and digital rights will be discussed . The Presidency intends to consolidate the idea that Europe is a reference in the digital era and that our values and way of doing business are a competitive advantage . We want to place this idea at the heart of the European Digital Strategy for the next digital decade . The Presidency will also hold a high—level conference on the future of journalism and its interconnection with artificial intelligence , with a special focus on the robotisation of news production . The current times have brought into sharp relief the unavoidable reality that what is happening online shapes our lives , beliefs and choices . It deeply influences what we buy or who we vote for , who we listen to , and even our opinion on vaccines . In its recent conclusions , the Council stressed the need to foster a well—functioning digital public sphere , greater accountability and improved transparency in addressing disinformation . Countering this scourge is crucial to preserve open political debate and the effective participation of citizens . We need to prevent social media functioning as an echo chamber which suppresses different points of view , and we need to make sure our citizens are equipped to manage the flood of information they are exposed to every day . In times such as this , believing in unreliable information may be lethal . We welcome , therefore , the work on the Rapid Alert System and other monitoring instruments . We encourage support for media and digital literacy , media pluralism , media independence and fact checking . Let me reassure you that the Presidency is committed to working with the European Parliament , the Commission and the European External Action Service on these crucial issues in order to promote and protect our fundamental rights and our democracy .

    "raw1_2 = 'Věra Jourová, Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for organising this debate. I know we don’t have much time, so I will try to be brief rather than exhaustive in my introductory remarks. Social media has transformed the way we communicate with each other, debate on political issues or do campaigning. There are a lot of new opportunities, but also a lot of problems. With the recent attack on the Capitol, we’ve got a tangible yet tragic proof that many people have simply lost trust in democratic institutions. Going online only exacerbated many of the existing problems and cleavages in our societies. The US events are the moment of reckoning, also because they reminded us of the power Twitter, Facebook and other technological corporations possess. The fact that they can permanently remove an account of a sitting president based on vague criteria and unclear oversight is really worrying. Even though, I believe President Trump’s irresponsible incitement to violence deserved action, it is high time to reign in the unchecked power of the digital corporations. Whatever we do, we must uphold the principle of freedom of speech. I do not want to create the ministry of or arbiter of truth. This is the main principle. So what can we do? First, we need tougher regulation, more enforceable obligations and to increase the responsibility of digital players. We have recently proposed the Digital Services Act, that will increase accountability of online platforms and clarify the rules for taking down illegal content, including hate speech and incitement to violence. This is a ground-breaking proposal, and will also give us the tools for stronger monitoring and enforcement of the obligations of online platforms. We need these rules urgently and we are ready to work together with you and the Member States to quickly adopt this law. What can we do already now, while waiting for the Digital Services Act to become law? We can equip ourselves already now with better tools to fight disinformation and harmful content. The European Democracy Action Plan is our map of what we should do next in this respect. We can already now strike a new pact against disinformation with better accountability of algorithms and no arbitrary decisions by big online platforms. We can and should have more transparency of their policies and access to relevant data. In the Digital Services Act we moved away from assessing harmful content and focused on the manipulative techniques of online distribution. We need to go more in detail on this – paid promotion and paid likes, reactions from fake accounts, bots can be particularly dangerous for democracy, notably during elections. This is why I will propose new regulation on online political advertising. And freedom of speech is not the same as freedom of reach. Regulation alone will not, and in my view should not, address all the details of digital life. When I talked to Mark Zuckerberg and other CEOs of the Big Tech, we discussed solutions that go beyond regulation because we must not sacrifice freedom of expression, which requires open space, be it online or offline. They cannot judge and evaluate every piece of content posted on them. This is why we need to reshape the thinking of tech companies and tech workers. Architects follow not only law but also ethical codes to ensure that the buildings they design are safe for people. Coders and IT experts should have a similar approach when designing their algorithms, something I rarely hear from the tech executives. And third, we cannot focus on social media platforms alone. We need to make our education fit for digital reality. We all have to become more digitally literate, understand the basics of what is happening online and why we are seeing certain content. This will allow us to navigate safely online. As a person coming, as many of you do, from an ex—totalitarian country, in my case communist Czechoslovakia, I have tasted life without democracy and freedom of speech. I believe we need to bring order to the digital expression of democracy and to end the digital Wild West. What is illegal offline must be illegal online, but we also have to work on restoring trust among citizens. Facts belong to everyone. Opinions belong to an individual. And this distinction has been damaged and can only be repaired if there is trust in science, in authorities and society. We all have a very important role to play in this as well.'"

      "Věra Jourová , Vice-President of the Commission . – Madam President , honourable Members , thank you for organising this debate . I know we don ’ t have much time , so I will try to be brief rather than exhaustive in my introductory remarks . Social media has transformed the way we communicate with each other , debate on political issues or do campaigning . There are a lot of new opportunities , but also a lot of problems . With the recent attack on the Capitol , we ’ ve got a tangible yet tragic proof that many people have simply lost trust in democratic institutions . Going online only exacerbated many of the existing problems and cleavages in our societies . The US events are the moment of reckoning , also because they reminded us of the power Twitter , Facebook and other technological corporations possess . The fact that they can permanently remove an account of a sitting president based on vague criteria and unclear oversight is really worrying . Even though , I believe President Trump ’ s irresponsible incitement to violence deserved action , it is high time to reign in the unchecked power of the digital corporations . Whatever we do , we must uphold the principle of freedom of speech . I do not want to create the ministry of or arbiter of truth . This is the main principle . So what can we do ? First , we need tougher regulation , more enforceable obligations and to increase the responsibility of digital players . We have recently proposed the Digital Services Act , that will increase accountability of online platforms and clarify the rules for taking down illegal content , including hate speech and incitement to violence . This is a ground-breaking proposal , and will also give us the tools for stronger monitoring and enforcement of the obligations of online platforms . We need these rules urgently and we are ready to work together with you and the Member States to quickly adopt this law . What can we do already now , while waiting for the Digital Services Act to become law ? We can equip ourselves already now with better tools to fight disinformation and harmful content . The European Democracy Action Plan is our map of what we should do next in this respect . We can already now strike a new pact against disinformation with better accountability of algorithms and no arbitrary decisions by big online platforms . We can and should have more transparency of their policies and access to relevant data . In the Digital Services Act we moved away from assessing harmful content and focused on the manipulative techniques of online distribution . We need to go more in detail on this – paid promotion and paid likes , reactions from fake accounts , bots can be particularly dangerous for democracy , notably during elections . This is why I will propose new regulation on online political advertising . And freedom of speech is not the same as freedom of reach . Regulation alone will not , and in my view should not , address all the details of digital life . When I talked to Mark Zuckerberg and other CEOs of the Big Tech , we discussed solutions that go beyond regulation because we must not sacrifice freedom of expression , which requires open space , be it online or offline . They can not judge and evaluate every piece of content posted on them . This is why we need to reshape the thinking of tech companies and tech workers . Architects follow not only law but also ethical codes to ensure that the buildings they design are safe for people . Coders and IT experts should have a similar approach when designing their algorithms , something I rarely hear from the tech executives . And third , we can not focus on social media platforms alone . We need to make our education fit for digital reality . We all have to become more digitally literate , understand the basics of what is happening online and why we are seeing certain content . This will allow us to navigate safely online . As a person coming , as many of you do , from an ex—totalitarian country , in my case communist Czechoslovakia , I have tasted life without democracy and freedom of speech . I believe we need to bring order to the digital expression of democracy and to end the digital Wild West . What is illegal offline must be illegal online , but we also have to work on restoring trust among citizens . Facts belong to everyone . Opinions belong to an individual . And this distinction has been damaged and can only be repaired if there is trust in science , in authorities and society . We all have a very important role to play in this as well . "

    "raw1_3 = 'Magdalena Adamowicz, on behalf of the PPE group. - Madam President! Commissioner! Ladies and gentlemen! The war for media freedom has been going on in Poland for several hours. The war on whether Polish citizens can know the truth or whether the authorities are to decide what this truth should be. While lying that it is about more taxes, the authorities are really about more obedience to their citizens. Because the authorities want to cultivate the obedience of citizens with the help of the media they subordinate to. Like in Hungary. As in Russia. What should we do when the authorities of a European Union member state deprive their citizens of the right to reliable information? Again, Parliament is to say: we do not have our Brussels approval for this? Just talking again? Stomp your foot and scream? There is a limit beyond which helplessness becomes a humiliation. A humiliation for those who stand alone for freedom and democracy. As the Roman maxim, \"Vim vi repellere licet\" says, you can resist force by force. Force adequate to the threat. That is why I call on the entire European Union to act accordingly. That is why I call on all free media in the world to show solidarity with Polish free media. Because if it happened to us, it can happen to you. I end here. What is left of my time I spend in silence. For the silence to be a warning. Because if we do not react now with action, this moment of silence may soon become a minute of silence, of silence over the coffin of Polish democracy. And if it is Polish, then European too.'"

      "Magdalena Adamowicz , on behalf of the PPE group . - Madam President ! Commissioner ! Ladies and gentlemen ! The war for media freedom has been going on in Poland for several hours . The war on whether Polish citizens can know the truth or whether the authorities are to decide what this truth should be . While lying that it is about more taxes , the authorities are really about more obedience to their citizens . Because the authorities want to cultivate the obedience of citizens with the help of the media they subordinate to . Like in Hungary . As in Russia . What should we do when the authorities of a European Union member state deprive their citizens of the right to reliable information ? Again , Parliament is to say : we do not have our Brussels approval for this ? Just talking again ? Stomp your foot and scream ? There is a limit beyond which helplessness becomes a humiliation . A humiliation for those who stand alone for freedom and democracy . As the Roman maxim , `` Vim vi repellere licet '' says , you can resist force by force . Force adequate to the threat . That is why I call on the entire European Union to act accordingly . That is why I call on all free media in the world to show solidarity with Polish free media . Because if it happened to us , it can happen to you . I end here . What is left of my time I spend in silence . For the silence to be a warning . Because if we do not react now with action , this moment of silence may soon become a minute of silence , of silence over the coffin of Polish democracy . And if it is Polish , then European too . "

Although some measures have been introduced, such as the East StratCom Task Force, they have so far been insufficient to counter efficiently the assault on our democracies. After the riots in Capitol Hill, the ultimate price of allowing disinformation and hatred to spread unchecked online is clear for all of us. Finding a balance between limiting harmful content while maintaining freedom of speech might be a challenging task, but it is doable and it must be addressed now. I look forward to this debate, particularly as we now have a concrete opportunity to address these issues through new draft legislation, including the Digital Services Act, which will establish new rules, including on advertising, transparency, illegal content removal and data access. Continuing to improve the Commission’s code of conduct on disinformation is a necessary step. But we also need to extend our offline safeguards to the online world by limiting the use of targeted advertising and the profiling of users. I welcome the Commission’s initiative on online political advertising. We also need to explore ways to promote media literacy skills to increase users’ knowledge. With the GDPR, the EU led the way and set an example. Now we need to go further. The Digital Services Act can facilitate the development of our digital economy while protecting fundamental rights and providing increased security from online harms. This is our EU opportunity to lead the way, and I hope that we can do it together with our allies in the United States and beyond.'"

But social media platforms are private companies so they alone do not have the incentive, the means or the legitimacy to take on politicians or state actors. They require democratic oversight and assistance for that, just as we require from them cooperation and compliance. So we are not adversaries, us and the platforms. We need to find together a burden-sharing equilibrium that guarantees both the common good and technological progress. My third point is that social media is global and geopolitical, so we need to use our entire diplomatic arsenal to protect our citizens’ rights and our way of life online. We need to work with the United States and other like-minded partners to define the rules of the future based on our shared values. And we need to use our dissuasion tools to address appropriately states such as Russia who use social media to sabotage our democracies and our common European project, or states such as China who work to build an alternative digital future without playing by the same rules or without relating to the same values.'\n",

We must ensure the best conditions for democratic dialogue, even when it takes place virtually. That is why it is a very important debate we have today.'\n",

The recent decision by a private online platform to remove the profile of a democratically elected president is a dangerous precedent . No one , not even the private owners of online platforms , should deprive anyone of the right to express themselves . This can only happen in exceptional circumstances on the basis of a democratically passed law . From a formal point of view , Twitter can be private property , and by its function it is a deeply social entity .

The recent decision by a private online platform to remove the profile of a democratically elected president is a dangerous precedent. No one, not even the private owners of online platforms, should deprive anyone of the right to express themselves. This can only happen in exceptional circumstances on the basis of a democratically passed law. From a formal point of view, Twitter can be private property, and by its function it is a deeply social entity.

They mean that it has become easier to divide our societies. Attempts at division made from outside, that is what we deal with in the disinformation special committee to fight against disinformation. We are working on that in the European Parliament, and there are also attempts at division from within. What happened on Capitol Hill in the United States in Washington DC is just the tip of the iceberg of what is possible. What we have to ensure, because parliamentarism is also one of the values ​​of our civilization, is that it is parliaments that set the rules with laws and not private companies that can do the censorship.'\n",

      "Věra Jourová , Vice-President of the Commission . – Madam President , I want to thank the honourable Members for this debate and for all your opinions and views . For me it is extremely important to hear the opinions of this House because this is the first broad debate about if , and how , to regulate the Internet if I may simplify that . And I take several main messages . First , what I heard from the vast majority of you is : it ’ s time to get to work . If we are not ambitious to become the rule-makers we will continue to be the rule-takers , the rules which have been created in Silicon Valley and which are imposed on our territory in the EU . So it ’ s time to get to work with a sense of urgency and I very much count on the European Parliament and your approach to adopt the legislation which the Commission proposed soon enough . Also because we see a lot of impatience on the side of some Member States who want to go their own way . They want to have their own rules for the Internet and I think that it was quite clear also from this debate that we want to have a pan-European smart solution without any fragmentation by Member States . The second main message which I got is that we are searching and working on the ideologically-neutral solution that the rules we are going to adopt should not be left or right , and that we will seek the solution which will protect the freedom of speech as the primary principle . So these are the main messages I took from this very important debate . Coming back to the rule-makers , what we are doing is the continuation of the effort of the EU to be the rule-maker with global effect . We already managed to do that with the GDPR where we said that individual people must have the right to have their identity , their privacy , under control . And now we are coming with a set of , I hope , consistent rules which are also consistent with the GDPR and its philosophy . We are coming with the Digital Services Act , the Digital Markets Act , the European Democracy Action Plan , and by all that we want to prove that the EU has a very healthy instinct when it comes to the risks which we see on the Internet and which can cause big harm to our societies . What I heard from many of you was that the digital big tech grabbed too much power and too little responsibility . I would add I agree with that . The platforms captured a lot of public space . I sometimes say that they privatised the public space , and this is a public space without any public scrutiny whatsoever . So this is also our task : to demand more transparency and more accountability , because what ’ s happening online is heavily influencing real life . I think it was Mr Tudorache who said that there is no difference between online and offline , that it ’ s one world . I tend to agree with that . On the other hand , it ’ s quite easy to blame the Internet and platforms for all our troubles . I think that we should really take a lesson from what happened in the US at the beginning of January . The platforms for the transmitters of the messages of the former President Trump who was inciting violence , whipping up the crowd who then invaded the Capitol , and there were victims , there were dead people . So I think this is also a very strong goal on all of us who have influence on public opinion and on the reaction of our society to be more responsible and to be aware that social media can be a weapon , a dangerous weapon in our hands . I am not calling for self-censoring for politicians . I am calling for more responsibility and awareness of the consequences when we use these social platforms and social media . I would like to recommend that you read Madeleine Albright ’ s book Fascism : A Warning . She speaks about social media as a weapon when it is used by bad people , when it appears in bad hands . Let me react to several comments regarding disinformation in the time of COVID . I ’ m sure you know that the Commission has an agreement with big tech to do more against disinformation . So it ’ s not true that they have just started now , and I appreciate the recent announcement of Facebook that they want to do more against disinformation relating to vaccination . The agreement is simple . I wanted them to enable more space for information from authorities , from health authorities , from those who are responsible for communication and for providing the people with trustworthy and evidence-based information . For the health sector I think that is a very clear message : if you do not occupy the space it will be occupied by disinformation . The Ministers of Health are aware of that and they do their best . I have to praise them for everything they are doing in this very difficult moment and crisis , and they are doing their best to occupy the space with reliable information . The thing is that the people have to trust the information provided by the health authorities . The fight against disinformation also contains what we offer or what we propose . It contains fact-checking . Honourable Members , let me do this now . I have to react to Mr Haider who said that the EU has not invested anything into the development and production of vaccination . This is fake news , and I think that if something like that is said , it ’ s also our obligation to come with the facts and deny that . I also want to react because we speak here about the freedom of speech . I want to react to those who were mentioning the situation in Poland . I think we all have seen the black screens . The black screens are quite telling . I think they are screaming . Today it ’ s a question of protest of the media in Poland , expressed in a black screen . Tomorrow black screens might become a sad everyday reality . We also need to protect the freedom of speech by supporting independent media , not by suppressing them with additional financial burdens . This doesn ’ t apply only to Poland . We have recommended many times to the Member States that they should support also financially media who are also the frontrunners in the COVID crisis , media which were already before the COVID crisis under big financial distress because the business model has changed brutally .

    "raw1_73 = 'Věra Jourová, Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, I want to thank the honourable Members for this debate and for all your opinions and views. For me it is extremely important to hear the opinions of this House because this is the first broad debate about if, and how, to regulate the Internet if I may simplify that. And I take several main messages. First, what I heard from the vast majority of you is: it’s time to get to work. If we are not ambitious to become the rule-makers we will continue to be the rule-takers, the rules which have been created in Silicon Valley and which are imposed on our territory in the EU. So it’s time to get to work with a sense of urgency and I very much count on the European Parliament and your approach to adopt the legislation which the Commission proposed soon enough. Also because we see a lot of impatience on the side of some Member States who want to go their own way. They want to have their own rules for the Internet and I think that it was quite clear also from this debate that we want to have a pan-European smart solution without any fragmentation by Member States. The second main message which I got is that we are searching and working on the ideologically-neutral solution that the rules we are going to adopt should not be left or right, and that we will seek the solution which will protect the freedom of speech as the primary principle. So these are the main messages I took from this very important debate. Coming back to the rule-makers, what we are doing is the continuation of the effort of the EU to be the rule-maker with global effect. We already managed to do that with the GDPR where we said that individual people must have the right to have their identity, their privacy, under control. And now we are coming with a set of, I hope, consistent rules which are also consistent with the GDPR and its philosophy. We are coming with the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act, the European Democracy Action Plan, and by all that we want to prove that the EU has a very healthy instinct when it comes to the risks which we see on the Internet and which can cause big harm to our societies. What I heard from many of you was that the digital big tech grabbed too much power and too little responsibility. I would add I agree with that. The platforms captured a lot of public space. I sometimes say that they privatised the public space, and this is a public space without any public scrutiny whatsoever. So this is also our task: to demand more transparency and more accountability, because what’s happening online is heavily influencing real life. I think it was Mr Tudorache who said that there is no difference between online and offline, that it’s one world. I tend to agree with that. On the other hand, it’s quite easy to blame the Internet and platforms for all our troubles. I think that we should really take a lesson from what happened in the US at the beginning of January. The platforms for the transmitters of the messages of the former President Trump who was inciting violence, whipping up the crowd who then invaded the Capitol, and there were victims, there were dead people. So I think this is also a very strong goal on all of us who have influence on public opinion and on the reaction of our society to be more responsible and to be aware that social media can be a weapon, a dangerous weapon in our hands. I am not calling for self-censoring for politicians. I am calling for more responsibility and awareness of the consequences when we use these social platforms and social media. I would like to recommend that you read Madeleine Albright’s book Fascism: A Warning. She speaks about social media as a weapon when it is used by bad people, when it appears in bad hands. Let me react to several comments regarding disinformation in the time of COVID. I’m sure you know that the Commission has an agreement with big tech to do more against disinformation. So it’s not true that they have just started now, and I appreciate the recent announcement of Facebook that they want to do more against disinformation relating to vaccination. The agreement is simple. I wanted them to enable more space for information from authorities, from health authorities, from those who are responsible for communication and for providing the people with trustworthy and evidence-based information. For the health sector I think that is a very clear message: if you do not occupy the space it will be occupied by disinformation. The Ministers of Health are aware of that and they do their best. I have to praise them for everything they are doing in this very difficult moment and crisis, and they are doing their best to occupy the space with reliable information. The thing is that the people have to trust the information provided by the health authorities. The fight against disinformation also contains what we offer or what we propose. It contains fact-checking. Honourable Members, let me do this now. I have to react to Mr Haider who said that the EU has not invested anything into the development and production of vaccination. This is fake news, and I think that if something like that is said, it’s also our obligation to come with the facts and deny that. I also want to react because we speak here about the freedom of speech. I want to react to those who were mentioning the situation in Poland. I think we all have seen the black screens. The black screens are quite telling. I think they are screaming. Today it’s a question of protest of the media in Poland, expressed in a black screen. Tomorrow black screens might become a sad everyday reality. We also need to protect the freedom of speech by supporting independent media, not by suppressing them with additional financial burdens. This doesn’t apply only to Poland. We have recommended many times to the Member States that they should support also financially media who are also the frontrunners in the COVID crisis, media which were already before the COVID crisis under big financial distress because the business model has changed brutally. The money from advertisers is being shifted to the online sphere which we keep speaking about today, and so we need to guarantee that the media can do their job because they have a very important role in our democratic societies. So coming back to the law which we are now analysing. I have to say that we always advise the Member States to support media, as I said, but coming to the law, we are aware of the draft law and we need to look into it in more detail. We expect Member States to ensure that their fiscal or other policies will not affect the commitment to ensuring a free independent and diverse media ecosystem. I have to add that about the legislative process, which is ongoing in Poland, that it is important to consult such legislation also with the media sector, and I understand from the recent information from Poland that this is foreseen. I am sorry, I probably was longer than I wanted to be, but I really wanted to react to many of your very important opinions, which I had to take.'\n",
