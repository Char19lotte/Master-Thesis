      "The PRESIDENT . It is good to be back . Mitch and Chuck will understand that it is good to be almost home , down the hall . Madam Speaker , Madam Vice President -- no President has ever said those words from this podium ; no President has ever said those words , and it is about time -- the First Lady -- I am her husband -- the Second Gentleman , Mr. Chief Justice , Members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet , and distinguished guests , my fellow Americans : While the setting tonight is familiar , this gathering is just a little bit different , a reminder of the extraordinary times we are in . Throughout our history , Presidents have come to this Chamber to speak to Congress , to the Nation , and to the world to declare war , to celebrate peace , to announce new plans and possibilities . Tonight , I come to talk about crisis and opportunity , about rebuilding our Nation and revitalizing our democracy , and winning the future for America . I stand here tonight 1 day shy of the 100th day of my administration , 100 days since I took the oath of office , lifted my hand off our family Bible , and inherited a nation -- we all did -- that was in crisis : the worst pandemic in a century , the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War . Now , after just 100 days , I can report to the Nation : America is on the move again , turning peril into possibility , crisis into opportunity , setback into strength . We all know life can knock us down . But in America , we never stay down . Americans always get up . And today , that is what we are doing : America is rising anew , choosing hope over fear , truth over lies , light over darkness . After 100 days of rescue and renewal , America is ready for takeoff , in my view . We are working again , dreaming again , discovering again , leading the world again . We have shown each other and the world there is no quit in America ; none . One hundred days ago , America 's house was on fire . We had to act . And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Schumer , and with the overwhelming support of the American people -- Democrats , Independents , and Republicans -- we did act . Together , we passed the American Rescue Plan , one of the most consequential rescue packages in American history . We are already seeing the results . After I promised we would get 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots into people 's arms in 100 days , we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in those 100 days ; thanks to all the help of all of you . We are marshalling -- with your help , everyone 's help , we are marshalling every Federal resource . We have gotten vaccines to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 community health centers , where the poorest of the poor can be reached . We are setting up community vaccination sites , deploying mobile units to get the hard-to-reach communities . Today , 90 percent of Americans now live within 5 miles of a vaccination site . Everyone over the age of 16 -- everyone -- is now eligible to get vaccinated right now , right away . Go get vaccinated , America . Go and get the vaccination . They are available . You are eligible now . When I was sworn in on January 20 , less than 1 percent of the seniors in America were fully vaccinated against COVID-19 . One hundred days later , 70 percent of seniors over 65 in America are protected -- fully protected . Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80 percent since January -- down 80 percent because of all of you . And more than half of all the adults in America have gotten at least one shot . At a mass vaccination center in Glendale , Arizona , I asked the nurse : `` What is it like ? '' She looked at me and said every shot is like giving a `` dose of hope , '' was her phrase ; `` a dose of hope . '' A dose of hope for the educator in Florida , who has a child suffering from an autoimmune disease . She wrote to me that she was worried about bringing the virus home . She said she then got vaccinated at a large site in her car . She said she sat in her car when she got vaccinated and just cried -- cried out of joy and cried out of relief . Parents are seeing the smiles on their kids ' faces , for those who are able to go back to school , because the teachers and school bus drivers and cafeteria workers have been vaccinated . Grandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing hands against the window to say good-bye . It means everything . Those things mean everything . There is still -- you all know it -- you know it better than any group of Americans -- there is still more work to do to beat this virus . We ca n't let our guard down . But , tonight , I can say because of you , the American people , our [ [ Page H2119 ] ] progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history has been one of the greatest logistical achievements this country has ever seen . What else have we done in those first 100 days ? We kept our commitment -- Democrats and Republicans -- of sending $ 1,400 rescue checks to 85 percent of American households . We already sent more than 160 million checks out the door . It is making a difference . You all know it when you go home . For many people , it is making all the difference in the world . A single mom in Texas wrote to me . She said she could n't work . But she said the relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction from their apartment . A grandmother in Virginia , who told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor -- something she said she put off for months because she did n't have the money . One of the defining images , at least from my perspective , in this crisis has been cars lined up for miles -- and not people just barely able to start those cars ; nice cars -- waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk . I do n't know about you , but I did n't ever think I would see that in America . And all of this is through no fault of their own -- no fault of their own , these people are in this position . That is why the American Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger , and hunger is down sharply already . We are also providing rental assistance -- you all know this , but the American people , I want to make sure they understand -- keeping people from being evicted from their homes , providing loans so small businesses could reopen and keep their employees on the job . During these 100 days , an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act when I established a special sign-up period to do that -- 800,000 in that period . We are making one of the largest one- time investments ever in improving healthcare for veterans ; critical investments to address the opioid crisis . And , maybe most importantly , thanks to the American Rescue Plan , we are on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year . In the process , while this is all going on , the economy created more than 1.3 million new jobs in 100 days ; more jobs in the first 100 days than any President on record . The International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6 percent this year . That would be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades . America is moving , moving forward . But we ca n't stop now . We are in competition with China and other countries to win the 21st century . We are at a great inflection point in history . We have to do more than just build back . We have to build back better . We have to compete more strenuously than we have . Throughout our history -- think about it -- public investment and infrastructure have literally transformed America -- our attitudes , as well as our opportunities . The transcontinental railroad and the interstate highways united two oceans and brought a totally new age of progress to the United States of America . Universal public schools and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity . Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon and now to Mars , discovered vaccines , gave us the internet , and so much more . These are the investments we made together as one country , and investments that only the government was in a position to make . Time and again , they propel us into the future . That is why I proposed the American Jobs Plan , a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself . This is the largest jobs plan since World War II . It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure ; jobs modernizing our roads , bridges , highways ; jobs building ports and airports , rail corridors , transit lines . It is clean water . And , today , up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 schools and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them , including for drinking water -- a clear and present danger to our children 's health . The American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100 percent of the Nation 's lead pipes and service lines so every American can drink clean water . And , in the process , it will create thousands and thousands of good-paying jobs . It creates jobs connecting every American with high- speed internet , including 35 percent of rural America that still does n't have it . It is going to help our kids and our businesses succeed in the 21st century economy . I am asking the Vice President to lead this effort , if she would , because I know it will get done . It creates jobs by building a modern power grid . Our grids are vulnerable to storms , hacks , catastrophic failures , with tragic results , as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during the winter storms . The American Jobs Plan will create jobs to lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid . We can do that . Look , the American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and back to their careers . Two million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic , 2 million , and too often because they could n't get the care they needed to care for their child , or care for an elderly parent who needs help . 800,000 families are on a Medicare waiting list right now to get home care for their aging parent or loved one with a disability . If you think it is not important , check out in your own district , Democrat or Republican , Democrat or Republican voters . Their great concern , almost as much as the children , is taking care of an elderly loved one who ca n't be left alone . Medicaid contemplated it , but this plan is going to help those families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits , continuing the cycle of growth . For too long we have failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis : Jobs . Jobs . Jobs . For me , when I think climate change , I think jobs . The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy- efficient buildings and homes , electrical workers , IBEW members , installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways , so we can own the electric car market . Farmers ; farmers planting cover crops so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it . Look , think about it . There is simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines ca n't be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing . No reason . None . No reason . So , folks , there is no reason why American workers ca n't lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries . I mean , there is no reason . We have the capacity . We have the brightest , best-trained people in the world . The American Jobs Plan is going to create millions of good-paying jobs , jobs Americans can raise a family on , as my dad would then say , with a little breathing room . And all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle : Buy American . Buy American . And I might note parenthetically , that does not violate any trade agreement . It has been the law since the 1930s . Buy American . American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America to create American jobs . That is the way it is supposed to be , and it will be in this administration . And I made it clear to all my Cabinet people . Their ability to give exemptions has been strenuously limited . It will be American products . Now , I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you . So many of you , so many of the folks I grew up with , feel left behind , forgotten , and our economy is so rapidly changing . It is frightening . I want to speak directly to you , because you think about it . That is what people are most worried about : Can I fit in ? Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in economic growth in the years to come . It is an 8-year program . These are good-paying jobs that ca n't be outsourced . Nearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree . 75 percent do n't require an Associate 's degree . The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America . That is what it is . And it recognizes something I have always said in this Chamber and the [ [ Page H2120 ] ] other . Good guys and women are on Wall Street , but Wall Street did n't build this country ; the middle class built the country , and unions built the middle class . So that is why I am calling on Congress to pass the Protect the Right to Organize Act , the PRO Act , and send it to my desk so we can support the right to unionize . And , by the way , while you are thinking about sending things to my desk , let 's raise the minimum wage to $ 15 . No one , no one working 40 hours a week , no one working 40 hours a week should live below the poverty line . We need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women . And while we are doing this , let 's get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk as well . Equal pay . It has been much too long . And if you wonder whether it has been too long , look behind me . And , finally , the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in non-defense research and development on record . We will see more technological change , and some of you know more about this than I do . We will see more technological change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50 . That is how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more is changing . And we are falling behind the competition with the rest of the world . Decades ago , we used to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in America , 2 percent of our gross domestic product in research and development . Today , Mr. Secretary , that is less than 1 percent . China and other countries are closing in fast . We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future ; advanced batteries , biotechnology , computer chips , clean energy . The Secretary of Defense can tell you , and those of you who work on national security issues know , the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA , the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency , the people who set up before I came here , and that has been a long time ago , to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security . That is their only job , and it is a semi-separate agency . It is part of the Defense Department . It has led to everything from the discovery of the internet to GPS and so much more . It has enhanced our security . The National Institutes of Health , the NIH , I believe , should create a similar advanced research projects agency for health , and here is what it would do . It would have a singular purpose : To develop breakthroughs to prevent , detect , and treat diseases like Alzheimer 's , diabetes , and cancer . I will still never forget when we passed the cancer proposal in the last year I was Vice President , almost $ 9 million going to NIH . And if you excuse the point of personal privilege , I will never forget you standing , Mitch , and saying to name it after my deceased son . It meant a lot . So many of us have deceased sons , daughters , and relatives who died of cancer . I can think of no more worthy investment . I know of nothing that is more bipartisan . So let 's end cancer as we know it . It is within our power . It is within our power to do it . Investments in jobs and infrastructure like the ones we are talking about have often had bipartisan support in the past . Vice President Harris and I met regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the American Jobs Plan . I applaud the group of Republican Senators who just put forward their own proposal . So let 's get to work . I wanted to lay out before the Congress my plan before we got into deep discussions . I like to meet with those who have ideas that are different , that are better . I welcome those ideas , but the rest of the world is not waiting for us . I just want to be clear . From my perspective , doing nothing is not an option . Look , we ca n't be so busy competing with one another that we forget the competition that we have with the rest of the world to win the 21st century . Secretary Blinken can tell you , I spent a lot of time with President Xi . I traveled over 17,000 miles with him . I spent over 24 hours in private discussions with him . When he called to congratulate me , we had a 2-hour discussion . He is deadly earnest about becoming the most significant , consequential nation in the world . He and others , autocrats , think that democracy ca n't compete in the 21st century with autocracies because it takes too long to get a consensus . To win that competition for the future , in my view , we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families and our children . That is why I have introduced the American Families Plan tonight , which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families and , in turn , America . The first is access to good education . When this Nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century , it made us the best- educated , best-prepared Nation in the world . I believe it is the overwhelming reason that propelled us to where we got in the 20th century , but the world has caught up , or catching up . They are not waiting . I would say , parenthetically , if we were sitting down , if we have set a bipartisan committee together and said , okay , we are going to decide what we do in terms of the government providing for free education , I wonder whether we would think , as we did in the 20th century , that 12 years is enough in the 21st century . I doubt it . Twelve years is no longer enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st century . That is why my American Families Plan guarantees an additional 4 years of public education for every person in America , starting as early as we can . The great universities in this country have conducted studies over the last 10 years . They show that adding 2 years of universal , high- quality preschool for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old , no matter what background they come from , puts them in the position to be able to compete all the way through 12 years , and increases exponentially their prospect of graduating and going beyond graduation . Research shows when a young child goes to school , not daycare , they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go to college , or something after high school . When you add 2 years of free community college on top of that , you begin to change the dynamic . We can do that . And we will increase Pell grants and invest in historically Black colleges and universities , Tribal colleges , minority-serving institutions . The reason is , they do n't have the endowments , but their students are just as capable of learning about cybersecurity , just as capable of learning about metallurgy , all the things that provide those jobs of the future . Jill is a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady . If I have heard it once , I have heard it a thousand times . She has long said that , Joe , any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us . She will be deeply involved in leading this effort . Thank you , Jill . The second thing is , the American Families Plan will provide access to quality , affordable childcare . I am proposing legislation . We guarantee that low- and middle-income families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5 . The most hard-pressed working families wo n't have to spend a dime . Third , the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave and medical leave , family medical leave . We are one of the few industrial countries in the world . No one should have to choose between a job and a paycheck , or taking care of themselves and their loved ones , or parent , or spouse , or child . Fourth , the American Families Plan puts money directly into the pockets of millions of Americans . In March , we expanded a tax credit for every child in the family , up to $ 3,000 per child over 6 years of age , and $ 3,600 for children under 6 years of age . With two parents , two kids , that is $ 7,200 in the pockets to help take care of your family . That will help more than 65 million children , and help cut childcare poverty in half . We can afford it . So we did that in the last piece of legislation we passed , but let 's extend that childcare tax credit at least through the end of 2025 . The American Rescue Plan lowered healthcare premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act . I know that is really popular on this side of the aisle , but let 's make that provision permanent so their premiums do n't go back up . In addition to my American Families Plan , I am going to work with Congress [ [ Page H2121 ] ] this year to address other critical priorities for American families . The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans , protecting people with preexisting conditions and protecting women 's health . And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly it is needed . Let 's lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care Act , and let 's lower prescription drug costs . We know how to do this . The last President had that as his objective . We all know how outrageously expensive drugs are in America . In fact , we pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world right here in America . We pay nearly three times for the same drug as what other countries pay . We have to change that , and we can . Let 's do what we have talked about for all the years I was down here in this body , in Congress . Let 's give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower prescription drug prices . By the way , that wo n't just help people on Medicare . It will lower prescription drug costs for everyone . And the money we save , which is billions of dollars , can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare coverage and benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny . It is within our power to do it . Let 's do it now . We have talked about it long enough , Democrats and Republicans . Let 's get it done this year . This is all about a simple premise : Healthcare should be a right , not a privilege , in America . So , how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plans ? I have made it clear that we can do it without increasing deficits . Let 's start with what I will not do . I will not impose any tax increases on people making less than $ 400,000 a year . It is time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to begin to pay their fair share -- just pay their fair share . Sometimes , I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party . I think you should be able to become a billionaire and a millionaire but pay your fair share . A recent study shows that 55 of the Nation 's biggest corporations paid zero Federal income tax last year . Those 55 corporations made in excess of $ 40 billion in profits . A lot of companies also evade taxes through tax havens from Switzerland to Bermuda to the Cayman Islands , and they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions that allow for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas . That is not right . We are going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from as well . We are going to reward work , not just wealth . We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans , those making over $ 400,000 or more , back up to where it was when George W. Bush was President , when he started , 39.6 percent . That is where it was when George W. Bush was President . We are going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than $ 1 million a year to pay a lower rate on their capital gains than working Americans who receive a paycheck . We are only going to affect three-tenths of 1 percent of all Americans by that action . And the IRS is going to crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes . That is estimated to be billions of dollars by think tanks from the left , right , and center . I am not looking to punish anybody , but I will not add an additional tax burden to the middle class in this country . They are already paying enough . I believe what I have proposed is fair . It is fiscally responsible . It raises the revenue to pay for the plans I have proposed that will create millions of jobs that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing of the country . When you hear someone say that they do n't want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent and on corporate America , ask them : Whose taxes are you going to raise instead , and whose are you going to cut ? Look at the big tax cut in 2017 . Remember , it was supposed to pay for itself -- that was how it was sold -- and generate vast economic growth . Instead , it added $ 2 trillion to the deficit . It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top . Instead of using the tax savings to raise wages and invest in research and development , it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs . In fact , the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history . According to one study , CEOs make 320 times what their average workers make . It used to be below 100 . The pandemic has only made things worse . Twenty million Americans lost their jobs in the pandemic -- working- and middle-class Americans . At the same time , the roughly 650 billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $ 1 trillion in the same exact period . Let me say that again : Just 650 people increased their wealth by more than $ 1 trillion during this pandemic . And they are now worth more than $ 4 trillion . My fellow Americans , trickle-down economics has never worked . It is time to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out . A broad consensus of economists left , right , and center agree that what I am proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth . These are among the highest value investments we can make as a nation . I have often said that our greatest strength is the power of our example , not just the example of our power . In my conversations with world leaders , and I have spoken to over 38 or 40 of them now , I have made it known that America is back . The comment I hear most often from them is : We see America is back , but for how long ? My fellow Americans , we have to show not just that we are back but that we are here to stay and that we are n't going to go it alone . We are going to do it by leading with our allies . No one nation can deal with all the crises of our time alone , from terrorism to nuclear proliferation to mass migration , cybersecurity , climate change , and , as we are experiencing now , pandemics . There is no wall high enough to keep any virus away . As our own vaccine supply grows to meet our needs -- and we are meeting them -- we will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries , just as America was the arsenal of democracy in World War II and , as a consequence , influenced the world . Every American will have access to be fully covered by the vaccines we have for COVID-19 . The climate crisis is not our fight alone , either . It is a global fight . The United States accounts for , as all of you know , less than 15 percent of carbon emissions . The rest of the world accounts for 85 percent . That is why I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris accord because if we do everything perfectly , it is not going to matter . I kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America with all the major economies of the world , from China and Russia to India and the European Union . I said I would do it in my first 100 days . I want to be very blunt about it : My intent was to make sure that the world could see that there was a consensus and that we are at an inflection point in history . The consensus is if we act , we can save the planet , and we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living for almost everyone around the world . If you watched any of it -- and you were all busy ; I am sure you did n't have much time -- that is what virtually every nation said , even the ones that are n't doing their fair share . The investments I have proposed tonight also advance a foreign policy , in my view , that benefits the middle class . That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy , including China . In my discussion with President Xi , I told him we welcome the competition . We are not looking for conflict , but I made absolutely clear that we will defend America 's interests across the board . America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and American industries , like subsidies for state-owned enterprises and the theft of American technologies and intellectual property . I also told President Xi that we will maintain a strong military presence in the Indo-Pacific just as we do with [ [ Page H2122 ] ] NATO in Europe ; not to start a conflict , but to prevent one . I told him what I have said to many world leaders , that America will not back away from our commitments -- our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms and to our alliances . I pointed out to him , no responsible American President can remain silent when basic human rights are being so blatantly violated . An American President has to represent the essence of what our country stands for . America is an idea , the most unique idea in history . We are created , all of us , equal . It is who we are . We can not walk away from that principle and , in fact , say we are dealing with the American idea . With regard to Russia , I know it concerns some of you , but I made it very clear to President Putin that we are not going to seek escalation , but their actions will have consequences if they turn out to be true , and they turned out to be true . So I responded directly and proportionately to Russia 's interference in our elections and the cyber attacks on our government and our businesses . They did both of these things . I told them we would respond , and we have . But we can also cooperate when it is in our mutual interests . We did it when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms , and we are working to do it on climate change . But he understands , we will respond . On Iran and North Korea , nuclear programs that present serious threats to America 's security and the security of the world , we are going to be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through diplomacy , as well as stern deterrence . And American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan . We have , without hyperbole , the greatest fighting force in the history of the world . I am the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have a son serving in a war zone . Today we have servicemembers serving in the same war zone as their parents did . We have servicemembers in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11 . The war in Afghanistan , as we remember the debates here , was never meant to be a multi-generational undertaking of nation-building . We went to Afghanistan to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 . We said we would follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell to do it . If you have been in the Upper Kunar Valley , you have kind of seen the gates of hell . We delivered justice to Osama bin Laden , and we degraded the terrorist threat of al-Qaida in Afghanistan . After 20 years of American valor and sacrifice , it is time to bring those troops home . Even as we do , we will maintain an over-the-horizon capability to suppress future threats to the homeland . But make no mistake , in 20 years , terrorism has metastasized . The threat has evolved way beyond Afghanistan . Those of you on the Intelligence Committees , the Foreign Relations Committee , the Defense Committees , you know well we have to remain vigilant against the threats to the United States , wherever they come from . Al-Qaida and ISIS are in Yemen , Syria , Somalia , and other places in Africa and the Middle East and beyond . And we wo n't ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today , white supremacist terrorism . We are not going to ignore that either . My fellow Americans , we have to come together to heal the soul of this Nation . It was nearly a year ago , before her father 's funeral , when I spoke with Gianna Floyd , George Floyd 's young daughter . She is a little tyke , so I was kneeling down to talk to her so I could look her in the eye . She looked at me and said , `` My daddy changed the world . '' Well , after the conviction of George Floyd 's murderer , we can see how right she was , if we have the courage to act as a Congress . We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black Americans . Now is our opportunity to make some real progress . The vast majority of men and women wearing the uniform and a badge serve our communities , and they serve them honorably . I know them . I know they want to help meet this moment as well . My fellow Americans , we have to come together to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve ; to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system ; and to enact police reform in George Floyd 's name that passed the House already . I know Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in very productive discussions with Democrats in the Senate . We need to work together to find a consensus . Let 's get it done next month , by the first anniversary of George Floyd 's death . The country supports this reform , and Congress should act . We have a giant opportunity to bend the arc of the moral universe toward justice , real justice . With the plans I outlined tonight , we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues America and American lives in other ways ; a chance to deliver real equity , good jobs , good schools , affordable housing , clean air , clean water ; being able to generate wealth and pass it down through generations because you have access to purchase a house ; real opportunities in the lives of more Americans -- Black , White , Latino , Asian Americans , Native Americans . I also want to thank the United States Senate for voting 94-1 to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders . They acted decisively . You can see on television the viciousness of the hate crimes we have seen over the past year and for too long . I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk , which I will gladly , anxiously sign . I also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect LGBTQ Americans . To all the transgender Americans watching at home , especially the young people who are so brave , I want you to know that your President has your back . Another thing : Let 's reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act , which has been law for 27 years . Twenty-seven years ago , I wrote it . The act that has to be reauthorized now will close the boyfriend loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers . The court order said this is an abuser . You ca n't own a gun . It is to close that loophole that existed . It is estimated that 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month in America ; fifty a month . Let 's pass it and save some lives . I need not tell anyone this , but gun violence has become an epidemic in America . Our flag at the White House was still flying at half-mast for the 8 victims of the mass shooting in Georgia , when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado . In the week in between those two events , 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America . 250 shot dead . I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue . In the 1990s , we passed universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired in seconds . We beat the NRA . Mass shootings and gun violence declined . Check out the report over 10 years . But in the early 2000s , that law expired , and we have seen daily bloodshed since . I am not saying if the law continued , we would n't see bloodshed . More than 2 weeks ago in the Rose Garden , surrounded by some of the bravest people I know -- the survivors and families who have lost loved ones to gun violence -- I laid out several of the Department of Justice actions that are being taken to end this epidemic . One of them is banning so-called `` ghost guns . '' They are homemade guns built from a kit that includes directions on how to finish the firearm . The parts have no serial numbers , so when they show up at crime scenes , they ca n't be traced . The buyers of these ghost gun kits are n't required to pass a background check . Anyone from a criminal to a terrorist could buy this kit and , within 30 minutes , have a weapon that is lethal . But not anymore . I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence . But it is time for Congress to act as well . I do n't want to become confrontational , but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of the Democratic colleagues and close the loopholes and require background checks to [ [ Page H2123 ] ] purchase guns , and we need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines . Do n't tell me it ca n't be done . We did it before , and it worked . Talk to most responsible gun owners and hunters , and they will tell you there is no possible justification for having 100 rounds in a weapon . What do you think , deer are wearing kevlar vests ? They will tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun , but who should n't be able to buy a gun . These kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support of the American people , including many gun owners . The country supports reform , and Congress should act . This should n't be a red or blue issue . And no amendment to the Constitution is absolute . You ca n't yell `` fire '' in a crowded theater . From the very beginning , there were certain guns , weapons that could not be owned by Americans . Certain people could not own those weapons ever . We are not changing the Constitution . We are being reasonable . I think this is not a Democratic or Republican issue . I think it is an American issue . And here is what else we can do : Immigration has always been essential to America . Let 's end our exhausting war over immigration . For more than 30 years , politicians have talked about immigration reform , and we have done nothing about it . It is time to fix it . On day one of my Presidency , I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration bill to the United States Congress . If you believe we need to secure the border , pass it , because it has a lot of money for high-tech border security . If you believe in a pathway to citizenship , pass it so over 11 million undocumented folks -- the vast majority who are here overstaying visas -- pass it . If you actually want to solve a problem , I have sent a bill to take a close look at it . We also have to get at the root problem of why people are fleeing , particularly to our southern border , from Guatemala , Honduras , and El Salvador . The violence . The corruption . The gangs . The political instability . Hunger . Hurricanes . Earthquakes . Natural disasters . When I was Vice President , the President asked me to focus on providing the help needed to address the root causes of migration . It helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave . The plan was working , but the last administration decided it was not worth it . I am restoring the program , and I asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic effort to take care of this . I have absolute confidence she will get the job done . If you do n't like my plan , let 's at least pass what we all agree on . Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for Dreamers , the young people who have only known America as their home ; and permanent protections for immigrants who are here on temporary protected status , who come from countries beset by man-made and natural-made violent and disasters ; as well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables . Immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our history . The country supports immigration reform . Congress should act . Let 's argue over it . Let 's debate it . But let 's act . And if we truly want to restore the soul of America , we need to protect the sacred right to vote . More people voted in the last Presidential election than any time in American history -- in the middle of the worst pandemic ever . That should be celebrated . Instead , it is being attacked . Congress should pass H.R . 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send it to my desk right away . The country supports it , and Congress should act now . In conclusion , as we gather here tonight , the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol -- desecrating our democracy -- remain vivid in our minds . Lives were put at risk , many of your lives . Lives were lost . Extraordinary courage was summoned . The insurrection was an existential crisis -- a test on whether our democracy could survive . It did . But the struggle is far from over . The question of whether our democracy will long endure is both ancient and urgent . As old as our Republic . Still vital today . Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us -- created equal in the image of God -- have a chance to lead lives of dignity , respect , and possibility ? Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people ? Can our democracy overcome the lies , anger , hate , and fears that have pulled us apart ? America 's adversaries -- the autocrats of the world -- are betting we ca n't . And I promise you they are betting we ca n't . They believe we are too full of anger and division of rage . They look at the images of the mob that assaulted the Capitol as proof that the Sun is setting on American democracy . They are wrong . You know it . I know it . We have to prove them wrong . We have to prove democracy still works , that our government still works , and we can deliver for our people . In our first 100 days together , we have acted to restore people 's faith in democracy to deliver . We are vaccinating the Nation . We are creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs . We are delivering real results to people . They can see it and feel it in their own lives . Opening doors of opportunity , guaranteeing fairness and justice , that is the essence of America . That is democracy in action . Our Constitution opens with the words , as trite as it sounds , `` We the people . '' It is time to remember that we the people are the government . You and I . Not some force in a distant capital . Not some powerful force that we have no control over . It is us . It is `` We the people . '' In another era when our democracy was tested , Franklin Roosevelt reminded us : In America : we do our part . We all do our part . That is all I am asking . That we all do our part , all of us . If we do that , we will meet the central challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong . The autocrats will not win the future . We will . America will . The future belongs to America . I stand here tonight before you in a new and vital hour in the life of our democracy and our Nation . And I can say with absolute confidence : I have never been more confident or optimistic about America , not because I am President , but because of what is happening with the American people . We have stared into the abyss of insurrection and autocracy , of pandemic and pain , and `` We the people '' did not flinch . At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail , we came together . We united . With light and hope , we summoned new strength and new resolve to position us to win the competition for the 21st century on our way to a Union more perfect , more prosperous , and more just as one people , one Nation , and one America . Folks , as I told every world leader I have ever met with over the years , it has never , ever , ever been a good bet to bet against America , and it still is n't . We are the United States of America . There is not a single thing -- nothing -- beyond our capacity . We can do whatever we set our minds to if we do it together . So , let 's begin to get together . God bless you all , and may God protect our troops . Thank you for your patience .
