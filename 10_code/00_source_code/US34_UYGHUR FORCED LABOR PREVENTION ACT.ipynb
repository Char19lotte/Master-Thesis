      "MR. MEEKS . Mr. Speaker , I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill ( H.R . 1155 ) ensuring that goods made with forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People 's Republic of China do not enter the United States market , and for other purposes , as amended . General Leave Mr. MEEKS . Mr. Speaker , I ask unanimous consent that all Members [ [ Page H7499 ] ] have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R . 1155 . The SPEAKER pro tempore . Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York ? There was no objection . Mr. MEEKS . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . Mr. Speaker , I rise today in support of H.R . 1155 , the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act introduced by my good friend , colleague , and chairman of the Rules Committee , Mr. McGovern . Let me also thank Speaker Pelosi for bringing this crucial measure to the floor , and her unwavering dedication to human rights issues in China over the course of her public life . This necessary and bold measure reinforces this body 's commitment to our values by responding to the PRC 's human rights violations and imposing concrete costs on the PRC for the use of Uyghur forced labor . Since 2017 , the People 's Republic of China has systematically carried out mass detention , torture , political indoctrination , restrictions on religious attractions , and inhumane atrocities against Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang . We have seen the People 's Republic of China expand its extensive program of repression and transform it into a system of state-sponsored forced labor . Under the guise of vocational training or poverty alleviation , authorities in Xinjiang have forced thousands of adults and children to work against their will and under threat of punishment to produce goods and raw materials that are then woven into international supply chains and into our homes . According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum , it has been conservatively estimated that more than 80,000 Uyghurs were transferred out of Xinjiang to work in factories across China between the years of 2017 and 2019 , with some of them being sent directly from detention centers . Some analysts estimate that over 100,000 ex-detainees in Xinjiang are working in conditions of forced labor today . I have seen firsthand the benefits of the American companies engaging in China . Most American companies pay above-market wages and have better corporate social responsibility practices than their domestic counterparts . It would be inconsistent with core and crucial American values for this body not to take a stand against forced labor , and to stand up for the persecuted Uyghurs . Many brave companies have already spoken out and made ethical choices detrimental to their bottom line , and this bill ensures that corporate actors that have lived their values are not at a competitive disadvantage in the American marketplace . This bill , which has passed the House before , prohibits the import of goods and merchandise from Xinjiang unless the importer can prove the products did not come from forced labor , imposes sanctions on officials facilitating the use of forced labor against Chinese ethnic minorities , adds important financial disclosures for public companies that do business in the region , and calls for a diplomatic strategy to address forced labor in Xinjiang . This is a straightforward bill . It signals that forced labor has no place on this planet . It signals that products made using forced labor in Xinjiang have no place in the American marketplace . In 2021 , for any country to utilize forced labor systematically and to oppress and exploit a population is simply unconscionable . With the passage of this bipartisan measure , the House would hold accountable those responsible for perpetrating these heinous crimes that have irrevocably threatened the lives of over 1.8 million Uyghurs and Muslim minorities in Xinjiang and ensure Americans and American companies are not complicit in the Chinese Communist Party 's human rights atrocities . This legislation is critical to showing that we are putting human rights at the center of our foreign policy and economic policy . Mr. Speaker , I support and urge my colleagues to do the same . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. McCAUL . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . Mr. Speaker , I want to start by thanking Chairman Meeks and Chairman McGovern for bringing this important human rights legislation to this floor . It is high time . I want to start this debate with the simple truth that we can not afford to forget . Truly , free trade can not involve slave labor . Today , the Chinese Communist Party is using the forced labor of the Uyghurs and other minorities to help bankroll its genocide against these very same groups . { time } 1330 The repression taking place right now in Xinjiang is breathtaking in its scope and its brutality . It involves the detention of more than 1 million people in concentration camps . It also involves surveillance and intensive brainwashing on a massive scale . It involves breaking up families and taking children from their parents . And it involves forced sterilization and forced abortions . This should be a terrifying warning not only to China 's neighbors and to the American people but also to the world . The Chinese Communist Party is fundamentally focused on expanding its power and its authoritarian style of government . It views things that it does not control , like religion , cultural identity , and the yearning of all people for freedom , as threats that must be destroyed . Because we have drawn the CCP into many of our most critical supply chains , it has the ability to hold our national security hostage while it uses U.S. consumers to subsidize its atrocities . As many as one in five cotton garments globally are potentially tainted with Uyghur slave labor . Last year alone , U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized a 13-ton shipment of human hair that originated in Xinjiang 's forced labor system . It is brazen , and it is sickening . We must refuse to be complicit in the CCP 's genocide against the Uyghurs , and for that reason , I support the measure before us today . I wish we could have taken this up earlier . After sending a letter to the Speaker , we are finally at the day where we are now . Last Congress , this legislation went straight to the floor . Two weeks ago , 10 members of the Foreign Affairs Committee joined me in a letter urging the Speaker to move this bill . I am grateful that our message was received . But we could send this legislation to the President 's desk today by taking up the Senate version . Instead , we are setting this bill up for further legislative gridlock by passing a conflicting version , although I do applaud Chairman McGovern 's efforts in this issue . Mr. Speaker , going forward , I hope the majority in both Chambers will move this to final passage regardless of pressure from the administration to not advance the American values we all share . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. MEEKS . Mr. Speaker , I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from the great State of Massachusetts ( Mr. McGovern ) , the sponsor of this bill . Mr. McGOVERN . Mr. Speaker , I want to thank Chairman Meeks for yielding me the time and for his incredible leadership on this issue . I also want to thank Ranking Minority Member McCaul for his leadership . Mr. Speaker , many products used every day by people all over our country , including clothing , food , and shoes , are made using forced labor , the forced labor of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities held by the Chinese Government across a network of internment camps . It has been illegal to import forced labor products into the United States for more than 90 years , but it is exceedingly difficult to spot them since Chinese producers often mix together products that are the result of both involuntary and voluntary labor . Moreover , the lack of Chinese Government transparency and the police state atmosphere in Xinjiang make auditing of product sourcing unreliable if not impossible , according to the administration 's `` Xinjiang Supply Chain Business Advisory . '' Mr. Speaker , the imperative to act is clear . This is not a partisan issue . It is a human rights issue . It is a moral issue . There is already strong , diverse , bipartisan , and bicameral support for [ [ Page H7500 ] ] this legislation on both sides of the Capitol . That includes my colleagues on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China , Representative Chris Smith and Senator Marco Rubio , the author of the Senate bill . I , too , want to especially thank Speaker Nancy Pelosi for her longtime advocacy for human rights in China and for her leadership in getting this bill to the House floor today . I want to thank Chairman Richard Neal , Chairman Gregory Meeks , and Chairwoman Maxine Waters for their support in their committees . The House of Representatives passed this bill in September 2020 by a vote of 406-3 , but , sadly , the Senate did nothing . It never took it up . The Senate now passed a version of this bill in July . It is time for us to get this done . Two years ago , the Congressional-Executive Commission on China , of which I serve as the co-chair , held a hearing and an expert roundtable and issued a groundbreaking staff report . This legislation would not be possible without the hardworking staff of that Commission . Our findings of systematic and widespread forced labor in Xinjiang are based on testimony from camp detainees , satellite imagery of factories being built at internment camps , and public and leaked Chinese Government documents . Forced labor was one of the justifications cited by the State Department , first by Secretary Pompeo and then reiterated by Secretary Blinken , in determining that the Chinese Government was committing genocide against Uyghurs and members of other Muslim ethnic minority groups . Forced labor was listed by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in its November 2021 report finding that the Chinese Government had committed crimes against humanity in Xinjiang . The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act prohibits imports from Xinjiang to the U.S. by creating a rebuttable presumption that all goods produced in the region are made with forced labor unless U.S. Customs and Border Protection certifies by clear and convincing evidence that goods were not produced with forced labor . Mr. Speaker , in 2 months , the Chinese Government will host the Winter Olympics in the middle of a genocide . This is unconscionable . We asked the International Olympic Committee to postpone and move the games . They refused . Instead , the IOC made ANTA , a Chinese company implicated in slave labor , its official sportswear uniform supplier . I am pleased that the Biden administration has decided not to send American diplomats to the Olympics , but Congress needs to do its part by passing this bill before the Olympics start . We must take a clear moral position to stand with those who are suffering from forced labor and not with the Chinese Government , the IOC , and the big corporations who profit off the exploitation of slave labor . Shame on them . No more business as usual . We must pass and put into law the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act . I urge all of my colleagues to support this . If the United States of America stands for anything , we need to stand out loud and four-square for human rights . Mr. McCAUL . Mr. Speaker , I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey ( Mr. Smith ) , the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa , Global Health , and Global Human Rights . He also is the co-chair of the China Commission and has been a champion for human rights in China for three decades . Mr. SMITH of New Jersey . Mr. Speaker , I thank my good friend for yielding . I thank Mr. McCaul for his extraordinary leadership on China , including his Commission that has made many , many recommendations . I want to thank Chairman Meeks for his leadership as well and , of course , Chairman McGovern , with whom I have worked on this bill , for his leadership . Mr. Speaker , I chaired a Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission hearing in May titled `` China , Genocide and the Olympics , '' which helped further underscore why H.R . 1155 , the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act , which I have cosponsored with Jim McGovern , is so important and so necessary . At that hearing , we heard testimony from Rayhan Asat , whose brother , Ekpar , a Muslim Uyghur , at last report is still incarcerated in a concentration camp in Xinjiang . Ekpar is a tech entrepreneur , media founder , and philanthropist who won recognition both inside of China and outside . Indeed , our State Department thought so highly of him that he was part of the International Visitors Leadership Program . But upon his return , because he was a Muslim Uyghur , the Chinese authorities arrested him and disappeared him into a concentration camp where he has remained for 5\\1/2\\ years . What happens , Mr. Speaker , to those swallowed up in these horrific concentration camps ? That is something we heard about in another Lantos Commission hearing this past July where Gulzira , a survivor , told us what goes on each and every day . In addition to her horrific , firsthand description of unspeakable physical abuse , organized forced prostitution , rape , and every gross violation of human rights imaginable , she also gave a firsthand account of a forced labor factory in which she made gloves for export for 1\\1/2\\ years . Gulzira is one of the lucky ones because she was released when Radio Free Asia broadcast her plight to the world . Mr. Speaker , there are millions of stories like hers waiting to be told , truly nightmarish accounts of President Xi Jinping 's genocide . And make no mistake about it , this is Xi Jinping 's genocide . He is personally responsible for having ordered it . The rape and sexual abuse of women being held in so-called internment camps , forced abortion , and involuntary sterilization to prevent the birth of Uyghur children are in direct violation of Article II ( d ) of the U.N. Genocide Convention , which states in part that genocide includes imposing measures intended to prevent births within a group . Forced labor on a massive scale that allows Chinese companies to profit -- and profit big time -- from modern-day slavery is also absolutely pervasive in Xinjiang . Documents obtained by The New York Times and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists exposed just how cruel these plans are , originating , again , with Xi Jinping himself who early next year will be hosting the Olympic Games , which is outrageous . The leaked documents show how Xi directed the crackdowns , saying that the Communist Party must put the `` organs of dictatorship '' to work and show `` absolutely no mercy '' in dealing with Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities . In one speech , President Xi said : `` The weapons of the people 's democratic dictatorship must be wielded without any hesitation or wavering . '' Mr. Speaker , I am deeply concerned by a report from Josh Rogin in The Washington Post just last week stating how the Biden administration and Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman sought to undermine the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act , which passed the Senate last July and the House last Congress 406-3 . According to Josh Rogin : `` Biden administration officials have been quietly telling lawmakers to slow down . . . . Sherman made it clear that the administration prefers a more targeted and deliberative approach to determining which goods are the products of forced labor . '' Mr. Speaker , I include in the Record Josh Rogin 's column from The Washington Post , `` Opinion : Congress needs to act on Xi Jinping 's genocide now . '' Mr. SMITH of New Jersey . We have no access , Mr. Speaker , to the concentration camps in Xinjiang . We have no idea the supply chains . It is closed . It is a dictatorship . There are no onsite inspections . Again , we are talking genocide against these Muslims who are being wiped off the face of the Earth . The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act prohibits imports from Xinjiang to the United States by creating a rebuttable presumption . That is the core of this bill , that all goods produced in the region are made with forced labor unless U.S. Customs and Border Protection certifies by clear and convincing evidence that goods were not produced with forced labor . So the rebuttable presumption is the key to this legislation . It is very workable . As my good friend and colleague noted , cotton , solar panels , and so many other things are produced there . We need to know . We need to stop them from coming here . The SPEAKER pro tempore . The time of the gentleman has expired . Mr. McCAUL . Mr. Speaker , I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute . Mr. SMITH of New Jersey . Again , if these companies can prove that it is not made by forced labor , not made as part of this genocide , then it would be welcomed here . But we know that is unlikely to happen . My hope is that we will unite -- Republican and Democrat , Democrat and Republican -- around this bill and get it to the President as soon as humanly possible . Delay is denial . People are being slaughtered each and every day in Xinjiang , and we can do something , maybe not a whole lot , but something to mitigate and stop this . Mr. MEEKS . Mr. Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the great State of New York ( Mr. Suozzi ) , who is on the Ways and Means Committee . Mr. SUOZZI . Mr. Speaker , I thank the chairman and everyone who has worked so hard on this , including Chairman McGovern . Mr. Speaker , I stand before you as chair of the Congressional Uyghur Caucus and as a member of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China to support passage of the bipartisan Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act . We need to wake up from our torpor . It has been reported for years , but I do n't think most Americans realize exactly what is going on in China . It was almost 50 years ago that Nixon went to China , and we have always believed that the more the Chinese Government and the people were exposed to the United States and the West , our way of life , our democracy , and our economic system , the more they would become like us , the more they would adopt concepts of freedom of expression , free markets , and minority rights . Well , that simply has n't happened . Everyone in this body has seen reliable reports and clear documentation of crimes against humanity : forced labor , forced sterilization , mass surveillance , government-run detention camps , mass detention , sexual violence , and torture against the Uyghur people . { time } 1345 The Chinese Communist Party is even forcing people to eat pork during Ramadan , even though it violates people 's religion . It is hard to imagine that in today 's world , that forced labor camps are happening , and we know about it . And today , we are standing up to do something about it . The Chinese Communist Party must be held accountable . We have rules in place now that say you ca n't use forced labor . But this bill is a major step forward in mandating that everything that comes out of Xinjiang in China will be presumed to be using forced labor and , therefore , ineligible to be sold into the U.S. supply chain . This is going to have a tremendous impact . An overwhelming amount of cotton in the world comes from China , for example . Mr. Speaker , 84 percent of that cotton that comes from China comes from the Xinjiang region . Some people are going to say , Oh , my gosh , if we do n't do business with Xinjiang , then the cost of products are going to go up . Well , that is too damn bad . This should shock everyone 's conscience . The SPEAKER pro tempore . The time of the gentleman has expired . Mr. MEEKS . Mr. Speaker , I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds . Mr. SUOZZI . Mr. Speaker , we have to do everything we can to stand up for our values . The world is watching us , and it starts with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act becoming law . Let 's do this , and let 's do it together . We recognize here in our country that we went through a period of slavery . That is why it is so offensive to us now to see slavery actually happening in the world as we speak , where both administrations , the prior administration and this administration , have both said this is genocide . Standing up together in a bipartisan way is so important . Mr. McCAUL . Mr. Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee ( Mr. Burchett ) , a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs . Mr. BURCHETT . Mr. Speaker , I thank the Republican lead , Mr. McCaul , for yielding . And Chairman Meeks , you are a force in the House gymnasium . You are a force on the House floor , and I appreciate you , brother . The Chinese Communist Party does anything it can to get ahead of the United States , Mr. Speaker . It steals [ [ Page H7502 ] ] our intellectual property and uses Uyghur slave labor to manufacture products . It is threatening the freedom of folks from Taiwan to Hong Kong . Our government needs to stand up to them . Today , we are acknowledging some of the Chinese Communist Party 's horrible , horrible behaviors . It is not enough . Additional action is needed , Mr. Speaker . The Chinese Communist Party knows there are no consequences for its behavior . That needs to change . It starts with the Biden administration . They need to do more than just finger-wagging to effectively counter China . This administration needs to make it clear to the Chinese Communist Party that bad behavior will be met with action , not empty words . President Biden also needs to set aside his climate agenda when addressing the Chinese Communist Party . His administration tried to kill the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act because the Uyghurs mine the polysilicon for our solar panels . It is gross that this administration wants to let Uyghur slavery slide to advance its climate agenda . I am glad we have these bills on the floor today . It is a start , but more work needs to be done . I hope in the Foreign Affairs Committee , both parties can work together and hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable , Mr. Speaker . Mr. MEEKS . Mr. Speaker , I proudly yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the great State of Oregon ( Mr. Blumenauer ) . Mr. BLUMENAUER . Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the gentleman 's courtesy . Congress passed a law almost a century ago prohibiting the importation of goods made with forced labor . But , you know , it was really never enforced . That changed in 2016 , potentially , when we passed legislation to eliminate the consumptive demand loophole that allowed people a way around . Well , it is time that we finish the job . Nothing is more chilling than what the Chinese are doing to the Uyghur people . I have chaired meetings of our Trade Subcommittee that were really appalling . It is Orwellian in terms of what they are doing to detain Uyghurs in internment , re-education , slave labor camps ; that international concern the Chinese think will just remain on the sideline . Now , there are many American companies that are attempting to deal with this , but we need to do more . We need to strengthen their resolve , and we need to be able to get the attention of the Chinese Government . A stronger regime is absolutely necessary . Crimes against humanity require a response . We must not just vote our support for the Uyghur people and other minorities across China . We need to make sure that we are clear about who gets the benefit of the doubt . More than a million Uyghurs have been enslaved ; half of them forced to harvest cotton , one of the Xinjiang region 's largest exports . When American consumers buy a shirt , they should n't have questions about whether or not that was made with forced labor . I strongly support this legislation to ensure that American dollars are n't inadvertently contributing to forced labor . That is the language that the Chinese understand ; denying them access to our markets and making sure that people are responsible for their supply chain . This legislation , I think , is a great start . I am pleased that there is bipartisan support for it . I hope we enact it , and then we work together to make sure that it is enforced . Mr. McCAUL . Mr. Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina ( Mr. Rice ) , a member of the Committee on Ways and Means . Mr. RICE of South Carolina . Mr. Speaker , China is a global thief . We all know it . They steal American intellectual property . They steal American jobs using currency manipulation , illegal subsidies , and product dumping to kill American competition . And worst of all , they produce products with slave labor . Mr. Speaker , I rise today in support of H.R . 1155 , the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act . H.R . 1155 's central provision establishes a rebuttable presumption that all goods made in China 's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are produced with forced labor . Since 2017 , China has arbitrarily detained and persecuted over 1 million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in extrajudicial , mass re- education camps in Xinjiang . We know that China is seeking to profit from the oppression by subsidizing companies to build factories near these mass internment sites . H.R . 1155 leverages the power of our enormous market to send China a message that it can not use its policies of repression to subsidize its exports . We must work with our allies to ensure that all global markets are closed to the products of Chinese theft and repression . A core and essential provision of this bill is a rebuttable presumption that leads to an import prohibition . In 2016 , the Ways and Means Committee led the way on a bipartisan basis in eliminating the consumptive demand loophole from the outright ban on products made with forced labor in Section 307 of the 1930 Tariff Act . A few years later , we have worked with our USMCA partners to extend the U.S. ban on products produced with forced labor throughout North America . We are now leading the world in combating forced labor in Xinjiang . The SPEAKER pro tempore . The time of the gentleman has expired . Mr. McCAUL . Mr. Speaker , I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds . Mr. RICE of South Carolina . For that reason , we wish that our Democratic colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee had worked with us to update the bill from the version that passed 14 months ago to ensure that it establishes the most effective mechanism for blocking imports from Xinjiang , while providing much-needed clarity to facilitate trade by good actors . Just as importantly , we know that China has anticipated this ban by expanding this practice beyond Xinjiang . We need to work closely with our colleagues in the Senate to ensure that the version of the bill that becomes law can better assist importers to identify and proactively eradicate goods produced with forced labor from their supply chains , whether they arise in Xinjiang or in other locations . This bill is just the beginning , but it sends a strong signal to China that it can not launder its policies of persecution and repression in a global market . Mr. MEEKS . Mr. Speaker , I proudly yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the great State of Virginia ( Ms. Wexton ) . Ms. WEXTON . Mr. Speaker , I thank Chairman Meeks , Speaker Pelosi , and Chairman McGovern for bringing this important legislation to the floor and shining a light on the atrocities taking place in Xinjiang . I represent the largest Uyghur diaspora in the U.S. and this legislation is critically important to the Uyghur community . I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation that will prohibit the importation of goods from Xinjiang unless it can be proven by clear and convincing evidence that they were not made with forced labor . Despite international condemnation , the Chinese Government 's brutal campaign of repressive surveillance , mass detention , forced labor , and even genocide , is rapidly expanding , and we must take steps to ensure that U.S. companies and consumers are not complicit in the abuses . This legislation will hold the PRC accountable for these heinous acts and will make it clear that the U.S. will not turn a blind eye to the plight of the Uyghurs . I urge my colleagues to support this legislation . Mr. McCAUL . Mr. Speaker , I am prepared to close . I yield myself the balance of my time . Mr. Speaker , I know there is another bill by Senator Rubio . I hope this bill , when it passes , can be worked out in the Senate , and I hope the administration will not slow-roll this important measure , as has been reported . Out of this region we have batteries and solar panels . When Secretary John Kerry testified , he admitted that Xinjiang 's solar panel production presents a problem for U.S. climate strategy , and I agree with him . In recent years , the world has stood by as the Chinese Communist Party has detained more than 1 million ethnic minorities in concentration camps where they are tortured , brainwashed , and put into forced labor . This is all a [ [ Page H7503 ] ] part of a deliberate program by the CCP to wipe out their ethnic identity , their religion , and their culture , anything that might compete with the Communist Party for their loyalties and affection . We have a moral duty to speak out against these horrifying crimes ; but we have an even greater duty to avoid funding this genocide by paying for slave labor in Xinjiang . Many American companies have built their businesses on values that include respect for basic human rights . The United States must continue to lead the world in setting corporate responsibility standards . There can no longer be business as usual with China . China is watching and the world is watching . I support this bill , Mr. Speaker , and I yield back the balance of my time . Mr. MEEKS . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself the balance of my time . I am happy that this bipartisan effort dealing with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act is an opportunity for this body to send a resounding message to the world that we are engaged in a strategic competition with China around the world . And our stance on this issue , I believe , will define why our system is better . But I must reply to some comments . One , the comment that President Biden is holding us up . Well , I am the chair of this committee , he has never told me to hold up anything . In fact , he wants to move forward . In fact , it is President Biden who has sanctioned officials responsible for genocide and issued supply chain advisories in Xinjiang . The fact of the matter is , I think our bill is far superior . You go to the Senate side , the Senate says , this should take 300 days to stop . Our bill says 120 days . For me , this is a personal situation . So I would wish that some of my colleagues who , rightfully , want to make sure that we send a strong message to the world that we are not going to stand for genocide . We are not going to stand for slave labor . But it is best if they would join us about injustice in America . It is best if we fought together to make sure that when President Trump talked about a Muslim ban in the United States of America -- that was n't Joe Biden -- we ca n't do it in America . That is the best way to lead . { time } 1400 When we talk about moving , I want to condemn it everywhere . Dr. King said : Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere . We should lead by example collectively . We should lead by going forward with voting rights . We should lead by talking about reparations for those who were enslaved in America . We should lead by talking about the genocide that took place to Native Americans . We should lead by talking about the injustice in housing . We should lead by talking about civil rights . So we have got to come together and stop it everywhere , and that is what this bill does . It sends a strong message . I want to be that example . This just happens to be personal , so I had to say it . I do n't like to put politics in these things , but I do like to tell the truth . Mr. Speaker , we have got to work together . I want to thank especially Mr. McCaul . I have got to say this , too , in closing . I have got to say this in closing , because Mr. McCaul is my friend , and we work very closely together . I know his spirit and his heart , and he stands up . I look forward on this committee to continue to do that . Mr. Speaker , I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California ( Ms. Pelosi ) , the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives . Ms. PELOSI . Mr. Speaker , I salute the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee for his leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor . It is historic . I want to join him in saluting Mr. McCaul , who has been a champion for human rights . We have worked together for years on these subjects . I thank them both for their leadership . As has been recognized earlier , Mr. Speaker , this week marks a momentous milestone in human history . Seventy-three years ago tomorrow , the international community convened in Paris to approve the United Nations Genocide Convention . In doing so , the world forged an historic commitment to always condemn and combat the crime of genocide , which they had defined 2 years prior as : `` a denial of the right of existence , '' which `` shocks the conscience of mankind '' and is `` a matter of international concern . '' Today , in some ways , we are falling short on that promise . In its latest Human Rights Report , our own State Department has definitively declared that the barbaric oppression of the Uyghurs by the Government of China amounts to genocide . We salute the administration for that recognition . New research by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum sheds light on these crimes , with a survivor describing Beijing 's intentions as : `` to make us slowly disappear , so slowly that no one would notice . '' Indeed , the erasure of the Uyghurs is precisely the definition of genocide from three-quarters of a century ago . That is why , with the strong bipartisan package of legislation we will pass today , the House takes yet another bold , bipartisan step to counter these crimes against humanity . We are honoring the challenge to our conscience , and I thank Chairman Meeks and Ranking Member McCaul . Congress and the country are grateful to the relentless leaders of the legislation before us . At the helm of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China , as well as the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission , Chairman Jim McGovern has long served as a voice for the voiceless , not only in China , but around the world . With his Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act , we are taking decisive action against the exploitation of the Uyghur people . We are stepping up to the plate . I salute , again , Congressman Michael McCaul for a resounding resolution condemning the genocide of the Uyghurs in China . Thank you to Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton for her resolution demanding that Beijing immediately guarantee the safety and freedom of tennis star Peng Shuai . I also thank Chairman Gregory Meeks , Chairman Richard Neal , and Chairwoman Maxine Waters for their longstanding leadership in the House 's fight against forced labor . Together , this legislation , which we will pass today , makes unequivocally clear the House 's firm commitment to human rights in China and does so in a bipartisan way . That has always been the case over time . Chris Smith and I have been working on these issues for decades together , with others such as Frank Wolf , who was here before him , and with many others on both sides of the aisle . Right now , Beijing is orchestrating a brutal and accelerating campaign of repression against the Uyghur people and other Muslim minorities . In Xinjiang and across China , millions are enduring outrageous human rights abuses , from mass surveillance and discriminatory policing to mass torture , including solitary confinement and forced sterilization , to intimidation of journalists and activists who have dared to expose the truth . And the Chinese Government 's exploitation of forced labor reaches across the oceans to our shores and across the world . They always say that the most horrible form of torture to a prisoner , or somebody in one of these camps , is to say to them : Nobody knows you are even here ; nobody even cares about you . We want those people , the Uyghurs and others oppressed in China , to know that we do care about them , we know many of them by name , and we will never forget our responsibility to act upon the actions that the Chinese Government is engaged in . That is why the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act employs America 's great economic might to combat this brutality and hold the perpetrators accountable by blocking certain imports produced with forced labor , leveling sanctions against the perpetrators , and imposing disclosure requirements on companies engaged in Xinjiang . With this strong , bipartisan legislation , we are better able to fight forced labor , we shine a bright light on this pattern of abuse , and we send Beijing a clear message that this genocide must end now . [ [ Page H7504 ] ] As we focus on this genocide against the Uyghurs , we must also remember Beijing 's decades-long assault on human rights . Those of us who have long been in this fight for human rights in China have seen a regime of terror and repression that has only intensified : from Tibet to Taiwan ; to assaults on basic freedoms in Hong Kong and beyond ; to jailing of journalists and detaining of dissidents ; and more . In Congress , for decades , we have taken strong bipartisan actions fighting for human rights in China . That is why , in 1991 , Democrats and Republicans stood up together for free speech during a visit to Tiananmen Square just 2 years after the government 's infamous crackdown . That is why , in 1993 , in a bipartisan way , we convinced the world that China 's dismal record on human rights disqualified the nation from hosting the 2000 Olympic Games . That is why , in 2000 , I took to this floor to urge my colleagues to block China from the World Trade Organization , arguing that we should not put deals ahead of ideals . China has not honored the agreement . That is why , in 2015 , working together , we had a Congressional delegation to Tibet to see the aspirations in the eyes of the schoolchildren who have endured China 's and Beijing 's intimidation . That is why , in 2019 , working together , we sounded the alarms as the Chinese Government locked up pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong . Democrats and Republicans , House and Senate , have come together to enact strong policies standing up for human rights in China , including : the Tibet Policy and Support Act , the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act , and the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act ; all enacted into law , signed into law . For decades , many of us have fought against what they call normal trade relations with China , because , as the world 's strongest economy , America has a moral duty to tie our trade relations with human rights . When China joined the WTO 20 years ago this week , the world gave Beijing a blank check to prosper from its abuses while simply hoping it would change its behavior . Many of us knew then , as we still know today , that this approach was fated for failure . Today 's legislation will help right this wrong . We must respond with more than legislation . We must show leadership . As House Speaker , I applaud and support President Biden 's strong leadership in announcing there will be no official U.S. presence at the 2022 Winter Olympics . Allowing a country with an abysmal human rights record to host the games makes a mockery of the Olympic Charter , which states that the games should seek to foster `` respect for universal and fundamental ethical principles . '' Make no mistake : our athletes can and should be celebrated . But this year , we should celebrate them from home . They can be there ; we should be home . As noted , when I called for the diplomatic boycott last May , the world must not reward more than three decades of abusive and repressive actions by the Chinese Government by giving our official imprimatur to China . I thank Mr. McCaul for his leadership , particularly in calling out the Olympic Committee for making this choice . Mr. Speaker , today we have an opportunity to forge further progress in the fight for human rights in China , a fight that many of us have been extraordinarily proud to help lead over our careers in Congress . Mr. Speaker , if we do not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial or economic ties , we lose all moral authority to speak out against human rights violations anywhere in the world . We must never fail to live up to our sacred duty to safeguard the dignity and worth of every person and build a better future for generations to come . Proudly , this legislation , all of it -- Mr. McCaul 's , Mr. McGovern 's , and Ms. Wexton 's leadership , the leadership of the chairman , Mr. Meeks , and ranking member , Mr. McCaul , of the committee -- has earned overwhelming bipartisan support when we passed it in the House last year . I hope we will do so again this year . Mr. Speaker , I urge a strong vote for the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and the other legislation that is before us this afternoon and do so asking for a very strong bipartisan vote so that we know that we will have the numbers to send a message to the Chinese Government that this is bipartisan , bicameral , on both sides of the Capitol , and a view shared by the President of the United States . I ask for an `` aye '' vote all around . Mr. MEEKS . Mr. Speaker , I just have these last remarks . I also want to thank Mr. Smith . As indicated by the Speaker , from the time that I have been in Congress , his focus has been on human rights around the world . As the Speaker indicated , and as I indicated with Mr. McCaul and you will see coming up with these other bills , we have worked collectively , leaving politics out of it , focused on leading the world . That is what I look forward to , locking arms , sending that message around the world that we are not going to allow slave labor to flourish and to exist on this planet . Mr. Speaker , I yield back the balance of my time . Mr. BRADY . Mr. Speaker , ending forced labor -- and holding China accountable for these gross abuses of human rights -- must be a global effort . America should lead the world in halting China 's brutality , and all democracies around the world should join us . As I 've said many times , this is a completely bipartisan issue , as demonstrated by the overwhelming bipartisan vote in the House on a similar bill in September 2020 . The United States has no tolerance for China 's human rights abuses , in Xinjiang or anywhere . There are real challenges to further tighten the dragnet around China and force it to eliminate atrocities , while supporting legitimate trade . All of us agree : we want to create opportunities for our producers to comply with the law while removing forced labor from our global supply chains . And just as important , we must urge our trading partners to work with us . Inexplicably , this entirely bipartisan issue has been pushed to the back burner , with Democrats delaying consideration for 14 months . And Ways & Means did not mark this bill up or update the trade provisions in any way . This is difficult to understand , because a core provision of this bill , which is the rebuttable presumption that importation of goods made in Xinjiang must be blocked because they are made with forced labor , is clearly in our Committee 's jurisdiction . This issue is not only bipartisan . It 's bicameral . Both the House and the Senate have strong bills that send a clear and unequivocal message : the United States has zero tolerance for these abuses . While I 'm disappointed that this was delayed , taking strong action today is an important step . Republicans support strong and effective legislation that addresses China 's atrocities while supporting legitimate trade , and I look forward to working with the Senate to perfect our approach and enact this bill into law promptly . It is vital that we stop the scourge of modern-day slavery in China . { time } 1415 The SPEAKER pro tempore ( Mr. Espaillat ) .
