      "Joachim Kuhs , rapporteur . – Madam President , dear Commissioner Hahn ! Dear President Lehne - I do not see you , but maybe you are tuned in - ladies and gentlemen ! I had the honor of participating in the discharge procedure as a rapporteur and thus drafting the 2019 discharge report on the Commission budget . The discharge procedure is clearly laid down in Article 319 TFEU and Article 260 et seq . of the Financial Regulation . It is important to check that the EU funds are being used properly by those responsible for the budget and , if necessary , to finally release them from financial responsibility . My draft contained objective figures , calculations and explanations . I took up the pertinent points of criticism of the Court of Auditors – particularly in relation to cohesion . I criticized the unsatisfactory absorption rates and the absurdly high outstanding commitments of EUR 298 billion . The draft was also critical of irregularities in the disbursement of funds , for example to non-governmental organizations that support the glorification of Islamic terror or radicalization in the Middle East . I have suggested ways to improve control and transparency , as well as penalties and refunds , to avoid future irregularities and fraud . Unfortunately , the majority of colleagues in the committee and colleagues from other groups have completely distorted my report with ideological amendments : my report was only 60 pages long . With 840 amendments already in the Committee on Budgetary Control , it was inflated to 172 pages almost beyond recognition . With the amendments before you today , my objective and apolitical discharge report has finally degenerated into a political manifesto . For example : the word “ gender ” is now mentioned 76 times , the word “ climate ” 75 times ; the word `` irregularities '' unfortunately only 24 times and the word `` sanctions '' only twice - and the term `` zero tolerance for fraud '' exactly zero times . Gender mainstreaming , EU superstate , LGBT and climate change now feature prominently in the report . In the interest of the taxpayer , however , it would be important to emphasize how we avoid fraud , irregularities and illegal spending of the money of taxpayers - that would be in the interest of the taxpayer . So I ask myself : Why do you always and everywhere make gender mainstreaming politics , but do not really stand up for families ? Why do you see discrimination everywhere , but remain silent , embarrassed and caught , when it comes to the lives of unborn children ? Why do you actually propagate this EU civil religion instead of those virtues that have made Europe - not the EU - successful ? Dear colleagues ! What is all this about ? It is about a discharge report and not about a political manifesto , and it is about the budget of the EU Commission for 2019 , not about the new multi-annual financial framework or even about the so-called reconstruction fund or the Green Deal . Now I turn to you , Mr President Lehne , from the European Court of Auditors . What do you actually say about this development ? Your House has invested a lot of work in examining the budget of the EU Commission . This time you even created a – in my opinion – very helpful and meaningful performance report – thank you very much for that as well . And then the Court of Auditors finds some really serious shortcomings - and what happens ? Nothing ! Because many of my fellow Members of Parliament here are competing for the dubious award of who pays the least attention to your reports , President Lehne . I would also like to thank the hard-working staff in the CONT Committee Secretariat : thank you for your constructive support in the discharge procedure . However , I wonder what you must have been thinking when you had to reword hundreds of amendments into political compromise proposals . You do not have to do that otherwise , do you ? And what my colleague - whom I would also like to thank very much for her work - said about these amendments , I prefer not to repeat here . Dear colleagues ! The discharge of the EU Commission is a right that the EU Parliament has fought hard for . Now you are trampling on that right , so to speak . They make a collectivist communist manifesto out of the originally objective and subject-related exoneration report . This is a slap in the face to all hardworking people and taxpayers in the EU Member States . You are turning my report into a paper directed against nation states . They are calling for an ever narrower and more powerful EU . You are turning my report into a piece of paper aimed at homeowners and drivers , because the increase in `` climate-related spending '' will make construction costs , heating costs and fuel prices even more expensive . And finally : You are turning my report into a piece of paper that devalues ​​families . With your gender fanaticism you are deliberately and purposefully attacking many millions of families who want to live out Christian values ​​and virtues . None of this has anything to do with the original report I made . I will therefore , bound by my conscience and the will of my constituents , vote against this discharge report . "

You know this , because you are a convinced European , and you are in a delicate situation today , because you are here as the representative of a Council which , despite the request of Vice-President Jourová , despite the request of Mrs Hohlmeier , chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control , does not want to sit around the table . Simply sit at the table to discuss some 580 million euros , at a time when Europe needs to express its democracy , at a time when there are doubts about the use of the funds . For my part , I have none , because I know , thanks to information from the Commission and the Court of Auditors , that the money is a priori well managed within the Council , and I am delighted about that . But why must the Council remain the only European body to refuse to submit to the scrutiny and budgetary discharge of this Parliament ? I am very sorry because , as you know , I was already rapporteur during the previous legislature , for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , and already the same question arose . Why not at least discuss it ? I therefore turn to you : your mandate is not over , you are still President of the Council ; perhaps you could get the General Secretariat of the Council to sit down at the same table as the Commission and Parliament . This is a formal request that I make to you on behalf of the entire hemicycle . Because there is unanimity . We may not agree on everything , there may be legal debates - I am the first to admit that - but at least let us discuss , debate . Forgive me for addressing you directly , Mrs Zacarias , but I have confidence in you , because I heard you and I know what you think of the European Union and , moreover , I have no other interlocutor . Please get the General Secretariat of the Council to talk to Parliament and the Commission . For the rest , I will spare you and everyone else – so we can talk , I will not take my six minutes – the legal arguments , section 262 , all of that . You know it , we know it , it is more a question of principle , we are here in a ... no , I do not want to use a negative word , but let us say that we are not up to the level of the necessary democracy and transparency that Europe , that the European Union must show to all of its citizens and to the whole world . If you do not have the opportunity , at least perhaps , please take the time to read our resolution , since we are going to put this question off for another six months and we will be back in six months – and I hope that we will not come back to vote against , but to take note of the fact that everyone is finally getting around the table . So perhaps take the time to read our resolution , the resolution of the Parliament , because Parliament , through this resolution , is asking for progress in European democracy – for progress on the question of workers in disabilities , that it progress on the issue of gender equality , that it progress on non-discrimination , that it also progress in terms of ethics and transparency with regard to appointments with , in particular , the representatives of interests . Lastly , I do not know how to tell you this , but Parliament might deserve to be listened to a little more with regard to appointments , over which the Council ultimately has the power , which we do not dispute , but perhaps perhaps he could at least have the politeness and kindness to explain himself when he overrides a vote in Parliament – ​​and we saw this very recently with the representative of the Polish State for the Court of Auditors . We are in a situation that makes us doubt the will of the Council to find consensual solutions , solutions that respect the positions of each other . Let us not put ourselves in opposition , it is not the European logic , it is not what we want , it is not what you want .

      "Ramona Strugariu , rapporteur . – Madam President , let me start by saying a big thank you to all of my colleagues for this excellent report and for our work together and also to the institutions that I have been in charge with for the good collaboration . I wish that we could collaborate in such a way everywhere because it is such an important exercise . Now a few words on each of these institutions or categories of institutions . On the Court of Justice , as a rapporteur of the European Parliament I would simply like to congratulate the Court on the functioning of their institution in 2019 . Through its reference to the adaptability to new technologies , through the commitment to financial efficiency , to environment and most importantly to delivering high quality and timely judgments , the Court is one of the example institutions of the Union . I would like to draw attention , however , to the fact that for good functioning of an institution , not only its financial but also its human resources need to be adjusted , keeping in mind the principle of maintaining high quality deliverables . And increasing the number of judges must be supplemented with an adequate increase in supporting staff allowing for an equitable division of labour and avoiding situations of burnout . I appreciate the efforts of the Court to increase efficiency and to ensure the mental health support of its employees , but outside support here is vital as well . Transparency is an area where the Court has good results , but where there is still room for improvement , and it is my hope that in the future , CVs and declarations of interest of Members will be available on the Court ’ s website . Moving to the Justice and Home Affairs agencies , in most of the cases I must say that I ’ m happy about the situation in 2019 . As a message , we encourage EU agencies to work together to identify common aims – to cooperate in order to facilitate economies of scale , joint public procurement schemes , common strategies for cybersecurity , ecological transition or improving the ethical standards , are examples of areas where agencies are encouraged to cooperate . In the fields of ethics and transparency it is important that all agencies use declarations of interest , and this is a topic that I will come back to every single time until it is happening , because I consider it a key issue . It is not for an employee or a member of the management to make self-assessments of interest , and in terms of ethics and transparency this kind of assessment must be done by a third party , such as an independent EU ethics body . A remark on the European Asylum Support Office ( EASO ) . After a few years of postponing the discharge for 2019 we do acknowledge the positive changes and the commitment of the new executive director for the sound management of the office . It also has been through a transformation process , a very good one . It has improved governance and internal control systems . A few words on Frontex where we have decided to postpone the discharge in the committee . It is one of the most important decentralised agencies . Its scale , the mandate and the budget have all been upgraded by the new regulation in 2019 in order to respond to the necessity of having a strong and effective institution for managing the EU ’ s external borders .

    "raw1_4 = 'Ramona Strugariu, rapporteur. – Madam President, let me start by saying a big thank you to all of my colleagues for this excellent report and for our work together and also to the institutions that I have been in charge with for the good collaboration. I wish that we could collaborate in such a way everywhere because it is such an important exercise. Now a few words on each of these institutions or categories of institutions. On the Court of Justice, as a rapporteur of the European Parliament I would simply like to congratulate the Court on the functioning of their institution in 2019. Through its reference to the adaptability to new technologies, through the commitment to financial efficiency, to environment and most importantly to delivering high quality and timely judgments, the Court is one of the example institutions of the Union. I would like to draw attention, however, to the fact that for good functioning of an institution, not only its financial but also its human resources need to be adjusted, keeping in mind the principle of maintaining high quality deliverables. And increasing the number of judges must be supplemented with an adequate increase in supporting staff allowing for an equitable division of labour and avoiding situations of burnout. I appreciate the efforts of the Court to increase efficiency and to ensure the mental health support of its employees, but outside support here is vital as well. Transparency is an area where the Court has good results, but where there is still room for improvement, and it is my hope that in the future, CVs and declarations of interest of Members will be available on the Court’s website. Moving to the Justice and Home Affairs agencies, in most of the cases I must say that I’m happy about the situation in 2019. As a message, we encourage EU agencies to work together to identify common aims – to cooperate in order to facilitate economies of scale, joint public procurement schemes, common strategies for cybersecurity, ecological transition or improving the ethical standards, are examples of areas where agencies are encouraged to cooperate. In the fields of ethics and transparency it is important that all agencies use declarations of interest, and this is a topic that I will come back to every single time until it is happening, because I consider it a key issue. It is not for an employee or a member of the management to make self-assessments of interest, and in terms of ethics and transparency this kind of assessment must be done by a third party, such as an independent EU ethics body. A remark on the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). After a few years of postponing the discharge for 2019 we do acknowledge the positive changes and the commitment of the new executive director for the sound management of the office. It also has been through a transformation process, a very good one. It has improved governance and internal control systems. A few words on Frontex where we have decided to postpone the discharge in the committee. It is one of the most important decentralised agencies. Its scale, the mandate and the budget have all been upgraded by the new regulation in 2019 in order to respond to the necessity of having a strong and effective institution for managing the EU’s external borders. Implementing the new mandate is of course a challenge but this agency is a key component of the EU’s security and, with greater power, comes greater responsibility. The regulation actually takes note of that. The management team of the agency must fully implement the provisions of this regulation without any hesitation. Here, however, through the hearings that we organise, exchanges of views, journalistic investigations – and there were many – after listening to the representatives of the agency, to the representatives of the Commission, it seems quite clear that there has been, first of all, a reluctance in fully implementing this mandate of the new regulation. There has been some proper management issues, and these are quite strong reasons, I would say, to postpone the discharge for 2019. I truly hope that the assistance of the Frontex Scrutiny Working Group that we constituted will help, that the management board and those responsible for the good governance of the agency will be able to correct the issues identified which led to the postponement of this year’s discharge. We all aim for a strong and trustworthy Frontex and when there are problems I think that it is vital that we tackle these problems from the beginning as soon as they are signalled, fully addressing the issues that we identified, so that we do not repeat unsuccessful stories of a postponement for years and years that could affect deeply the mandate of the agency.

      "Olivier Chastel , rapporteur . – Madam President , Commissioner , President of the Court of Auditors , ladies and gentlemen , this week we are closing the discharge process for 2019 . We started this process last September and I would really like to thank the vast majority of European bodies for their collaboration and work – the Commission , Parliament , agencies , development funds , joint undertakings and other institutions . As you will have noticed since the beginning of this session , my Renew Europe group was precisely rapporteur for the other institutions and I specifically dealt with the European Ombudsman and the European Economic and Social Committee . We did not grant discharge last year to the Economic and Social Committee because of serious malfunctions that had occurred there . Given the improvements put in place in the fight against harassment , the new code of conduct , the solutions provided for victims of harassment , we have decided , for 2019 , to grant him discharge . But the message is clear : the Committee on Budgetary Control supports the new Chair of the Committee , Christa Schweng , in her actions , her renovation process , but we will be vigilant as to how the situation develops . As regards the services of the European Ombudsman , I would like to renew to this body and to its director , Emily OReilly , our congratulations for the work accomplished . I hope that in the coming months , the Ombudsman will be able to claim greater media visibility , because it is an essential link for advancing transparency and ethics , and therefore for maintaining the trust of citizens in European institutions . My thanks , of course , to the Court of Auditors , for its work , its independence and its rigor . We have a powerful tool there and I can only advise the members of our assembly to regularly consult the work and special reports of the Court of Auditors . I say it often : the Court of Auditors is the best ally of European citizens and therefore of the European Parliament . Dear colleagues , the discharge process is neither a trivial gesture nor a formality . It is a major political act which makes it possible to endorse the management of funds , transparency , but also to sanction abuses , ineffective policies and the misuse of public money . This good management is essential to maintain the credibility and legitimacy of our political project with European taxpayers . This year , out of the 52 European bodies examined , we are not granting discharge to the Council or to the European Council – we have just spoken about this and this has moreover been the case since 2009 – , nor to the Frontex agency , and we have just developed the reasons that led us to make this decision . As regards Frontex , we are postponing the discharge ; it is an appointment clause that we give to the agency in six months . Let things be clear : this is not a questioning of the missions of the agency , and even less of its existence . In general , in the 2019 procedure , our Renew Europe political group remained vigilant on the regularity of the accounts and on the performance of the policies carried out . This year , for the first time , we have benefited from a report dedicated to performance , which has been one of our long-standing requests . It is one thing to have accounts without errors , without irregularities , but the money must be effectively invested in economically promising projects , policies with significant leverage effects on growth and employment . Every euro spent must be spent efficiently . Our vigilance will have to be further increased in the coming years , given the implementation of the new multiannual budgetary programming and of Next Generation EU , endowed with 750 billion , and given the numerous expenses incurred in the context of the COVID-19 crisis . . In this respect , I am pleased that in recent years OLAF has been strengthened and the European Public Prosecutors Office created . This is a first step , but we still need to make progress in tracking down fraud and mismanagement . Furthermore , I remain concerned about the very low absorption capacity of the Member States . Only 9 States out of 27 have a better absorption capacity compared to 2012 , the European average being barely 40 % . How do we lift our economy with such low numbers ? Moreover , what is the point of freeing up such significant resources , if the States are not in a position to use this money ?

Data mining , with programs such as Arachne or CEEDS , better transparency of funds , digitization of procedures , simplification of administrative rules , better training and technical assistance for administrations , but also for applicants , especially the smallest SMEs .

For example , the boards of some agencies are too numerous , risking ineffective decision-making and significantly increasing administrative costs . The international reach of the agency is often limited . Most agencies would need to improve accountability and performance and improve reporting due to the qualified opinion on the legality and regularity of payments underlying the accounts by the European Court of Auditors . I will now present the arrangements for two agencies : the European Asylum Support Office and the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators . Starting with EASO : the Court of Auditors concluded that it had reasonable assurance that its annual accounts are reliable and that it had sufficient audit evidence about the legality and regularity of the revenue underlying the accounts . However , we issued qualified opinions on our findings for the 2016 , 2017 and 2018 financial years on the legality of the regularity of payments . For 2019 , the Court found other payment-related errors , except for the effects of the 2016 , 2017 and 2018 errors and the 2019 observation payments . The payments underlying the annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2019 are legal and correct in all other and essential respects . It should be noted that the new executive director was appointed on June 16 , 2019 . Regarding an investigation by the European Anti-Fraud Office , following the report at the end of 2018 by OLAF , it opened three disciplinary proceedings that are currently pending . The procurement procedures by the office for temporary staff in Greece and premises rented by the office in Lesvos were not correct . The tendering procedures of the Office for temporary agency workers in Italy were irregular , although payments for these contracts had not yet been made . The procedures of the Office for selecting and contracting external experts systematically lacked a solid audit trail , which in turn resulted in a lack of evidence that the Office treated experts equally in its selection procedures . I will now move on to the second agency - ACER . Let us start with budget and financial management . The budget implementation rate was 99.50 % , which was above the planned 95 % target of the agency . This represents an increase of 0.25 % compared to 2018 , in addition , the implementation rate for payment appropriations was 81.35 % , an increase of 1.62 % compared to 2018 . However , the opinion of the Court was to the legality and regularity of the payments underlying the accounts for which the total amount incorrectly paid corresponds to EUR 988 138 , representing 6.3 % of all payments made by the Agency in 2019 . Incorrect payments found related to two irregular procurement procedures which were not carried out in accordance with the competition procedures . In addition , recruitment procedures were not properly applied in the selection process , resulting in the agency not respecting the principle of equal treatment and not applying effective internal controls . However , the agency reported that its internal control framework was effective , the annual assessment of its implementation revealed no shortcomings and the strategic audit plan of the agency for 2017-2019 was fully implemented . The agency is also taking further steps to increase the transparency of its activities , such as reporting on meetings of agency staff with external parties ( in particular meetings of the agency director with organizations and self-employed persons ) and publishing them on the website of the agency . At the same time , we should insist that the agency reports to the discharge authority without delay on the development of its current IT governance and market surveillance activities Remi ( i.e . the European Parliament and Council Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency ) .

      "Ryszard Czarnecki , Rapporteur . - Madam President ! Mr. President of the Tribunal ! I am rapporteur on the agencies together with my previous speaker , Mr Brudziński , as well as on joint ventures and the European Development Fund . I will start with the agency . The Court issued an unqualified audit opinion on the reliability of the accounts of all agencies . We also delivered an unqualified opinion on the legality and regularity of the revenues underlying all agencies and an unqualified opinion on the legality and regularity of payments underlying the accounts of the agencies , with the exception of ACER , the European Union Agency for Energy Regulators and the European Support Office . Asylum Area - EASO . In terms of results , the European Union Agencies Network has created a Shared Services Task Force and a Shared Opportunity 2.0 Strategic Proposition to encourage and support inter-agency cooperation . In relation to procurement , the Court made over 80 observations highlighting areas for improvement in 29 agencies . Most of the comments concern weaknesses in public procurement procedures , as was the case a year ago . These weaknesses mainly relate to sound financial management and regularity . At the end of 2018 , most agencies reported that they had implemented the revised internal control framework and carried out an annual evaluation . However , we call for the adoption and implementation of boards of internal control by all agencies , not the majority , to bring their internal control into line with international best practice and to ensure that internal control effectively supports the decision-making process . Let us now focus on the issues related to Frontex , i.e . that EU agency , which is based in Poland , in Warsaw , from which I have the honor to speak . I would like to start by pointing out that the agency is leading the initiative to create a common liaison offices in Brussels for agencies operating in the field of justice and home affairs in order to efficiently use resources and share facilities and services and to foster networking . In addition , the agency , through its inspection and control office , participates in the EU Agents Network Performance Development Network . The agency also participates in the public procurement officer network , assessing interinstitutional tenders against needs and financial resources . Next , I would like to highlight the already completed , currently implemented activities of the agency , aimed at ensuring transparency , preventing and managing conflicts of interest and protecting whistleblowers . This whistleblowing policy was adopted , I recall , two years ago , in July 2019 . However , it is necessary to point out some shortcomings in the employment policy of the agency . We expect improvement here . I propose to grant discharge to all agencies . Now for the joint ventures : all the financial statements for the joint ventures have been approved by the Court of Auditors - the President can confirm this - which means that the accounts show the financial position reliably and , in line with the accounting principles , the transactions in the payment of income are free from material error . However , many areas require improvement . For example , while the internal control mechanisms for payments were overall effective in keeping the error rate below 2 % , there were persistent weaknesses in procurement , grant payments and staff selection procedures for several joint ventures . On the other hand , some Joint Undertakings carrying out activities under Horizon 2020 have not achieved the expected progress , despite the fact that their planned duration is in most cases 10 years after 2024 . So far , on average , i.e . three years before the end of this program , only 51 % of activities have been implemented - this is more than half of the activities planned under the program we are talking about . However , it should also be noted that at the end of the year we are talking about , the Joint Undertakings belonging to the action have completed most of the procedures for calls for proposals and on average have already procured or contracted 78 % of the planned activities . Finally , when it comes to the F4T joint ventures , i.e . ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy , for another year in a row , I note that a fusion energy project co-financed by the European Union implemented in France is threatened with further cost increases and delays in implementation compared to the currently adopted assumptions . In addition , weaknesses in public procurement and in the management of human resources and projects by joint ventures carry the risk of far-reaching operational ineffectiveness . Last but not least , with regard to the European Development Fund , I am concerned about the opinion of the Court available on the legality of the regularity of expenditure , but I am pleased with the results that have been achieved with the related public policy in order to promote joint growth and aid , especially in social and geographical situations , and - to really end now - on the results that the Union has achieved through its contribution to the 13th objective of increased development and control of corruption , and the results achieved through the mobilization of evidence ...

    "raw1_8 = 'Ryszard Czarnecki, Rapporteur. - Madam President! Mr. President of the Tribunal! I am rapporteur on the agencies together with my previous speaker, Mr Brudziński, as well as on joint ventures and the European Development Fund. I will start with the agency. The Court issued an unqualified audit opinion on the reliability of the accounts of all agencies. We also delivered an unqualified opinion on the legality and regularity of the revenues underlying all agencies and an unqualified opinion on the legality and regularity of payments underlying the accounts of the agencies, with the exception of ACER, the European Union Agency for Energy Regulators and the European Support Office. Asylum Area - EASO. In terms of results, the European Union Agencies Network has created a Shared Services Task Force and a Shared Opportunity 2.0 Strategic Proposition to encourage and support inter-agency cooperation. In relation to procurement, the Court made over 80 observations highlighting areas for improvement in 29 agencies. Most of the comments concern weaknesses in public procurement procedures, as was the case a year ago. These weaknesses mainly relate to sound financial management and regularity. At the end of 2018, most agencies reported that they had implemented the revised internal control framework and carried out an annual evaluation. However, we call for the adoption and implementation of boards of internal control by all agencies, not the majority, to bring their internal control into line with international best practice and to ensure that internal control effectively supports the decision-making process. Let us now focus on the issues related to Frontex, i.e. that EU agency, which is based in Poland, in Warsaw, from which I have the honor to speak. I would like to start by pointing out that the agency is leading the initiative to create a common liaison offices in Brussels for agencies operating in the field of justice and home affairs in order to efficiently use resources and share facilities and services and to foster networking. In addition, the agency, through its inspection and control office, participates in the EU Agents Network Performance Development Network. The agency also participates in the public procurement officer network, assessing interinstitutional tenders against needs and financial resources. Next, I would like to highlight the already completed, currently implemented activities of the agency, aimed at ensuring transparency, preventing and managing conflicts of interest and protecting whistleblowers. This whistleblowing policy was adopted, I recall, two years ago, in July 2019. However, it is necessary to point out some shortcomings in the employment policy of the agency. We expect improvement here. I propose to grant discharge to all agencies. Now for the joint ventures: all the financial statements for the joint ventures have been approved by the Court of Auditors - the President can confirm this - which means that the accounts show the financial position reliably and, in line with the accounting principles, the transactions in the payment of income are free from material error . However, many areas require improvement. For example, while the internal control mechanisms for payments were overall effective in keeping the error rate below 2%, there were persistent weaknesses in procurement, grant payments and staff selection procedures for several joint ventures. On the other hand, some Joint Undertakings carrying out activities under Horizon 2020 have not achieved the expected progress, despite the fact that their planned duration is in most cases 10 years after 2024. So far, on average, i.e. three years before the end of this program, only 51% of activities have been implemented - this is more than half of the activities planned under the program we are talking about. However, it should also be noted that at the end of the year we are talking about, the Joint Undertakings belonging to the action have completed most of the procedures for calls for proposals and on average have already procured or contracted 78% of the planned activities. Finally, when it comes to the F4T joint ventures, i.e. ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy, for another year in a row, I note that a fusion energy project co-financed by the European Union implemented in France is threatened with further cost increases and delays in implementation compared to the currently adopted assumptions. In addition, weaknesses in public procurement and in the management of human resources and projects by joint ventures carry the risk of far-reaching operational ineffectiveness. Last but not least, with regard to the European Development Fund, I am concerned about the opinion of the Court available on the legality of the regularity of expenditure, but I am pleased with the results that have been achieved with the related public policy in order to promote joint growth and aid, especially in social and geographical situations, and - to really end now - on the results that the Union has achieved through its contribution to the 13th objective of increased development and control of corruption, and the results achieved through the mobilization of evidence ...'\n",

I would also like to extend my thanks to the Commission and to the Court of Auditors and all those who contribute to the good management of EU funds .

      "Klaus-Heiner Lehne , President of the European Court of Auditors . – Madam President , ladies and gentlemen rapporteurs , distinguished Members of the European Parliament , dear Madam President of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen ! First of all , I would like to thank you very much for the opportunity to speak here today - and also in the presence of the rapporteur for the annual report of the European Court of Auditors , Tony Murphy - in this discharge debate . I think it is also a recognition of the work of the Court of Auditors that such a big debate can take place here in such difficult times . The annual report of the European Court of Auditors served as the basis for your detailed work and I am pleased that my colleagues and I have been able to accompany and support Parliament , as we do every year , in the fulfillment of this extremely important political task conferred on it by the Treaties . As set out in our strategy for the coming years , ensuring sound assurance in a difficult and changing environment remains a key priority for the Court . The budgetary context of your decision could not be more sensitive . The ratification of the new own resources decision in the Member States is not yet complete , but fortunately many hurdles have already been overcome . Public debt has increased significantly in the current pandemic and citizens expect the EU budget and the new funds that the Commission will raise from the markets to be used wisely and correctly . We should use the situation created by the current pandemic to improve our systems , to promote digitization in all Member States when managing EU funds , to use EU funds more effectively and efficiently and to do more to fight fraud , corruption and conflicts of interest to do . Ladies and gentlemen ! By now you are well acquainted with the content of our annual report and I welcome the fact that our findings are reflected in the resolutions of the Parliament . I also congratulate Parliament on seamlessly integrating performance issues affecting different policy areas of the European Union into its resolution . As a decision-maker , you must adapt to the future Multiannual Financial Framework while continuing to draw lessons from the previous one - the payments of which , as you know , will continue for several years to come . I also take note of the many specific requests directly related to the methodology and work of the Court , some of which – and this is not surprising – I am not hearing for the first time : requests for geographically specific information , for transaction audits , to specific error rates , to corrective measures or even to an accelerated schedule . I can assure you , in line with our strategy , we seek to complement the quantitative information in our annual report with qualitative elements based on the results of specific systems and compliance audit work . In this context , we will also take into account the corrective capacity of the bodies we audit . We will endeavor to use the resources dedicated to our assurance work as efficiently as possible . Of course , this also includes the increased use of data and IT tools and technologies , for which we already see potential in the short term as part of our audits of the reliability of the accounts and our audits of the regularity of revenue and administrative expenditure and will also implement this . As part of our audit approach , we will continue to take into account that there are still significant differences in the level of risk across the different policy areas of the European Union . To this end , we will assess these risks and all other available information in planning and performing our substantive work procedures . In the 2021-2025 period , we will make maximum use of the work done by auditees and other auditors , where reliable , to use our resources more efficiently and reduce administrative burdens , including for beneficiaries . Furthermore , some of the new audit ideas that this Parliament has in mind would require a lot of additional work and therefore additional resources that we would have to invest in our Statement of Assurance . The Court is constantly striving to increase the efficiency of its working methods , both with regard to the preparation of the Statement of Assurance and , of course , within the framework of the performance audits . However , efficiency gains alone will not cope with the increased workload due to Next Generation EU and SURE , nor will your concerns be met . I am therefore pleased to note the Parliamentary request for more staff to be made available to the Court - a request that we also made in our draft estimates for 2022 . But I also take this opportunity to address the Commission , as the body responsible for consolidating and bringing together the budget estimates of the other institutions : like the Commissioner , we are of course aware that resources are scarce and that budgetary rigor must be applied . As a body , we have consistently demonstrated this rigor over the past few years . However , in the context of the efforts by the Court to ensure adequate staffing for the Next Generation EU audit and other pressing challenges , we are determined to convincingly present our position on this to the budgetary authority - the Parliament and the Council . It is already a consequence of common sense that if the budget almost doubles over a period of a few years , the same examination density can not be achieved with the same resources . I think we owe it to the European taxpayer and citizen as a whole that adequate control is carried out - including by the external auditor . Regarding the audit of the European Investment Bank by the Court , your draft resolution is particularly noteworthy in its call for increased auditing and accountability - things we have always supported . To conclude , I would therefore like to briefly inform you about the current status of the most recent three-way talks that we held to review our examination regulations in the so-called Tripartite Agreement . The technical discussions are progressing well and I am cautiously optimistic that we will reach agreement before the summer on the problems we have been facing continuously in our exams . At this point I would also like to thank President Hoyer for his constructive attitude in this regard . "

Of course , there is still room for improvement . On the positive side , it seems to me that agencies are trying to reduce costs by joining a group and a network of agencies . This also avoids overlapping similar tasks . I expect the agencies to respond to warnings and optimize their operations , which of course also applies to the European Commission .

I have no major comments on financial operations and, in the view of the Court of Auditors, the transactions are legal and the financial situation of the agencies is fairly presented. Of course, there is still room for improvement. On the positive side, it seems to me that agencies are trying to reduce costs by joining a group and a network of agencies. This also avoids overlapping similar tasks. I expect the agencies to respond to warnings and optimize their operations, which of course also applies to the European Commission. The European institutions must do their job professionally - first and foremost - and efficiently, but spend resources rationally and transparently, because it is the money of all Europeans.'\n",

      "Daniel Freund ( Verts/ALE ) . – Madam President , dear colleagues ! We all get the so-called office fee every month , 4563 EUR . EUR 273,780 in the course of one legislature – tax-free . With this money we can rent constituency offices , computers , telephones , organize events , and if you use the money properly , I think you can do a lot of good work for the European Union . As with all public funds , we should handle this money very well and responsibly . And that is why I take two things for granted here : we should keep accounts for every euro that we spend , and we should give back to the European taxpayer every euro that we do not spend .

First of all , I would like to thank you for the great support and the positive words that were spoken today in the debate on the Court of Auditors . I can promise that I will take it with me to Luxembourg and pass it on to my colleagues accordingly . Ms. Hohlmeier addressed a very crucial point – in her last contribution , when it came to the question of how we can become more effective and how we can become better . She pointed out that there are up to 300 different systems in the Member States - I can only confirm that . Of course , we always have the problem with our exams that you are confronted with completely different systems and these different systems are of course not compatible with a possible digital exam . I might ask this House , the legislator , the Commission , but also the Council , to think about the possibility – and think about it very seriously – whether changing the Financial Regulation with a long-term perspective , so to speak , can at least ensure that everyone those who deal with European money in Europe deliver compatible data that can then be used afterwards in a simple , digitized process . We are discussing digitization everywhere - even in the courtyard . We then notice again and again that we encounter considerable resistance and problems right from the start - simply due to the different facts , due to the different systems - and at some point this has to be fundamentally changed . I do not believe in harmonizing all of that , but that it has to be at least compatible - I think that is imperative , and that is something that you can also prescribe . One more sentence , perhaps , on the situation of our resources , because today , in the discharge declaration as well as in the Conference of Committee Chairs , we are of course hearing a large number of requests - in the Council as well - what we should still do - with pleasure , at any time ! But then we also need the necessary resources . The European Parliament , the Conference of Committee Chairs , sent us more than 100 proposals for special reports – and we are pleased about that , it shows interest in our work . In the end we do 25 , 30 , 35 , in particularly good years maybe up to 50 ; that is about half of our resources that we use for it . In other words , the need in this area is obviously very , very great . It is always a complex process of deliberation for us to decide what to do and what not to do ; and we have exactly the same problem in the area of ​​compliance - above all with the annual report , where again and again , every year , the Council and here in the plenary session call for the following : There is still the error rate for this area , which makes it even more intensive – comparable every year . Sorry ! All of this has its feasible limits and we have to make decisions every time with the limited resources that we have , what works and what does not work , and in the end it is always something where compromises have to be found . I simply ask for your understanding that this is the case and that it will probably remain so in the future . We will not be able to fulfill all wishes and demands - that is simply a fact . Good , and I believe that I have already exceeded my speaking time . Thank you again for your attention . "

But I believe that we are all equally challenged - also against the background of the limited funds that are ultimately available to us - to identify potential where we can make further savings on the one hand , reallocations that ultimately enable us to actually do our job .
