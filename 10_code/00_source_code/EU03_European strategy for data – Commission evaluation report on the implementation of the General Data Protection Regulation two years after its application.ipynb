We discussed the European strategy for data together and , as you know , the Commission is committed , both at the legislative level and through the program and the industrial alliance , so that Europe can benefit fully from the wave of industrial data that will define our ability to integrate the digital transformation of our industrial ecosystems . The Commission is counting on the support of your Parliament , particularly in the various legislative files already on the table , but also in those to come . Turning to the GDPR , I would like to thank you again for our interesting discussion . I am pleased to see that we share many ideas on how to continue the work for an effective implementation and enforcement of the GDPR . On SMEs , the Commission is ready to assist the development of consistent and practical national guidance and guidelines of the EDPB in order to help businesses , in particular SMEs , to comply with data provision rules . The Commission financially supports national data protection authorities in their efforts to reach out to SMEs and citizens . And we will continue this financial support in 2021 , including on projects aimed at developing templates and all the practical tools to help SMEs to comply with the rules . As announced in the Commission evaluation report , we will also explore whether , in the light of further experience and relevant case-law , proposing possible targeted amendments to certain provisions of the GDPR might be appropriate in the future , in particular regarding records of processing by SMEs that do not have the processing of personal data as their core business . While it is clear that there is still work ahead to improve the effectiveness of the implementation of the GDPR , I am convinced that our efforts will contribute to reaching our ambition of creating a common culture of data protection in the EU , and even beyond . I look forward to continuing of course our exchange on the GDPR and on data protection issues more generally . So thank you very much also again for your support . "

    "raw1_10 = 'Didier Reynders, Member of the Commission. – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, once again I would like to thank Parliament for its support in this ambitious data agenda. We discussed the European strategy for data together and, as you know, the Commission is committed, both at the legislative level and through the program and the industrial alliance, so that Europe can benefit fully from the wave of industrial data that will define our ability to integrate the digital transformation of our industrial ecosystems. The Commission is counting on the support of your Parliament, particularly in the various legislative files already on the table, but also in those to come. Turning to the GDPR, I would like to thank you again for our interesting discussion. I am pleased to see that we share many ideas on how to continue the work for an effective implementation and enforcement of the GDPR. On SMEs, the Commission is ready to assist the development of consistent and practical national guidance and guidelines of the EDPB in order to help businesses, in particular SMEs, to comply with data provision rules. The Commission financially supports national data protection authorities in their efforts to reach out to SMEs and citizens. And we will continue this financial support in 2021, including on projects aimed at developing templates and all the practical tools to help SMEs to comply with the rules. As announced in the Commission evaluation report, we will also explore whether, in the light of further experience and relevant case-law, proposing possible targeted amendments to certain provisions of the GDPR might be appropriate in the future, in particular regarding records of processing by SMEs that do not have the processing of personal data as their core business. While it is clear that there is still work ahead to improve the effectiveness of the implementation of the GDPR, I am convinced that our efforts will contribute to reaching our ambition of creating a common culture of data protection in the EU, and even beyond. I look forward to continuing of course our exchange on the GDPR and on data protection issues more generally. So thank you very much also again for your support.'\n",
