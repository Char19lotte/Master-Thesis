    "raw000 = 'Nancy PELOSI . Madam Speaker , I rise to support this bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act : which honors our values , supports our servicemembers and families , strengthens our security and advances our leadership in the world . Thank you to Chairman Smith , the Committee and staff for their patriotic , persistent leadership on this legislation , which reflects the brilliance and diversity of the whole House . This bill honors our responsibility to meet the needs of the servicemembers who sacrifice for our freedoms , and their families . It does so by : Providing a pay raise for our men and women in uniform , Strengthening parental leave for caregivers , Expanding access to child care , Improving the financial security of military members , including those who are low-income and have family members living with disabilities , Protecting military communities from PFAS `` forever chemicals . '' This NDAA also makes historic changes to better combat sexual assault in the military , including creating an Office of Special Victim Prosecutor within each service to prosecute crimes and criminalizing sexual harassment under the UCMJ ( Uniform Code of Military Justice ) . And it improves military health care , including related to mental health ,the reproductive healthof women and suicide prevention . In terms of protecting our security , there are many provisions of which to be proud in this NDAA . This legislation helps America combat our adversaries and invest in our alliances -- with strong action to deter China and Russia , fight transnational threats and counter violent extremism . And it brings our defense further into the 21st Century -- with an historic 36 percent increase in defense-wide research & development , $ 2.5 billion to fix aging infrastructure & support security-related R & D , $ 1 billion in new cybersecurity investments , over $ 1 billion for artificial intelligence efforts and investments in new partnerships with the private sector and academia , including HBCUs and Minority- Serving Institutions . This NDAA builds on the bipartisan action of Congress in passing Special Immigrant Visa ( SIV ) legislation to provide for the relocation of our Afghan allies and partners , as it authorizes $ 500 million for this effort . This bipartisan policy bill has been signed into law for 60 consecutive years . We all look forward to seeing the Congress continue this proud tradition , as we pass this NDAA on a bipartisan basis and send it to the  desk of the President for his signature . Doing so allows us to honor the vision of our Founders , as set out in the Preamble , to `` provide for the common defense , '' and `` secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity . '\n",
    "raw001 = 'Jerry McNERNEY . Mr. Speaker , I thank the chairman for yielding and for recognizing this legislation . Mr. Speaker , I rise today in support of my legislation , H.R . 3723 , the Consumer Safety Technology Act . H.R . 3723 will encourage the use of emerging technologies , specifically artificial intelligence and blockchains , to help keep consumers safe . It will aid our consumer protection agencies with carrying out their missions . H.R . 3723 incorporates the AI for Consumer Product Safety Act legislation that I authored with Representative Burgess . These provisions direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission , CPSC , to establish a pilot program for the agency to use AI in furtherance of the work of the agency to protect consumers from unsafe products . For example , the CPSC could use artificial intelligence to more quickly and efficiently identify consumer product hazards , such as exploding laptops that have faulty batteries , defective USB chargers , furniture that tips over , and unsafe infant sleeping products . Being able to identify these hazards more quickly will enable the CPSC to [ [ Page H2946 ] ] help also recall products more quickly and , in turn , help save lives . We have heard firsthand from CPSC commissioners when they testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee that artificial intelligence can benefit the work of the agency in serving the American people . I am pleased that last year my legislation , the AI in Government Act , was enacted into law . Among other things , the AI in Government Act establishes an AI Center of Excellence to facilitate adoption of AI technology in the Federal Government . This will provide a central resource within the government to aid agencies with AI adoption and help agencies share best practices . But it is also critical that agencies build up their capacity internally to adopt AI technology . H.R . 3723 will empower the CPSC to do just that . The experience of the CPSC here will also serve as an example for other agencies that are looking to integrate AI in furtherance of the missions of their agencies . H.R . 3723 also incorporates the Blockchain Innovation Act introduced by Representative Soto and Guthrie . These provisions will help ensure that we use the benefits of blockchain technology to help stop scams and fraud . Additionally , H.R . 3723 incorporates the Digital Taxonomy Act from Representatives Soto and Davidson . These provisions will help ensure the scammers and fraudsters do not get ahead of consumers and law enforcement in the realm of blockchain and digital tokens . Mr. Speaker , I thank Representatives Burgess , Soto , Guthrie , and Davidson for their work in H.R . 3723 , and Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member Rodgers for helping to move this important bill . Mr. Speaker , I urge all of my colleagues to support it .'\n",
    "raw002 = 'Michael BURGESS . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of the legislation with Representative McNerney , H.R . 3723 , the Consumer Safety Technology Act . You know , over my time in the Energy and Commerce Committee , I have made several trips out to the CPSC and observed firsthand how the men and women dedicate their lives to ensuring that consumers have safe products , that consumers have products that are not going to cause harm to the user . And as we approach the anniversary of our the independence of our Nation on July 4 , I also have a lot of respect for these same individuals who ensure that our fireworks that are sold at the commercial stands at the side of the road also meet certain specifications . So as we approach Independence Day , it is always a good time to acknowledge the work done by the men and women in the Consumer Product Safety Commission . The bill we are talking about today actually passed the last Congress by a voice vote , but it did fail to advance in the United States Senate . It includes the bill that Mr. McNerney and I introduced , the Artificial Intelligence for Consumer Product Safety legislation , along with , as referenced , the Blockchain Innovation Act and the Digital Taxonomy Act . We are once again considering this bill because this is commonsense legislation that should be signed into law to improve and modernize our consumer protection agencies . The Consumer Product Safety Commission has jurisdiction over 15,000 consumer products . Many of these are purchased online without the consumer reviewing or assessing the product in person . Throughout the time of the pandemic , Americans have sought to fulfill their needs through online shopping , and many companies and small businesses have innovated products to further increase convenience of daily life . The pool of products available to consumers is continually expanding , putting further strain on the Consumer Product Safety Commission to ensure the safety of those products . While technological advances are increasing the number of types of products available for consumption , the Consumer Product Safety Commission can employ advanced technology to assist in that mission . This bill directs the Consumer Safety Product Commission to establish a pilot program to use artificial intelligence for tracking injury trends , identifying consumer product hazards , monitoring the retail marketplace for the sale of recalled products , or identifying unsafe imported consumer products . It is safe to say that when the Consumer Product Safety Commission was created , no one anticipated the sheer volume of material that would be being imported , for which they now have responsibility . Artifical intelligence uses algorithms to quickly automate human functions and to filter and analyze data . Artificial intelligence is already advancing capabilities in multiple sectors to better serve consumers by increasing capacity and enhancing outcomes . As artificial intelligence advances , it should be capable of helping predict fail rates and identifying problems in consumer products before they can significantly impact the market . If we want the United States to stay ahead of China and other global competitors , we must advance and utilize artificial intelligence in all appropriate products and processes . I can think of no better place to implement these capabilities than in the protection of products used every single day by American consumers . Mr. Speaker , I urge colleagues to support this bill . Again , it passed the last Congress in a voice vote . We should advance it today .'\n",
    "raw003 = 'Darren SOTO . Mr. Speaker , I thank Chairman Pallone , Chairwoman Schakowsky , Representative McNerney , Ranking Member Rodgers , Ranking Member Bilirakis , and Representative Guthrie for bringing forward these key bills on technology . Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence , blockchain technologies , and cryptocurrency are playing a growing importance in our daily lives and are going to be an economic driver for the 21st century economy . Blockchain , in essence , is a fixed ledger . Once you add data or a transaction , it can not be changed . Therefore , it makes the data have integrity and makes sure that , as we are doing transactions and adding data over the internet , it cannot be changed and that there is certainty to it . That is why it is so critical . Then once we add AI to analyze this fixed data , we could help solve some of the largest problems that we face as a nation : healthcare , climate change , to be two examples ; the delivery of personal protection equipment during a pandemic . And , of course , cryptocurrency allows for small businesses , in particular , to provide services across the world without the transaction costs of exchanging currencies . It will help with remittances and other ways that we can modernize our economy . It is essential that the United States continue to be a global leader in these emerging technologies to ensure our democratic values remain at the forefront of this technological development . Authoritarian regimes like China and Russia are investing heavily in these areas . It is absolutely critical for the free world to invest and to win the future in these areas . Also , as a responsible global leader , the United States must strike the appropriate balance of providing an environment that fosters innovation while ensuring appropriate consumer protection . That is why I am proud to work with Representative McNerney on H.R . 3723 . It includes parts of the Digital Taxonomy Act and all of the Blockchain Innovation Act . As many of you know , blockchain technology will be helpful in the ways we discussed already . First , H.R . 3639 , the Blockchain Innovation Act , directs the Department of Commerce , in consultation with the FCC , to conduct a study and submit to Congress a report on the state of blockchain technology in commerce , including its use to reduce fraud and increase security . Mr. Speaker , I thank Representative Guthrie for cosponsoring and co- introducing this bill . This is a first step toward a long-term goal of setting up a Blockchain Center of Excellence in the Department of Commerce . In addition , the Digital Taxonomy Act requires a similar report from the FCC to report recommendations on deceptive practices , and the relationship between the FTC , FCC , and the CFTC . [ [ Page H2947 ] ] Mr. Speaker , I thank Representative Davidson for his cosponsorship . When we look at market volatility , the use of cryptocurrency for ransomware in recent attacks like the Colonial Pipeline and tax evasion , it is critical that we get in on the front end of this . Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to work with Representative McNerney , and I urge support for H.R . 3723 . '\n",
    "raw004 = 'Debbie LESKO . Mr. Speaker , I thank the gentleman from Florida ( Mr. Bilirakis ) for yielding to me . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of H.R . 3723 , the Consumer Safety Technology Act . This is important legislation that helps the U.S. solidify its position as a world leader in technology and innovation while protecting our constituents . This legislation builds on the American COMPETE Act , which sought to remove burdensome regulatory barriers to promote American innovation and consider how safely using artificial intelligence can transform the future . This is also a critical step in maintaining our global competitive edge in emerging technologies over foreign adversaries like China . It will make us less reliant on these bad actors for important technologies . The Consumer Safety and Technology Act establishes a pilot program to explore how to safely use artificial intelligence to protect consumers from unsafe products while advancing cutting-edge American innovation . Mr. Speaker , I urge my colleagues to support this legislation .'\n",
    "raw005 = 'Debbie STABENOW . Mr. President , it will come as no surprise to anyone in this Chamber that I am extremely proud to be born and raised in Michigan . Our State leads the world in innovation . We are the leaders in making things -- furniture , appliances , wind turbines and solar components and so much more , and , of course , we are the home of the automobile and the automotive assembly line and the middle class of America . Our workers put the world on four wheels . They built an economy strong enough that those same workers could afford to buy one or two or more cars and trucks that they made . Yet our Nation faces a stark choice right now , and that is why the bill in front of us tonight is so very important . We can continue to invest in making things in America or we can decide that it is not really worth the trouble anymore . We can continue to lead the world in the research and development of breakthrough technologies or we can allow other countries to surge ahead while we tread water . And we can stand with our workers on the assembly lines as they build the vehicles of the future or we can watch our plants close , ship our jobs overseas , and let our middle class wither away -- our choice . But I would argue that we may have no choice . That is no choice at all . We know what we need to do . It is time to stand on the side of American manufacturing , as this bill does . It is time to stand on the side of American ingenuity , as this bill does . And it is time to stand on the side of American workers and our American middle class . It is time to take a stand and invest in our shared future and build an economy that can compete with anyone , anywhere , anytime . That is America . That is what the U.S . Innovation and Competition Act does . One of our first orders of business is to increase our investments in research and development , and we have no time to lose . American R & D spending is [ [ Page S3852 ] ] near the lowest point in 60 years -- lowest point in 60 years . What else happened 60 years ago ? Well , the first person flew into space , and he was not an American . That fact helped light a fire under American leaders . They understood that we could invest in R & D or let the Soviet Union surge ahead , and we did . Today , we are in a race with China , and they are gaining on us . In 2019 , China  investment in R & D grew by about 13 percent . Ours grew 8 percent . And they plan to boost R & D spending by 7 percent each year through 2025 . That is why it is so important that we pass the U.S . Innovation and Competition Act . It will invest $ 120 billion over 5 years in critical -- critical -- research , including artificial intelligence , advanced computing , and semiconductors . And it will quadruple the investment for the manufacturing extension partnership and provides $ 1.2 billion for the Manufacturing USA Program that is especially important to Michigan . We are proud to have two Manufacturing USA initiatives in our State -- Lightweight Innovations for Tomorrow , or LIFT , and Michigan State University  Scale-up Research Facility , or SURF . Both are located in the same facility in Detroit , and it is a very exciting place . LIFT  projects include research into better welding processes for Navy ships and an anti-rollover system for military humvees . SURF is partnering with the Department of Energy and Ford and GM to make sure that America is a leader in advanced vehicle technologies . We are equally proud of our amazing research institutions , including Michigan State University , the University of Michigan , Wayne State , and Michigan Tech . Today  students are tomorrow  engineers . We know that . We are counting on their brain power to build a future in which cars are connected and collisions are a memory . That future is being written today at the American Center for Mobility in Michigan and Mcity at the University of Michigan , where connected and automated vehicles are tested , evaluated , and demonstrated . It is really amazing to see . It is being written by Michigan automakers , who are working towards the day where cars are emission-free -- emission-free . I know that President Biden was impressed by Ford  new F-150 Lightning that he test drove in Michigan last week . I think it was hard to get him out of the car . He thought it was so cool . Last month , I toured GM  new Factory Zero , which will soon be manufacturing electric Hummers and Silverado trucks , Chevy Silverado trucks . In Detroit , Stellantis , formerly known as Chrysler , is gearing up to build hybrid electric versions of an iconic American vehicle , the Jeep . It is what we have always done in Michigan . We make things , and we grow things . That is what we do . Unfortunately , making things has gotten more difficult recently . COVID-19 exposed the weaknesses in our supply chain , and a shortage of semiconductors has idled multiple auto plants across the country and many in Michigan . Auto dealers that are normally packed with every make and model under the Sun suddenly have fewer choices . Worse , Michigan workers have been laid off -- no chips , no cars , no work . It is not enough to just build cars that are made in America . To remain competitive in the global marketplace , we need to build the component parts that go into the cars and trucks that we build in America -- the supply chain . In 1990 , 37 percent of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity was here in the United States -- 37 percent . Today , it is 12 percent . They are definitely going in the wrong direction , and this is very serious . And the importance of these chips keep growing . Other countries have invested in chip manufacturing . It is time we do the same . The U.S . Innovation and Competition Act provides $ 39 billion in the Commerce Department for incentives that will boost semiconductor manufacturing in the United States and make our supply chain more resilient . It includes $ 2 billion to incentivize the production of mature semiconductor technologies -- the kinds of chips used by our auto companies and home appliances and defense manufacturing . I am pleased that yesterday the Finance Committee passed the Clean Energy for America Act , which will help Michigan and our country launch the next generation of Michigan manufacturing . It includes my bipartisan legislation with Senator Manchin and Senator Daines to help companies invest in new clean energy manufacturing facilities and expand existing plants to build those new technologies , including semiconductors and battery operations . Another way we can boost American manufacturing is to make sure every single American taxpayer dollar possible is spent on American-made products . My bipartisan Make it in America Act with Senator Warren makes it harder for Federal Agencies to use waivers or loopholes to get around `` Buy American '' rules to purchase foreign-made products . I also want to thank Tammy Baldwin and Senator Sherrod Brown for their continued leadership on these `` Buy American '' issues . The Federal Government is an enormous consumer , and we are set to make big infrastructure investments . `` Buy American '' rules means that American dollars flow into local economies when we purchase American- made PPE , American-made iron and steel , and great American electric vehicles . It is time to invest in the research and development that turn American ingenuity into American innovation and U.S. ingenuity into U.S. innovation . It is time to build an American supply chain that can build American products and American jobs in American communities . And it is time to ensure that American tax dollars are supporting those businesses and those workers . I am proud to say Michigan workers built our Nation . It is time for our Nation to return the favor . The bill this evening on the floor is a critical step forward in making sure that happens . I yield the floor . '\n",

Mr. Speaker , the Federal Government should put the incredible technological innovation of the last few years to work for the American people , and that is exactly what this bill does . It promotes the use of artificial intelligence in product safety and studies how blockchain can protect consumers . { time } 1500 Regulators will be stronger and the American consumer safer when we consider how these technologies can help them achieve this mission . Part of the mission of the Federal Trade Commission is to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive business practices . It is important to keep track of any such practices in the digital token ecosystem where unscrupulous businesspeople may be seeking to take advantage of the vast wealth created by digital tokens . This bill directs the Federal Trade Commission to report on its work keeping users of the digital token system safe . Emerging technologies pose both perils and promise . That is why we must direct Federal agencies to make sure that consumers are safe .'\n",
    "raw007 = 'Fred KELLER . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of H.R . 3533 , the Federal Career Opportunities in Computer Science Work Act . In a world that increasingly relies on digital technologies , the Federal Government needs to be able to hire and attract the right talent ; therefore , the ability to recruit and retain qualified software and data professionals is important , particularly as our government and private sector must withstand more frequent and sophisticated cybersecurity threats . The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence released their final report earlier this year and found that `` Digitally talented people should be able to reasonably expect to spend a career performing meaningful work focused on their field of expertise in government . '' The report goes on to recommend that new Federal career fields in digital technologies be established by creating new civilian occupational series for software development , software engineering , knowledge management , and data science . The bill under consideration requires the Office of Personnel Management to either update existing occupational series or create new ones in the fields of software development , software engineering , data management , and data science . This will ensure that the Federal workforce represents current specialized fields necessary to bringing the Government of America into the 21st century . The bill also enables the Federal Government to better target recruiting and retain qualified professionals in these essential fields . I appreciate the leadership of Congressman Obernolte and Congressman Welch on this issue . I encourage my colleagues to support this smart government modernization bill . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . '\n",
    "raw008 = 'Jay OBERNOLTE . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of my bill , the Federal Career Opportunities in Computer Sciences Work Act . Mr. Speaker , I , along with most of the country , was recently horrified by the cyberattacks against critical parts of our national infrastructure , in particular , the cyberattack against Colonial Pipeline that shut down gasoline deliveries for much of the Eastern United States and the cyberattacks against JBS meat processing , which disrupted operations at one of the largest food processing facilities in our country . It has become increasingly clear that dealing with these threats will require highly trained professionals in the computer sciences and the data sciences as part of not just our civilian workforce but also our Federal workforce . Unfortunately , many people are surprised to learn that we do not currently have Federal career occupational series that are dedicated to the computer sciences . This bill , the Federal Career Opportunities in Computer Sciences Work Act , will establish those series in such fields as data management , artificial intelligence , and software engineering . This will enable our Federal Government to better attract and retain the highly qualified technical computer scientist talent that is needed to respond to these attacks in the future . This is bipartisan legislation . It is an easy and commonsense solution to this problem , and I urge support for this bill . Mr. KELLER . Mr. Speaker , I have no further speakers , and I am prepared to close . Mr. Speaker , I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation that will help improve the technical skills of our Federal workforce and , ultimately , modernize our government .

    "raw009 = 'Gwen MOORE of Wisconsin . Mr. Speaker , I thank the gentlewoman for yielding . [ [ Page H3219 ] ] I rise today in support of H.R . 3593 , the Department of Energy Science for the Future Act . As a newly minted member of the Science , Space , and Technology Committee , I was so proud to see my colleagues on both sides of the aisle work so hard on this bill to pass it through committee with amendments from both Democrats and Republicans . I , too , had an opportunity as a newly minted member to make an impact on this important legislation . And I think that it was not by accident , and I thank the chairwoman of the committee , Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson and Representative Lucas , the ranking member , for creating the environment in which we could do our work and craft this important legislation . As you all have heard , the Department of Energy Office of Science is a hub of technological advancement and research designed to tackle our greatest scientific challenges facing the United States . Through several hearings in the committee , we learned about the ongoing efforts of the DOE Office of Science to support research and to find solutions . This bill allows the Office of Science to continue carrying out nondefense research on a vast array of critical areas . It supports research to modernize our energy infrastructure , allowing us the tools to overhaul our outdated energy grid to more climate-friendly solutions . And we , of course , have seen some of the catastrophic events caused by the lack of current technologies that recognize the climate action . It funds continuing studies in artificial intelligence and quantum computing , keeping pace with our competitors in the tech sector and readying our cybersecurity defenses from our adversaries , as we have seen up close and personal the cost to our country to not keep abreast of these technologies . During markup , I was able to offer a provision that was included in the bill that is before the House today that would prioritize clean water and watershed research at the Office of Science . My amendment directs the Office of Science to support clean water and watershed research that increases the quality and quantity of water across America , including the treasured Great Lakes . My home district of Milwaukee shares a coast with Lake Michigan , which I consider one of my most important constituents . It is imperative that we study the harmful effects of water pollution , make investments in technologies to combat the contamination of our waterways , and to protect drinking water sources that are critical to every man , woman , and child . We also need to make sure that water continues to be a resource for commerce . My amendment also ensures that relevant communities , research institutions , and nonprofits will be at the table when DOE carries out these tasks . Innovation does not occur in a vacuum , and it is critical that these research efforts have real world input from key stakeholders . Before I close , I want to mention something about the National Science Foundation , H.R . 2225 , which we considered on this floor today . I thank the chair and the ranking member for leaning in again to put this together in giving Members an opportunity to weigh in . As you all know , the NSF is the funder of more than 1,800 institutions in the United States , and they provide tremendous resources , funding , and opportunities for STEM students . I have been able to weigh in to make sure that there is diversity and opportunity in STEM . I urge my colleagues to support H.R . 3593 , the Department of Energy Science for the Future Act .'\n",
    "raw010 = 'Randy WEBER of Texas . Mr. Speaker , I thank Ranking Member Lucas and the chairwoman of the full committee , Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson . With this bill , the two of them have perfectly demonstrated how a committee can actually function -- even with occasional disagreements -- to prioritize shared goals and produce truly great bipartisan products . They are to be congratulated . Mr. Speaker , I rise today in strong support of H.R . 3593 , the Department of Energy Science for the Future Act . After over a decade of budget requests , hearings , stakeholder input , and information-gathering , I say with a sigh of relief and a great deal of joy that the Committee on Science , Space , and Technology has a bipartisan and comprehensive Office of Science authorization . Although it has taken a little longer than I would have expected , it could not come at a better time . American scientific enterprise has never faced a more serious threat from global competition than it does right now -- today . Innovative science discoveries and advance technology development are not just aspirations ; they are the actual key to our national security , as well as our economic prosperity . That is because innovation and technology are exactly what the Chinese Communist Party has prioritized in its goal to overtake the United States of America as a global leader in industries of the future . Mr. Speaker , if we want to maintain our key edge in technology areas , like quantum information science and artificial intelligence , and combat the threat of another country controlling the development of those cutting-edge technologies and standards , we must take action now . Mr. Speaker , the solution is really quite simple . We have to invest in American innovation . Just that simple . We must invest in our facilities and our research right here in the United States so that we can ensure the United States remains the global leader in science . How exactly we go about that might be the subject of some debate , but I fully believe that the bill that we have before us today is the best course of action . The Department of Energy Office of Science has time and time again demonstrated that basic science research is the most effective way to encourage development of those new technologies . And as the largest Federal sponsor of basic research in the physical sciences , with unparalleled research capabilities and infrastructure , the Office of Science and its national laboratories are uniquely equipped to help America compete . By authorizing cutting-edge research programs with a responsible , scalable funding increase and a strategic roadmap for DOE , federally funded discoveries made through the Office of Science will pave the way for both public and private American innovators to license technologies and to launch those startups . Mr. Speaker , in addition , the Office of Science research in materials and chemical science , biological and environmental research , and fusion energy will not only maintain our lead in science , but will also lay the foundation for the next generation of clean , secure , and exportable energy technologies . Do not miss that : Clean , exportable , and secure technologies . Maximizing the role of the Office of Science in our Federal research enterprise is how we win . This great legislative body and the Federal Government as a whole can not and will not duplicate a nonmarket economy by forcing mandates and regulations . Instead , we can arm our dynamic private sector with the tools necessary to commercialize sustainable , affordable , and scalable energy solutions . Again , do not miss that . Through the DOE Science of the Future Act , we are prioritizing critical research areas and investing in the science and technology that will drive development of those technologies into the next generation . This will allow  the economy of America o thrive while reducing global emissions and allowing market-based solutions to flourish . Do not miss that . Robust and consistent support for the Office of Science is crucial to the success and security of the U.S. innovation ecosystem , U.S. energy independence , and U.S. security . Mr. Speaker , this bill does that in a clear , streamlined fashion . It is not bogged down by outside interests or unrelated provisions . We will not just keep up with China and other foreign adversaries ; we will outpace them and lead , just like the United States of America has always done . That is a good thing . That is a very good thing , by the way . [ [ Page H3220 ] ] Mr. Speaker , I take a moment to thank the many stakeholders who have worked so hard to get this critical legislation done right . Hats off to all of them . Mr. Speaker , I urge my colleagues to support this bill . It is a great one . It is high time we had this one on the floor .'\n",
    "raw011 = 'Louie GOHMERT . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of amendment 165 . It creates a separate career track for military judges to prevent undue influence from command above . In the 1970s it was seen that it would be good for trial defense attorneys to have a separate track so that they were not rated by the same person who was pushing to have a court martial . That created some problems and at times some abuses . The separation and the creation of a trial defense service served a great purpose , but before 2004 each of the judge advocates general of the armed services subscribed to the policy that all judge advocates should have a broad career and move from job to job . They became quite good at all trades but masters of none . So junior judge advocates would try a few court martials , then move from one job to another . It gave them a broad basis , but it was not helpful overall . By giving the military judges a separate career track , it will ensure avoidance of undue command influence and will give our servicemembers the fair trials they deserve . I would encourage everyone to vote for this amendment .'\n",
    "raw012 = 'Tom COLE . Madam Speaker , I rise today to highlight important research being conducted by the University of Oklahoma , which is advancing cutting-edge developments in the areas of Air Defense Artillery , air dominance , ocean surveillance , ISR , EW , counter-UAS , GMTI , and a host of others . The developments I refer to center most directly in the budding area of all-digital radar . New capabilities associated with all-digital radar present an extraordinary opportunity for the United States to better utilize important data for national security purposes , be it weather data , flight control data , projectile data , targeting data or any other type , to our tactical and operational advantage -- land or sea . Madam Speaker , in the area of distributed radar and 360-degree , all- digital , phased array radars , there are extraordinary leap-ahead capabilities which can not be ignored . By bringing to bear advances in digital signal processing , artificial intelligence , and machine learning to the data streams that this new technology provides , the defense of the United States can be significantly advanced , providing leapfrog capabilities which vastly exceed those of our legacy radars . Over time , all of the services have been engaged in developing capabilities in this area , albeit at a rate that does not always achieve the leap-ahead and transformational requirements that we now require strategically as we focus on defense from potential near-peer adversaries . While we currently maintain many advantages , technology advances quickly around the globe . It is critical we maintain our edge , and , in doing so , obtain the generational leap-ahead needed to secure it . Madam Speaker , the Advanced Radar Research Center ( ARRC ) in Norman , Oklahoma , has conducted very significant research in this area . A component of the research enterprise of the University of Oklahoma , the ARRC has generated important technological advancements to each major service component in the area of 360-degree phased array radars . In fact , to help further this contribution , I am supporting a National Defense Authorization Act proposal this year , initiated in the Senate , which encourages the Army Research Lab to collaborate with academia in the development of distributed radars and multi-function sensors . This is an area where I believe there will be plenty of bipartisan and bicameral support . Madam Speaker , Army Research Lab in many ways has stepped forward for the Army in this area . I am confident that , as the Army Combat Capabilities Development Command , Army Futures Command , and the ASA/ALT examine what can be accomplished in this area , they will quickly realize the high relevance of this technology to counter-UAS , Air Defense Artillery , and their EW enterprise . It has the potential to be one of the key transformational technologies that would allow the Army to leverage ground forces more effectively and to provide better defensive capabilities against airborne threats . As the Department of Defense proceeds to develop technology in this area , we already see interest from the private sector . However , if we do not develop a joint approach to the development of this technology , it may result in it being stove-piped into systems without ever realizing the full extent of its capabilities . Furthermore , inability or unwillingness to coordinate research in this area could tax current supply chains and threaten the rate of development we are capable of in this area . Additionally , application of this technology is not limited solely to the defense enterprise . Air traffic control , weather prediction and analysis , 5G frequency scanning dependent communications , and remote sensing could all benefit ; NOAA is already engaged in related research . Therefore , over time , it may become beneficial to create a Joint Interagency Working Group on the development of distributed and all digital radar . Madam Speaker , the future is bright for the development of these technologies in the United States . It is an area in which we can thrive . I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate to advance our common interests and our national defense by supporting the development of these technologies .'\n",
    "raw013 = 'Susan COLLINS . Mr. President , I rise to introduce the STEM Education in Accounting Act with my colleague Senator Rosen . Our bill would recognize accounting as part of a well-rounded STEM education and allow school districts to use their Federal education [ [ Page S9215 ] ] block grant resources to develop and improve instruction in accounting . It also aims to introduce more students to accounting and improve career awareness and workforce diversity in the field . In the rapidly changing world of today , improving the access of students to a STEM-based curriculum is increasingly vital to ensure they are prepared to succeed in the 21st-century workforce . Mathematics -- the `` M '' in `` STEM '' -- is a critical skill that can help students unlock countless doors to high-paying , in-demand fields . One of those doors leads to the accounting profession , whose work has a direct impact on employers , employees , retirees , investors , and the global economy . Certified professional accountants , or CPAs , play a key role in providing capital markets with confidence in financial reporting . Modern accounting increasingly requires cutting-edge math and technology skills , including IT auditing , artificial intelligence , data analytics , and cyber security , to keep up with the needs of the market. Under the Every Student Succeeds Act , which is current law , school districts may use funds from the Student Support and Academic Enrichment Program to support a host of curricular and extracurricular activities that deliver a well-rounded education to students in all grade levels . Specifically , the STEM Education in Accounting Act would add `` activities to promote the development , implementation , and strengthening of programs to teach accounting '' to the list of courses and activities supported by this flexible block grant . Our bill would also promote high-quality accounting instruction for members of groups underrepresented in the accounting profession . Encouraging a robust pipeline of future accounting professionals is paramount . I encourage my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill to promote accounting education , improve finance skills of students, and strengthen the pipeline of future accountants , who play such a vital role in our financial system .

    "raw014 = 'Marcy KAPTUR . Madam Speaker , as co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine , Hungary , and Poland Caucuses , Member of the Baltic Caucus , and friend to liberty-lovers across Central and Eastern Europe , I rise to introduce the bipartisan Transatlantic Telecommunications Security Act . I am thankful to my colleague Congressman Kinzinger of Illinois for his co-leadership and partnership on this measure , as well as his commitment to liberty in Europe . The United States and our NATO allies and partners in Central and Eastern Europe face down increased threats from global actors like a rising China and a belligerent Russia that seek to export their malign influence and undermine democratic institutions . China seeks to compromise allied critical digital infrastructure by using state-linked companies like Huawei and ZTE to unfairly induce our allies to procure insecure telecommunications equipment and services . Given immense economic potential from rapid 50 deployment , European countries feel significant pressure to use dangerous Huawei equipment despite the political risks . Bipartisan current and former U.S. officials and civil society members have recognized the threat of malign influence over critical telecommunications networks . 5G networks will serve as the backbone of artificial intelligence platforms with immense national security and domestic economic implications . Given these critical national security needs , the United States must provide our allies alternatives to Chinese financing and provide increased diplomatic support to our allies to ensure secure telecommunications lines . This legislation would authorize the U.S. Development Finance Corporation to provide financing for cross-border 5G telecommunications infrastructure development to our allies . This financing is key to remove risky and threatening equipment and replace it with secure equipment . The legislation seeks to increase resilience in countries in the region whose infrastructure deficit from the Soviet-era makes them especially vulnerable to malign Chinese influence , including among nations in the Three Seas Initiative . Additionally , this bill directs the Secretary of State and other relevant agency heads to prioritize diplomacy and project support with European allies and partners to develop 5G markets that are inclusive , transparent , economically viable , socially sustainable , and compliant with international law . Finally , this legislation ensures the United States is leading with our European allies to develop international SG standards that favor democratic institutions , not further authoritarianism spread by China and Russia . I am so thankful for the support of the Central and East Europe Coalition , the National Federation of Croatian Americans , as well as the embassies of Czechia , Estonia , Kosovo , Latvia , Lithuania , North Macedonia , Poland , and Slovenia . The U.S. Congress must act to ensure the security of our NATO allies and partners . I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation and look forward to working with Rep. Kinzinger towards the passage of this bill. '\n",
    "raw015 = 'Zoe LOFGREN . Mr. Speaker , I thank the gentleman for yielding . Mr. Speaker , I rise in strong support of this amendment that would allow a small number of special immigrant visas to the top scientists and technical experts of the world selected by the Secretary of Defense . I trust the Secretary of Defense looking out after the security interests of the Nation, and it is important that our security depends on having access to the top scientists in the world who are committed to the success of our country . We need to take bold action to make sure that we educate and train our American people to be the best scientists they can be . But that does not mean that every smart person who loves America was born in America . In fact , some of the most patriotic people I have ever met were immigrants who came here and became Americans by choice . It is absolutely clear that nations that attract and retain highly- skilled innovators gain a competitive advantage , and we can help do that for America through this very thoughtful plan . For us , the promise of the American Dream remains a powerful draw for the innovators of the world . This amendment would move us in the right direction and help ensure that America , and not our competitors , benefits from the best minds of the world . I want to thank Mr. Langevin for this smart amendment , and I urge its adoption .'\n",
    "raw016 = 'Scott PETERS . Mr. President , as we emerge from the coronavirus pandemic , we have a real opportunity to revitalize American manufacturing and harness American leadership in scientific and technological advancement . Today I urge my colleagues to support critical , bipartisan legislation that will do just that . The United States Innovation and Competition Act will help keep our country on the cutting edge of technology , strengthen American competitiveness on a global stage , and protect our national security . International competitors like the Chinese Government are aggressively investing in manufacturing , science , and technology in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage over the United States , and we can not let that happen . In order to maintain our edge , we must make serious investments in domestic research and development , technology , and manufacturing . We know that a strong manufacturing sector is the backbone of any economy . I have long believed that you can not be a great country if you do not make things . This bill contains a number of provisions to help revitalize and strengthen American manufacturing . A provision in this bill that Senator Stabenow and I led will provide $ 2 billion in new funding for the domestic production of mature semiconductor technologies that are absolutely critical to the automotive industry and other manufacturers all across our country . This provision is essential because our reliance on overseas semiconductor manufacturing is a threat to our economy and to our national security . We are currently experiencing a semiconductor shortage that is causing massive supply chain disruptions and has idled plants in Michigan and other States across our country , forcing auto manufacturers to shut down factories and lay off workers . This is a completely unacceptable situation , and we must immediately work to address this challenge . [ [ Page S3857 ] ] Boosting manufacturing in Michigan and across the Nation requires a comprehensive Federal strategy to help companies grow our domestic manufacturing base . That is why I authored a provision in this legislation to reactivate the Manufacturing Advisory Council and worked to increase funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program , a program that helps small- and medium-sized manufacturers grow their companies and create jobs . Together , these policies will help strengthen our manufacturing sector , advance our economic competitiveness , and create good-paying jobs . The United States Innovation and Competition Act also helps ensure that when we are spending American taxpayer dollars , we are investing in American manufacturers and creating American jobs . As chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , I was proud of our committee  efforts to include several bipartisan provisions in this package that will strengthen `` Buy American '' requirements . These provisions , including one based on a bill Senator Stabenow and I introduced , will ensure that American taxpayer dollars are being used to buy American-made products and close loopholes that have allowed the use of Chinese- and Russian-made steel rather than using U.S. steel . Growing good-paying jobs in America must always be our focus , and passing this bill will do just that . This package also includes a provision to secure our supply chain and address the serious national security risks posed by our overreliance on companies in China and other countries for medical supplies . During the pandemic , we saw firsthand how our country  overreliance on foreign manufacturers for critical supplies , such as personal protective equipment , left us unprepared to combat the pandemic and cost American lives . This bill takes important steps to address that , thanks to a provision I worked on with Senator Portman to encourage investments that will expand domestic production of personal protective equipment here in the United States . These provisions and so many more will help us unleash American innovation , lock in our competitive advantage , and grow our economy , but that alone is not enough . We must also protect our advantage . That is why our committee worked to include critical provisions in this legislation to strengthen cyber security and protect against increasingly sophisticated efforts by adversarial governments and criminal organizations to steal our research and intellectual property . Cyber attacks pose a significant threat to our national security , and cyber attacks have significant real-world consequences . We saw this with the recent Colonial Pipeline attack . This bill includes provisions I authored to strengthen the Federal Government  capabilities to prevent and respond to a significant cyber incident , creates a fund that can help entities recover from serious breaches , and strengthens our Federal cyber workforce , therefore ensuring our workers have the skills and knowledge to build a competitive advantage and secure our networks from these attacks . From spurring advancements in artificial intelligence to securing taxpayer-funded research and intellectual property from adversaries who try to steal it , this legislation takes significant steps to help ensure American companies and workers will continue to lead the way in developing the technologies and economy of the future . The process we followed to write this legislation shows that when we work together in a bipartisan manner , we can tackle the biggest challenges facing our Nation . I am grateful to my colleagues for all of their hard work , and I look forward to continuing to partner with our House counterparts to get these important provisions signed into law . I yield the floor . I suggest the absence of a quorum .'\n",
    "raw017 = 'Donald Edwin Young Mr. President , I want to begin by thanking my colleagues : Senator Schumer , Senator Wicker , and Senator Cantwell . All showed exceptional leadership over the course of drafting this legislation and ensuring that it made it through the process . I also want to thank members of my team : Lauren OBrien , my legislative director ; Brandt Anderson , my national security adviser ; Dan Cheever ; Nancy Martinez , on my ledge staff . They went above and beyond . So this piece of legislation , yes , it , indeed , is related to countering the threat that the Chinese Communist Party presents to this country . But it also is a piece of legislation that we are considering at a time when so many of our citizens feel overlooked , when the intimate communities that they call home feel hollowed out , when trust in our civic institutions is eroding , and when allegiance seems increasingly to our political tribes and not to one another on behalf of the common good . So let us not kid ourselves . The Chinese Communist Party aims to exploit all of these divisions . They aim to exploit the insecurities of the global age . They aim to ensure that their power and their capabilities continue to grow . And they are , indeed , locked in a global competition with the United States of America and with our partners and allies . So let us do what we have always done as Americans in times like this . Let us come together , and let us use this as an opportunity to become a better version of ourselves . I will end with this . When generation after generation of immigrants have come into the New York Harbor , they have seen that beautiful Statue of Liberty . And at the base of the Statue of Liberty is a sonnet , and everyone here in this Chamber and so many across America are familiar with the words of that sonnet : `` Give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses . . . `` There is also a line in there that I particularly love about `` imprisoned lightning  -- `` imprisoned lightning .  I am not sure what Emma Lazarus meant by the phrase `` imprisoned lightning ,  but to me that `` imprisoned lightning  refers to the untapped potential , the God-given potential of every human being . And this legislation , the Endless Frontier Act , aims to tap into that `` imprisoned lightning  of people across the heartland to ensure that they can stay part of the economic game in the 21st century and that they help us outcompete , outinnovate , and outgrow the Chinese Communist Party . We will win . We are going to get a great vote today , and I thank all of my colleagues for their intention to support this legislation .'\n",

    "raw019 = 'Cynthia LUMMIS . Mr. President , I am excited to announce the founding of the Senate Financial Innovation Caucus with my friend and cochair , the Senator from Arizona . I am delighted that you also have joined our caucus . We are grateful for your participation and look forward to working with you . One of my top priorities and a legacy I hope to leave in this Chamber is to ensure the United States remains a global leader in financial services for future generations . The U.S. dollar is the world unquestioned reserve currency . Since the Second World War , this leadership role has given our country enormous advantages , including affordable credit and trade finance . China is not hiding its ambition to knock the U.S. dollar down a peg by offering a competitor payment system that sidesteps the United States . This year , the Chinese Government launched a pilot program for their digital yuan in multiple cities around China . They expect to completely release the central bank digital currency at the 2022 Winter Olympics . A video released by China state-controlled media in December of 2020 openly stated that the digital yuan will allow China to `` actively participate in reforming world economic governance '' and is `` one of the building blocks of China move toward world market status and greater involvement in setting the framework of the global economy . '' China does not share the same values as our country relating to fair competition . This chilling reality is one of the many reasons the United States must advance financial innovation and do so now . China is serious about the future . Chinese President Xi stated in 2018 that financial innovation is `` the new industrial revolution . '' In another part of the world , digital assets are protecting many Venezuelans during their current economic crisis and ensuring corrupt government officials can not seize or devalue their hard-earned savings . The U.S. Government is also using digital assets to achieve its foreign policy objectives and to provide humanitarian aid to Venezuelan groups faster than traditional channels . We must work hard today to ensure the next generation of Americans can enjoy the opportunity and prosperity made possible by responsible innovation . Failure to do so could have astronomical impacts on the freedoms and privileges that are essential to the American dream . I have been encouraged by early signs from the Biden administration that they understand the existential threat of China and the promise of financial innovation . China moves alone should create a sense of urgency in this Chamber to take action . But it is not just a threat from China that should motivate us . In addition to [ [ Page S3481 ] ] protecting the U.S. position as the world leader in the financial system , proper regulations for financial innovation will have lasting effects in the financial industry in several ways , notably financial inclusion and entrepreneurship because financial innovation encompasses topics as diverse as faster payment and equities settlement , central bank digital currencies , financial inclusion , digital assets , distributed ledger technology , consumer protection , artificial intelligence , and machine learning . This area has remained bipartisan , following in the tradition of many other financial service issues . The Financial Innovation Caucus is rigorously committed to the tradition of bipartisanship and will create a lasting legacy by doing so . Innovation is core to the American identity , and innovation is not confined to one party . Our job here is to create a framework that allows innovation to take root . Regulatory certainty fosters entrepreneurial innovation . A lack of regulatory clarity , on the flip side , strangles regulation , restrains entrepreneurship . In many cases , financial innovators are simply hungry to know the rules of the road and how they fit into existing law . We need a right- sized regulatory framework for financial technology that both enables new market opportunities and emphasizes consumer protection . The innovator too often loses when competing against business giants with lobbying arms . Together , we can craft regulations that foster innovation , not stifle or unnecessarily direct it . We also need a new consumer protection framework for emerging tech , which promotes access and innovation but ensures appropriate guardrails are in place . Innovators are the lifeblood of America . Each new idea strengthens our future . Innovators have done hard work in coming up with ideas which will bring underserved populations into the financial system , reduce systemic risk , and strengthen our competitive nature on the global stage . Yet there is only so much innovators can accomplish due to our maze of financial regulations . American innovators need clear rules of the road so they can responsibly turn innovation into reality . It is our obligation as government officials to create a framework that clearly enables responsible innovation rather than stifling it . We must do a great deal more in the coming years to clarify and modernize our financial laws . Citibank , Goldman Sachs , Avanti Bank and Trust , State Street , Deutsche Bank , Kraken , and other large financial institutions are now doing much more than dipping their toes into this realm . They are diving into the financial technology and digital asset markets . Financial innovation is here to stay . Younger generations are turning to and prioritizing technology for their investments . In February , CNBC reported that there may be as many as 100,000 millionaires from the appreciation of digital assets like Bitcoin . These technologies , if harnessed wisely , see no color , no creed , and no sex But financial innovation is not limited to regulating digital assets . This caucus will also focus on issues like faster payments , including a U.S. central bank digital currency and FedNow , which have real potential to allow all Americans to receive their paychecks instantly . The lack of real-time payments costs disadvantaged Americans millions in overdraft fees each year and would reduce many Americans reliance on high-interest loans . It also traps large amounts of capital for companies , which could be deployed more productively . Tackling these issues will help bring millions of unbanked or underbanked Americans into our financial system . In Wyoming , we live by the doctrine that you have to pull yourself up by your bootstraps . What you earn is a direct result of your hard work . All Americans should have access to their hard-earned money and investments whenever they would like . We can and should use innovation technologies to reduce settlement times in our payment networks and capital markets and to reduce systemic risk and improve transparency . Threats to the world economic system , coupled with the benefits financial innovation can create , is why , today , alongside many of my colleagues from both parties , we are founding the Senate Financial Innovation Caucus . The caucus is a bipartisan group committed to promoting responsible innovation to help the U.S. financial industry truly meet 21st century challenges of a globally interconnected economy and to harvest technology to make markets more inclusive , vibrant , and safe for all Americans . After all , our financial innovation is critical in our pursuit to ensure equal access to financial institutions and opportunities . It is my hope that the work done by the Financial Innovation Caucus will deliver comprehensive legislation to clarify , regulate , and protect American edge in the financial industry when it comes to innovation . We live in a digital world . Technology is now engrained in our everyday lives . Our lives should reflect this shift and should not hinder innovation . Only together can we secure the U.S. role in the future of finance . So let us go to work . I yield the floor .'\n",

    "raw021 = 'Jared GOLDEN . Madam Speaker , I rise in support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 . This measure , which passed out of our committee with a strong bipartisan vote , reflects our commitment to strengthening our national security and serving those who serve all of us . I am particularly proud of the efforts of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee . This bill reflects the constructive input of members of the subcommittee from both sides of the aisle and makes a strong mark on our national security priorities on , above , and below the seas . For shipbuilding , the bill expands on the budget request to authorize 13 battle force ships . This reflects the focused effort of our committee to scrub the budget and our shipbuilding plans to augment our Navy fleet responsibly and consistently in a manner which our industrial base can support to respond to emerging threats around the world . This includes the sustained construction of two Virginia-class submarines a year and continued production of the Columbia-class submarine program . We augment our surface capabilities by authorizing three new DDG 51 destroyers , one of our most capable surface platforms , and authorizing the Navy to seek a new contract for up to 15 ships over the next 5 years . This bill also continues the efforts of the committee to provide the Navy and Defense Department with tools needed to concurrently build the new 12 sub Columbia class without suffocating the rest of the fleet of the Navy . Specifically , the bill expands the authority of the National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund to allow for multiyear , continuous production of key components . Recent data from the Navy shows that the use of this authority since our subcommittee enacted it in 2015 has already saved the Navy $ 1.4 billion in the Columbia program to the tune of over $ 100 million per boat . This bill will increase those cost savings by expanding the scope of those tools to other components of the platform . The bill also includes full funding to start the new sealift Tanker Security Program , an initiative we passed last year to get more U.S.- built tankers to sea . The bill supports the budget request for the fifth planned National Security Multi-Mission Vessel , another initiative to boost maritime training and sealift capacity . At every step of the way , our subcommittee and the full committee accommodated many bipartisan initiatives throughout this process . That is how the legislative process should work , and we are proud that our committee remains a place for constructive bipartisan collaboration . Madam Speaker , on behalf of the security of our nation, I urge support for the bill . '\n",
    "raw022 = 'Joe COURTNEY . Madam Speaker , I rise in strong support of the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act , which is before us this evening . As chair of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee , this bill is proof that our panel upheld its duty under Article 1 , Section 8 `` to provide and maintain a Navy . '' Our bill authorizes 13 new ships , continuing our tradition to independently scrub the budget and augment our Navy fleet responsibly . Within that total , we authorize three destroyers and two additional Fast Transport ships to support the rapid deployment of equipment and personnel . The agreement also reflects our panel  ongoing efforts to recapitalize our aging sealift . The bill fully authorizes the new sealift Tanker Security Program , an initiative our panel started last year to meet gaps in our at-sea refueling capabilities . It also authorizes the fifth National Security Multi-Mission Vessel , another initiative our subcommittee led to boost maritime training and sealift capacity . Later this week , the historic Philly Shipyard will lay keel for the first in a series of NSMVs , which is tangible proof that our Nation can rebuild its decrepit sealift fleet with our [ [ Page H7218 ] ] domestic shipbuilding industrial base . To that end , this agreement rejects a request to further our reliance on used foreign-built sealift ships . Madam Speaker , of particular note , is the mark on undersea capabilities , which at the end of the day is the most effective path to deter the pacing threat of China . For proof of this , look no further than AUKUS , the recent security agreement between the U.S. , U.K. , and Australia , whose centerpiece is building a new fleet of Aussie nuclear- powered submarines . This NDAA funds two per year Virginia-class subs and full production of the Columbia program . It also includes House provisions of $ 200 million for a new facility , $ 130 million for supplier development , and $ 20 million for workforce development . Altogether , this will increase production capacity to help both our allies and our Navy to maintain dominance in the undersea domain . Madam Speaker , I thank Ranking Member Rob Wittman and all the members on the subcommittee for their great bipartisan work building the NDAA this year , as well as Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers . I also thank Phil McNaughton , Dave Sienicki , and Kelly Goggin for their great staff work , and Lieutenant Commander Matt Harmon , my Navy fellow , who is sadly leaving us soon . His really solid contribution as a SWO really was instrumental in terms of the work that our subcommittee was able to produce .'\n",
    "raw023 = 'Patrick McHENRY . Madam Speaker , I rise in support of S. 1605 , the National Defense Authorization Act ( NDAA ) for fiscal year 2022 . Debt Bondage is a terrible crime , and many victims find themselves trapped in a perpetual cycle of forced labor and coerced debt because of it . Helping these survivors regain their livelihood is a nonpartisan issue . Earlier this year , the Financial Services Committee held a hearing on the financing of human trafficking . We heard from powerful witnesses , including Reverend Doctor Marian Hatcher , who is a trafficking survivor . It was her story , which inspired my original bill H.R . 2332 , the Debt Bondage Repair Act . Dr. Hatcher , like too many in this country , fell victim to human traffickers . Thankfully , she was able to escape a terrible situation and restore her life . However , she struggled to reestablish herself because of her credit score , which was negatively affected by loans she was forced to obtain her traffickers . Madam Speaker , this is how these criminals trap an individual into a cycle of victimization . Traffickers will take out loans , open businesses , and destroy the credit of their victims , which forces them to remain a victim until they pay off the debt . Too often , these victims are never able to get out . Section 6102 in the final text has the potential to help thousands of victims every year by ensuring that a consumer reporting agency may not furnish a credit report with adverse information from a severe form of trafficking . While this does not erase the terrible crimes committed against them , it will help survivors to regain their financial freedom and begin to rebuild their lives . I will conclude by thanking Chairwoman Waters for passing my bill H.R . 2332 on suspension earlier this Congress , and for including my provision in the House NDAA base text . Additionally , I would like to thank the numerous trafficking advocacy groups and the Consumer Data Industry Association for their work on H.R . 2332 . I urge my colleagues to support the conference agreement . '\n",

Madam Speaker , I want to thank the distinguished chair of the House Armed Services Committee for all of his hard work in putting together , as he was just closing , what I think is a bill that is one of the best -- a lot of hard work that he has done . I thank the ranking member also . Madam Speaker , I rise today to speak in favor of passing this measure here before us today . Every year for the past six decades , Congress has passed a Defense authorization bill . This is an important bipartisan tradition , and I commend , as I said , Chairman Smith for his admirable work carrying out this legacy . Unfortunately , Congress has been asleep at the wheel when it comes to our State Department . We have not passed a comprehensive State Department authorization in nearly two decades . Congress has been attuned to defense for decades , but we have consistently left diplomacy out to dry . I am glad that tonight we will be ending this trend by passing out both a Defense authorization bill and a bipartisan State authorization bill contained therein . We need a State Department for the century ahead , not decades past , and my State authorization bill will now put us on that track . Now , no bill is perfect . Unfortunately , I am disappointed that there are some provisions that were not included in this NDAA . Saudi Arabian abuse against dissidents and civil society has continued since the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi , yet two bipartisan House provisions that addressed some of these human rights violations were dropped in the final package . Other amendments that would have ended needless civilian casualties resulting from the brutal war in Yemen were also removed by Senate Republicans , though we had a bipartisan agreement in this House . Finally , Madam Speaker , provisions promoting diversity and other management reforms at the State Department were also left out . These are just a few examples of where the bill falls a little short . Despite the efforts of many of our members of the Foreign Affairs Committee , and my own as chair , we were unable to secure the requisite support from Senate Republicans to advance important provisions in this final bill . Nevertheless , Madam Speaker , there are other important provisions contained in this NDAA , including State authorization , and I urge my colleagues to vote in the affirmative .'\n",
    "raw025 = 'Raja KRISHNAMOORTHI . Mr. Speaker , I urge support of my amendment , which would permit the Secretary of HHS to receive unused and oftentimes just about to expire COVID vaccines from States and be able to redistribute them to foreign partners or allies . Now , my primary legislation before the body in Congress is called NOVID . It is a play on words , no more COVID . And this legislation would actually establish a program to help vaccinate 60 percent of the population of the 92 poorest countries of the world. I hope that this legislation is taken up by this body and supported by the administration . In the meantime , the very least that we can do is to donate unused vaccines from the States . Now , these vaccines are about to expire . They are going to be no good in just a matter of months , and so instead of allowing them to go to waste , we should donate them abroad . This is not only the right thing to do to help to end suffering abroad , but it is the smart thing to do because then it helps to prevent variants that are generated abroad from coming back home to the United States and further wreaking havoc on our economy . On top of that , we see the Chinese Communist Party going around the world peddling their ineffective Sinovac vaccine , and we should be instead vaccinating those populations with effective vaccines . Again , I hope that the administration utilizes this amendment to great impact , and I hope that they also do more and endorse my NOVID legislation .'\n",

A bill was introduced , Members offered amendments , debated accordingly , and reached bicameral consensus . However , as Members arrived in Washington this afternoon , they realized they only had about 8 hours to review and vote on a 2,100-page document to secure our national defense -- a surprising and frustrating process that has become all too familiar with House Democrats and the majority . While I will always support our men and women in uniform , I am concerned that not all these men and women , specifically those who serve in the Army as explosive ordnance disposal technicians , as I once did , are adequately equipped to defend our Nation by the version of NDAA of this year. I will continue to work hard to achieve this purpose going forward . I am voting in favor of the legislation because of the critical funding it provides for our national defense , pay raises for our servicemen and -women , provisions to hold the Biden administration accountable on its irresponsible withdraw from Afghanistan , and serious steps to assess the involvement of the Chinese Communist Party in the origins of COVID-19 as well as their unacceptable and increasingly aggressive behavior around the world . I sincerely hope that next year we have more time to absorb the final provisions of the NDAA to make sure that all of our troops feel confident they have the full support of Congress .'\n",

Madam Speaker , this bill equips and modernizes our Armed Forces by carefully and thoughtfully managing resources . At the same time , this bill continues the necessary oversight to ensure responsibility of the execution by the DOD . This bill enacts : Vigorous oversight of our most complex and expensive program , the F-35 , certainly an ambitious modernization strategy by the Army and a host of others ; and of particular importance to me and Mrs. Hartzler , strong support for risk reduction in our defense industrial base . To this point , this bill also includes my Buy American provision , which brings back jobs to the U.S. and can ensure that we get what we need when we need it , securing our fragile supply chain .

Madam Speaker , I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers for their leadership in bringing this bill to the floor . This is our opportunity to pass the Defense Authorization Act for the 61st straight year . That is important . [ [ Page H7219 ] ] Madam Speaker , this bill continues the  long tradition of bipartisan work of the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee to make American Armed Forces continue to be the best in the world .

Our bipartisan cooperation in the House , once again , paid dividends in delivering a defense bill that meets the modernization and readiness needs of the air and land forces of our nation. Madam Speaker , this bill carefully manages our military resources while increasing our congressional oversight of the large , complex , and expensive programs of the DoD . Certainly , this is something that demands our attention and it certainly has . This billing includes significant compromises , many of which I personally do not agree with . This is a good bill , and it furthers American national security needs . Madam Speaker , I urge everyone to support this bill .'\n",

    "raw032 = 'Jon TESTER . Mr. President , I am pleased that the Senate has taken up the National Defense Authorization Act . There is a 60-year tradition in this body of getting this bill done because the importance of this bill transcends partisanship . In fact , 81 Senators of both parties joined forces earlier this year to override a senseless veto of this important bill by the former President . Now , while both sides of the aisle can work cooperatively to get this defense policy done , we are now seeing unprecedented -- unprecedented -- obstruction by the minority party for passing a budget that will fund the programs that our military and our veterans need . Now , look , if Republicans succeed in this obstruction , I am going to tell you that the government will be forced to go to a full-year continuing resolution . That is not workable . The result will be frozen spending levels for the Department of Defense and for the Department of Veterans Affairs , which amounts to a $ 70 billion cut in spending for those two Agencies alone , compared to the appropriations bills prepared in the U.S. Senate . I serve as chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee , and let me tell you what is at stake for American veterans and their families . Funding will be blocked for priorities like expanding veteran access to lifesaving mental healthcare services , enhancing women veteran healthcare , providing housing assistance , and expediting the delivery of benefits and care for those suffering from toxic exposure . Let me say this again . If we go to a 1-year continuing resolution , that means we go off of the budget  of last year, of the spending bill of last year . We will block priorities like expanding access to mental health services for our veterans . We will block services for expanding women veteran healthcare . We will block services for housing assistance and for expediting what is one of the most serious issues coming out of the conflict of 20 years in the Middle East , and that is care for those that are suffering from toxic exposure . The bottom line is this would keep the VA from properly addressing a whole host of issues on behalf of those who would put their lives on the line for this country , and they are going to continue to pay the price for us not doing our job . As chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee , I was able to draft a bill that provided a $ 31 billion increase for defense compared to last year . This military bill is consistent with the spending levels approved by [ [ Page S8418 ] ] the bill we are working on today . In fact , in an amendment offered by Senator Inhofe , that amendment passed 25 to 1 , which will plus-up this bill . So why is not the defense appropriations bill flying through this Senate just like the NDAA ? Well , I will tell you . In September , the Republicans on the Appropriations Committee announced they would vote against all appropriations bills in part because the bill of Senator Inhofe does not increase defense with enough spending . So the idea here is , just take money and throw it at the wall and hope that it is spent right . The bottom line is there needs to be plans and there needs to be planning . And I am going to tell you , the last time I checked , the $ 31 billion increase is a pretty good chunk of dough . So it is simple . Do we want to fund the VA ? Do we want to fund the military ? Do we want to fund the government of this country? Or do we want to go back to the funding of last year? Which , by the way , would be totally inadequate , but it is what some on the other side of the aisle are advocating right now . Look , guys , we are in a continuing resolution right now . It expires on December 3 . If , in fact , we had a budget deal today , we could not get an omnibus out for nearly 5 weeks . So what I am saying is this : no more finger pointing , no more changing the rules of the game , no more foot dragging . Do what the gang of 10 did on the bipartisan infrastructure package . Let us go into negotiations to get to yes . Let us all work together . Let us not play irresponsible political games with our military and with our veterans and with everybody else who lives in this country . What are we here for ? Are we here to advocate for this country ? Or are we here to advocate for a political party ? I am telling you the appropriations bills should have been done last September . We should be sitting at the table today . I am ready to roll up my sleeves and help in any way that I possibly can to make sure these bills get through this body and to the  desk of the President so we can fund our veterans and fund the needs that they have , so we can fund our military and deal with the threats that are facing us around the world . It is time , folks . It is time to quit talking , and it is time to start doing . I yield the floor .'\n",
    "raw033 = 'Chuck GRASSLEY . Mr. President , my fellow Senators : On November 4 of this year , I introduced an amendment to the national defense bill of this year. This amendment focuses on the Office of Net Assessment . That office is within the Pentagon . The purpose of the Office of Net Assessment is to produce an annual net assessment , which is a long-term look at our military capabilities and those of our greatest adversaries . In 2019 , when I began to look at the contracting work of  Stefan Halper for the Office of Net Assessment , something did not look right . So I asked the inspector general to look into it . For those who are unaware , Halper was a central figure in the debunked Russia collusion investigation . And I do not have to explain the Russia collusion investigation ; everybody in the U.S. Senate knows something about that and they know what it refers to . Halper secretly , at that time , recorded Trump campaign officials during Crossfire Hurricane . Halper also received over 1 million taxpayer dollars from the Office of Net Assessment for several research projects . But the question is : Were they really research projects ? But the inspector general found some problems with his contract : The Office of Net Assessment did not require Halper to submit evidence that he actually talked to the people he cited in his work , which included Russian intelligence officers . Secondly , the Office of Net Assessment could not provide sufficient documentation that Halper conducted all of his work in accordance with the law . Thirdly , the Office of Net Assessment did not maintain sufficient documents to comply with all of the Federal contracting requirements and the guidelines of the OMB. The inspector general also found that these problems were not unique to the contract of Halper . This is the inspector general speaking up on this . I am reporting what he said . So these findings indicate systemic issues within the Office of Net Assessment in the Pentagon . Moreover , this office has spent the money of taxpayers on research projects unconnected to net assessments . In other words , they are spending money and wasting money that does not deal very closely with our national defense . Two cases in point : The office funded a report titled `` On the Nature of Americans as a Warlike People : Workshop Report . '' Now , that report highlighted the `` level of American belligerency which is the result of the persistence of Scotch-Irish culture in America . '' That ought to get a lot of your attention . What does that have to do with the assessment of the capability of us to deliver on the constitutional responsibility of the Federal Government to the defense of the American people ? Or what does that have to do with our assessing the capability of our enemies ? Yet another report focused on Vladimir Putins neurological development and potential Aspergers diagnosis . Now , I have highlighted these reports for the Pentagon , and I have asked for records from the Office of Net Assessment relating to some of its other work as well . To date , they still have not been able to provide all of the records that they ought to provide to the Congress of the United States , under our constitutional responsibility , to see that money is faithfully spent according to congressional intent and that the laws are faithfully executed . While the Office of Net Assessment was busy wasting taxpayers money and not responding to congressional requests , China built its hypersonic missile program . Are we on top of that program ? It has got something to do with our enemys capability . As a result of all of these failures , then , like I told you , I introduced my amendment to the defense bill on November 4 . The amendment would require the Government Accountability Office to determine how much taxpayer money this unit actually uses for net assessment -- the reason they were set up . Are they doing their job ? Are they following the law ? Are they spending the taxpayers money responsibly ? I think I have shown , in some instances , where they have not . The amendment would filter out taxpayer-funded research that has nothing to do with net assessment . In other words , the Office of Net Assessment ought to be doing net assessment , and that deals with the capability of the U.S. Government to do the No . 1 responsibility of the Federal Government : the national defense of the American people . The second responsibility of this Agency is to determine the capability of our enemies to do damage to us . In other words , it is time that we find out how much money the Office of Net Assessment needs to actually do its job instead of acting like a slush fund for irrelevant or political research projects . Of course , if this happens and the taxpayers money is spent properly , this , in turn , will save the taxpayers , potentially , millions of dollars a year . I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment . I yield the floor .'\n",

These amendments would help us understand the factors that influence women servicemembers to stay in or leave the military as well as to take action to improve mental health outcomes for pregnant veterans . Unfortunately , pregnant veterans have been found to be disproportionately impacted by mental health disorders and must be given adequate support to prevent childbirth complications . This language would encourage the VA to support the use of doulas for expectant mothers and increase access for doulas for pregnant veterans . This is a time we must come together in our support of the growing number of women in the military .'\n",
    "raw035 = 'Tom COTTON . Madam President , just 4 short months ago , hopes were running high in the Middle East . ISIS was wiped off the map , the Iranian regime and its terrorist proxies were in retreat , and Israel was forging historic peace deals with its neighbors . All along the way , the United States was instrumental in this progress . But in just a few months , the Biden administration has dashed those hopes with its policy of weakness and appeasement . The forces of terror are again on the march . Pillars of smoke and fire are rising from Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem . The assault on Israel by terrorist groups like Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad is the latest and most concrete evidence yet that the Middle East is spiraling toward chaos . But instead of standing firm with Israel , the Biden administration  policy of endless accommodation is fanning the flames of conflict . The President should show strength . Instead , he is broadcasting indecision and weakness . Our greatest ally in the Middle East is under attack . Yet the Democratic Party refuses to say : We stand with Israel . The night sky over the Jewish State blazes with the starbursts of intercepted rockets , and the Biden administration only offers muted calls for restraint . Where are the righteous denunciations of the terrorists responsible for these repeated , premeditated , and unprovoked attacks ? Where are the statements of solidarity with Israel ? Please . From this administration and from this Democratic Party , we cannot even get the President  spokeswoman to say that the United States would help resupply munitions for Iron Dome , Israel  lifesaving missile defense system . So this afternoon , let me provide a little clarity that the President and his party appear incapable or unwilling to articulate . The fault for the death and destruction in the streets of Tel Aviv , Jerusalem , Gaza , and the West Bank lies not with the Israeli Government , much less with the Israeli people . The belligerents in this conflict are not morally equivalent , the way it is often presented in supposedly enlightened circles . Put simply , there are good guys , and there are bad guys . Israel seeks peace . Terror groups seek death and destruction . Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad are not legitimate state actors . They do not speak for the Palestinian people and do not truly care about them . These groups are terrorist organizations run by evil men who commit evil acts in pursuit of the evil dreams of an evil ideology . They purposely fire waves of unguided rockets at civilian targets , while they protect themselves from reprisal using babies , hospitals , schools , and dupes in the media as shields -- what cowards , attacking innocent civilians while they hide behind women . [ [ Page S2536 ] ] Of course , Hamas and the Islamic Jihad do not act alone . The Palestinian Authority supports , encourages , and funds terrorism in the form of so-called martyr payments -- pensions paid to terrorists who attack Jews . The PA perpetuates cycles of violence by refusing to acknowledge the existence of Israel , teaching anti-Semitism in its schools and leaving its people to wallow in poverty as wards of the international community . And we all know who funds and arms Palestinian terrorist organizations , the world  foremost supporter of terrorism , the Islamic Republic of Iran . For decades , Iran  theocrats have staged demonstrations where their fanatical supporters scream : `` Death to America '' and `` Death to Israel . '' The assault on Israel today shows that those chants are not idle threats . Iran  ayatollahs are deadly serious about wiping the Jewish State off the map . That is why Iran arms Palestinian terrorists with some of its most lethal weapons . Hamas  arsenal of 10,000 rockets might as well have `` Made in Iran '' stamped on the side . Those are the villains of this conflict , but let  not forget the heroes . Standing courageously against this organized onslaught is the State of Israel , our closest ally in the region . Over the past week , terrorists have fired approximately 3,000 missiles and rockets into Israel . In response , Israel has defended itself with technological miracles like Iron Dome . It has carried out precision airstrikes against military targets , and , as always , Israel has gone to extraordinary lengths to minimize civilian casualties , despite the terrorists best efforts to maximize and then publicize any carnage . While Hamas and the Islamic Jihad fire indiscriminately from Palestinian schools , office buildings , and apartments , Israel responds by hitting those launch sites , but only after -- only after -- they warn civilians , allowing them to evacuate first . Regrettably , these warnings also allow terrorists to escape , but Israel bears that cost because it values innocent life , unlike its terrorist enemies . You may have heard of one recent example Last week , Israel carried out an airstrike against a building used by Hamas intelligence personnel , a building that also housed the Associated Press . An hour before the airstrike , the Israeli military called the AP and other civilians in that complex and warned them to depart . This precaution , once again , allowed Hamas terrorists to escape but also allowed reporters and other civilians to vacate the premises before the airstrike occurred . As a result , no civilians died , and Hamas lost a terrorist haven . Now , in any other country and with any other military -- except America  , I have to add -- one would hear praise for that military  restraint and commitment to the laws of order . But because this military is the IDF and the country is Israel and the people are the Jews , they are widely condemned around the world and on the left in America . If you cut through the hysterics and the hyperbole , you can see the truth clearly : One side seeks to maximize carnage and the other seeks to minimize civilian casualties . Besides , I must observe , why is the Associated Press sharing a building with Hamas ? Surely , these intrepid reporters knew who their neighbors were . Did they knowingly allow themselves to be used as human shields by a U.S.-designated terrorist organization ? Did AP pull its punches and decline to report for years on Hamas  misdeeds ? I submit that the AP has some uncomfortable questions to answer . Yet the AP and its fellow journalists are in high dudgeon about Israel  wholly appropriate airstrike . Leave it to whiny reporters to make themselves the story and the victim when terrorists are shooting missiles at innocent civilians . In any event , the moral standing of the competing forces in this conflict is simple and clear . Our greatest ally and the only democracy in the region against an Islamist theocracy and its terrorist partners -- most Americans know which side they are on . I speak for them when I say that we stand with Israel . Unfortunately , too many elected Democrats have taken a different stand . Members of the so-called `` Squad '' in the House of Representatives have called Israel an apartheid state and accused it of war crimes . Remember , these are not obscure backbenchers . Many Democrats herald these Representatives as the future of their party . Meanwhile , 27 Democratic Senators have called for an immediate cease- fire to the conflict . Even the Democratic floor leader , who has long styled himself as Israel  great defender , has joined this moral equivalence , calling for immediate cease-fire . Hear me clearly . The handwringing calls for a cease-fire are tantamount to Hamas propaganda . Both sides are not the same in this conflict , no matter what the Democrats naively imply . If Hamas puts down its weapons , there would be peace . If Israel puts down its weapons , there would be no Israel . Thankfully , Israel  leadership is resolute , united , and committed to victory . The United States should respond to this terrorist onslaught with equal resolve . That means we should give Israel the time , space , and resources to destroy Hamas  war machine and protect its own people . We should also ensure that Israel has the military hardware to weather this crisis . Hamas may have as many as 10,000 missiles , rockets , and mortars in reserve . Meanwhile , Hezbollah lurks to the north with many times that arsenal . We should , therefore , endeavor to ensure that Israel has more interceptors for Iron Dome than Hamas has rockets to kill Israelis . Moreover , we ought to cut off aid to the Palestinian Authority until we can be absolutely sure that not a dime of taxpayer money is being used to buy and build rockets or pay pensions for murderous terrorists . And , finally , the Biden administration ought to immediately end its misguided flirtation with the theocrats in Iran by recalling its chief negotiator and appeaser , Rob Malley , from negotiations in Vienna . If the Biden administration reenters the failed Iran nuclear agreement and grants sanctions relief to the regime in Tehran , in very short order that appeasement payoff will be converted into rockets aimed at Israel , as well as at American troops throughout the region . While Israel is under attack , we have heard plenty of talk and mealymouthed statements from politicians . But in this moment of crisis , Israel needs more than words . Israel needs and deserves our full support to defend itself and its people and to achieve a just and lasting peace . I yield the floor . I suggest the absence of a quorum .'\n",
    "raw036 = 'Mitch McCONNELL . Now , Mr. President , on an entirely different matter , yesterday , the Senate took a step toward considering wide-ranging legislation that would touch on multiple parts of the U.S. economy in the name of increasing innovation and competitiveness . A secure , productive , and innovative America that can outcompete China is something that all 100 Senators want . Of course , in a place like the Senate , you are guaranteed to find a wide variety of different ideas about the best ways to encourage that . A number of our colleagues have assembled a proposal that touches on a long list of subjects -- everything from funding universities , to regional economic development , to Indo-Pacific geopolitics , to artificial intelligence , to cyber security , and beyond . Legislation this broad needs a thorough , robust , and bipartisan floor process , including a healthy series of amendment votes . As one of my Republican colleagues -- the ranking member on the Commerce Committee -- explained , as he supported moving the legislation out of committee , the current draft is `` not ready for prime time '' yet and deserves a robust process here on the floor . I understand this bill has come to the floor with a bipartisan understanding and the Democratic leader  assurances that there will not be an effort to close debate on amendments prematurely . So I look forward to the Senate  considering these important issues , and I hope all of this interest in our competition with China will lead our Democratic friends to rethink President Biden  intention to cut our defense spending after inflation . The single best thing we can do to stay competitive with China is to give our Armed Forces the resources they need to stay competitive with China . '\n",
    "raw037 = 'Ben SASSE . Mr. President , Winston Churchill is often credited with the apocryphal quote that `` we sleep soundly in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm .  This is still true , but the 21st century has gotten more complicated . We live in an era of hybrid wars . There are fewer D-days on enemy beaches and more zero-day exploits in enemy servers . Americans sleep soundly at night because , in addition to these rough men at the ready , brilliant men and women work around the clock to develop national security technology that defends our interests and undermines our enemies . DARPA -- the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency -- is on the frontlines of that work . They are racing against our adversaries . Our technology struggle against the Chinese Communist Party is the defining national security challenge of our time . Chairman Xi and his techno-authoritarian regime are fundamentally opposed to not just American values but American interests all around the globe . Our citizens watching this Chamber on most days might think that most of their political leaders are content to ignore this reality , but I assure my colleagues in this Chamber that the CCP is not asleep at the switch . Beijing is aggressively investing in machine learning and artificial intelligence and in quantum computing . They are hacking and stealing America  research and America  intellectual property . The Chinese Communist Party is on a mission , and they make no attempt to hide it . They want to become the world  preeminent superpower , and they think that by claiming first-mover advantage in the cyber domain , they can achieve this . We cannot let that happen . My amendment to today  legislation is simple : It doubles DARPA  budget , $ 3.5 billion to $ 7 billion a year for each of the next 5 years . The work of the National Science Foundation is important as well , and I support that work . I support that research . But the NSF  research is broad . DARPA  research is directly applied to our most critical national security challenges . Cutting-edge , classified tech development is in DARPA  DNA . When we talk about identifying and disrupting the CCP  AI-enabled cyber and information campaigns , we want DARPA to be leading that work . When we talk about developing new technological tools to push back on the CCP  hybrid warfare , we want DARPA to be leading that work . If we want American democracy to outlast Chinese techno- authoritarianism , we can make this investment . Doubling DARPA  budget is a cost-effective investment that bolsters that work , and it bolsters the work of the Endless Frontier legislation we are debating this week , and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this amendment .

And as the ranking member of the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee , I want to thank our subcommittee chairman , Donald Norcross , for his collaborative , bipartisan efforts . I am pleased the committee approved a bipartisan amendment in markup to increase the top line by $ 23.9 billion . This increase is needed to continue the progress we have made in rebuilding readiness and will facilitate modernization programs necessary to prepare our military forces to compete with , deter , and win against peer challengers and adversaries . Under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee, this bill continues critical oversight of the strike-fighter force structure and inventory management of the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps , setting better conditions for ensuring the right mix of fourth and fifth generation fighters , and managing operational risk . Specifically , this legislation authorizes funding for 80 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters , 24 F-15EX aircraft , and 12 F/A-18 Super Hornets . The legislation also reverses several proposed cuts , including procurement for small caliber ammunition accounts of the Army. It also facilitates stronger oversight to ensure current ISR and counter UAS capabilities and capacity are maintained and prioritized to mitigate near-term operational risk and prevent future capability gaps . Outside the jurisdiction of the subcommitte, I am pleased that this bill includes several provisions regarding the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan , including my provision requiring an accounting of the decision to leave Bagram Air Base . I am also pleased this legislation includes two of my bills , the CADET Act and the Connecting the Community to End Military Suicide Act . I do have concerns with several provisions in the underlying bill , including the selective service , and I am hopeful we can work in a bipartisan manner to address those . I encourage support .

We also do this by empowering American companies and the industrial base that provides goods and services to the DOD . The hardworking Mississippians who work for companies like Airbus , Huntington Ingalls , Winchester , General Dynamics , Stark Aerospace , SpaceX and General Atomics keep our Nation safe and deserve the support of our Congress . This bill includes a Republican amendment boosting the defense top line by nearly $ 25 billion and reverses the administration s reckless cuts to our national security , restoring funding for shipbuilding , procurement , missile defense , and modernization . This bill will also fund the unfunded top priorities of our military that the White House failed to support . Once passed , this bill further bolsters our military s ability to maintain its dominance in every domain , and ensures military leaders have the resources to take care of servicemembers and military families . Additionally , this year s NDAA will begin the process of holding the White House accountable for the mistakes in Afghanistan . For months , we have asked for more detail on the so-called over-the-horizon strategy to conduct counterterrorism . We received scant details ahead of the withdrawal , and America deserves answers to why the withdrawal was so unorganized in planning and execution run by the Commander in Chief and the State Department . The lack of planning leading up to the withdrawal and the continued inability to maintain control on the ground by this administration is staggering . The Armed Services Committee , particularly this Subcommittee on Intelligence and Special Operations , will not allow these weaknesses of the administration to continue to place our citizens , allies , partners , and overall national security at risk . This year s bill calls for the administration to provide a plan to get the rest of the American citizens out . Finally , I would be remiss without asking about my teammates , which is Tony Starks , Colin Hawkins , and Rodney Hall , professional staffer , Patrick Nevins , and my battle buddy in all of this , Ranking Member Gallego . I ask my colleagues to support this bill .'\n",
    "raw041 = 'James Edward BANKS . Madam Speaker , I rise today in support of H.R . 4350 , the FY22 NDAA . Our current and future warfighting capabilities are contingent on modernizing the Department of Defense and recruiting and equipping the military with the most effective , secure , and cutting-edge technologies . Our adversaries are focused on our defeat on and off the battlefield . They are pouring money into research and development of emerging technologies , recruiting top scientists , and stealing intellectual property to gain a tactical edge . This NDAA pushes the Department to accelerate innovation and strengthen its cyber posture , a critical capability if we want to maintain superiority in the era of great power competition . I want to thank Ranking Member Rogers , who , because of his leadership , fought for and gained nearly $ 25 billion in this bill to boost emerging technologies and cybersecurity programs during the markup . [ [ Page H4804 ] ] These funds enhance areas like hypersonics , AI , and quantum computing and make a historical investment to renovate the Department s labs and testing facilities . As ranking member , I am also proud of the work that we have done on our subcommittee , the Cyber , Innovative Technologies , and Information Systems Subcommittee led by Chairman Langevin , in this inaugural NDAA for this subcommittee . We included provisions to transition innovative technologies quickly into the hands of the warfighter , to help companies bridge the valley of death , and to implement many of the recommendations of the National Security Commission on AI . In the past year , we have seen landmark cyberattacks , a trend which is likely to continue , and we must be prepared . We bolster and strengthen the Department s information security systems and improve sharing and analysis of cyber threat information across the Department . Madam Speaker , I strongly support this bill and encourage my colleagues to do the same . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time .'\n",
    "raw042 = 'Donald John BACON . Madam Speaker , I rise in support of the National Defense Authorization Act . I commend the outstanding leadership of Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Mike Rogers for delivering strong , bipartisan legislation that provides for our common defense . While I am personally grateful that this bill includes dozens of my provisions , I am most proud of the fact that the bill sends a clear bipartisan message that we must keep our national defense spending level with inflation and reject the temptation to cut defense when our allies and enemies are questioning American leadership . As the White House  own strategic guidance states , America must confront global challenges from a position of strength , not weakness . I am also proud that this bill includes multiple provisions ensuring oversight and accountability for the recent debacle in Afghanistan . As we stand here today , this crisis is ongoing , with hundreds of U.S. citizens and residents , including my constituents from Nebraska , who are still trapped in Afghanistan . Oversight of the way the botched withdrawal was handled is not and should not be a partisan issue , and I am proud that the House has not backed away from its responsibilities . Madam Speaker , I urge support of this bill . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah ( Mr. Moore ) , one of our outstanding freshman Members . Mr. MOORE of Utah . Madam Speaker , I rise in opposition to the MILCON amendment . This is actually something that we agree on , that most people would agree on . We have apartments that our airmen are staying in at Hill Air Force Base where literally they have to section off corners of the sidewalk because bricks are falling off the building . This is not up to the standard of what we would like to provide for our men and women who are willing to go and serve in this capacity . This is something that we all agree on . The reason I stand to oppose the amendment is because it just increases the costs for a MILCON budget that is already laden with a lot of work with very little money . This will require a sort of preference for local hiring , which is a good thing , but it also adds in a lot of bureaucracy with respect to licensing and making sure that every single military construction contractor has all the little prerequisites for each State . This is something that we have rejected in the past , and it ultimately just adds a lot of cost . It is ironic that both the Trump and Biden administrations disagree with this . Chambers of commerce actually oppose this . A few others that are noteworthy are the defense industry of America , Association of General Contractors , and American Council of Engineering Companies . They all oppose this effort . Again , this impacts the skilled workforce . Every single construction company that I talk to right now says they ca not even hire in their local area . So to require companies to go to each area where there is a base and take away some of their skilled workforce to then go hire a workforce that is in that particular city , it adds an extra burden .'\n",
    "raw043 = 'Stephanie BICE of Oklahoma . Madam Speaker , I rise today in support of H.R . 4350 , this year s National Defense Authorization Act . As a member of the Armed Services Committee , I was honored to have a seat at the table in crafting this legislation , and I am pleased to have been successful in having a good number of my priorities for Oklahoma s Fifth District included in this bill . As a new member of the House Armed Services Committee , I was deeply concerned when President Biden proposed earlier this year to essentially cut our defense budget below the rate of inflation at a time when we are facing serious threats from around the world . I am thankful for the leadership of Ranking Member Rogers in securing a bipartisan deal in this bill to provide the additional resources needed to meet our Nation s defense needs . This bill makes important investments to protect our Nation from dangerous adversaries like Russia and China . I also fought to include several items in the bill we are considering today , including a measure I co-led with Congresswoman Gonzalez-Colon to require DOD to survey access to mental health and suicide prevention services within the military healthcare system , as well as a modified version of my bill to protect servicemembers and their families with disabilities from being charged out-of-pocket expenses for needed ADA upgrades to their on-base housing unit . Lastly , I successfully advanced amendments to require the DOD to analyze the security threats resulting from the Taliban s release of thousands of prisoners from Bagram Air Base and an amendment to increase resources for the Army National Guard to assist CBP with security operations on the southern border in light of the growing threats emanating from Afghanistan and elsewhere . Bottom line , this bill strengthens our Nation s defenses , supports our brave servicemembers , and sustains important defense programs across the Nation and in my home State of Oklahoma . Madam Speaker , certainly there may be provisions of this bill that not everyone agrees with , but I urge my colleagues to support the bill .'\n",
    "raw044 = 'Scott DesJARLAIS . Madam Speaker , I rise today to express my support for the National Defense Authorization Act . The bill before us today represents a much-improved effort over the Biden-Harris administration  proposed budget . There is no more important job than providing for the defense of our Nation . The specter of threats from an aggressive China , a revitalized Russia , and radical Islamic terrorist states demand that we maintain a strong national defense readiness and posture . This NDAA will give a much-deserved and needed pay raise and expanded benefits to members of our armed services . We are making investments to ensure our military is the best equipped and trained in the world , with a focus on American jobs and our domestic manufacturing base . We are also investing in important new technologies like quantum computing , hypersonic weapons , and autonomous systems . I am proud to say that Arnold Air Force Base , the University of Tennessee Space Institute , Vanderbilt University , Fort Campbell Army Base , Oak [ [ Page H4805 ] ] Ridge National Laboratory , and other Tennessee stakeholders will receive the funds that they need to carry out vital operations for our United States military . That said , the bill is not perfect . I am disappointed in House Democrats for preventing my `` no first use '' amendment from coming to the floor for a vote . In hearings before our committee , our military leadership emphasized that a `` no first use '' policy is a limiting strategic mistake , and a number of our allies have expressed these concerns directly to me as well . We should never tip our strategic plans to our adversaries . It is also disappointing that those on the other side of the aisle have taken a bill intended to improve our military and muddled it with attempts to score political points . { time } 2200 While I do not support these poison pills , I am hopeful that my colleagues will remove them during conference before its final passage . That said , we must move forward with this legislation . I support making it stronger , avoiding nongermane political issues , and getting it signed into law for our brave men and women in uniform .'\n",
    "raw045 = 'Matt GAETZ . Madam Speaker , on behalf of the tens of thousands of military families in northwest Florida , I rise in strong support of this year s National Defense Authorization Act . This bill does right by military families by ensuring that we upgrade training systems , increasing their proficiency , and ensuring that our servicemembers are safe when they go down range . The bill enhances platforms and equipment survivability to ensure that our troops are in the best possible position to prevail in every battle and vanquish any foe . The 2.7 percent pay raise is vastly needed and is a small debt of gratitude for the elite level of patriotism that our servicemembers show each and every day . The bill does right by the mission by investing in research , development test and evaluation by increasing our investment in cyber , by ensuring that we have a military construction budget that allows us to meet ambitious goals to be able to grow strategic mission in particular areas , and our investment in the space force ensures that America will always hold the high ground . With this legislation , America wins the future by focusing on great power competition , and by ensuring that we win that great power competition with great focus and great competence . I thank the bipartisan leadership of the committee , and I would note that that bipartisan leadership has been necessary because President Biden s initial budget did not meet the needs of the country to the same degree that this House will . It is a testament to Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers that brighter minds have prevailed . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I continue to reserve the balance of my time . '\n"

    "raw39 = 'Stephanie MURPHY . Madam President , I come to the floor this afternoon to talk about two issues of vital importance to the United States and the world . First , I want to say a few words about the current violence paralyzing Israel and the Palestinian territories , but then I want to spend the bulk of my remarks on the future of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East . First , here in America , our hearts are breaking for Israelis and Palestinians . [ [ Page S2539 ] ] The images are just bone-chilling -- rockets and interceptors streaking across the night sky , parents huddled with their children as air raid sirens ring out , tragic images of innocent Israeli and Palestinian civilians , including children , injured or killed in the blasts . For many Americans who are turning on the news this week , it might appear that the events of the last few days erupted almost overnight . While tensions are now reaching a fevered and deadly pitch , this cataclysm has been long in the making and no party , including the United States of America , has completely clean hands . Zero-sum politics have driven both the decision making of the Netanyahu government and Palestinian leadership , to the extent that there is such a thing as Palestinian leadership . Those decisions have led us to this crisis . Over and over , Prime Minister Netanyahu has pushed Israeli settlements further into territory historically considered reserved for a future Palestinian State . The Israeli Government , increasingly reliant on rightwing , zero-sum political constituencies for its survival , also stepped up campaigns to remove Palestinians from areas in East Jerusalem as a means to undermine the Palestinian claim to that section of the ancient city as the capital of a future state . The spark that lit the match of the existing conflagration was the Israeli effort to remove Palestinian families from their homes in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah and replace them with Israeli settlers . In February , the Israeli court ordered Palestinian families in that neighborhood to vacate their homes by May 2 or they would be forcibly removed . Protests began , spread to other cities in Israel with large Arab populations , while the Palestinian families awaited a final ruling from the Israeli Supreme Court . As these protests spread and grew in size , Israeli police adopted some tactics that we have seen on display here in the United States -- an overly securitized approach that only escalated rather than defused the tension . Those crackdowns led to more protests and more clashes and a cycle that continued and continued . Then Israeli security forces stormed Islam  third holiest site in Jerusalem during Ramadan prayers . Now , the Israelis contend that they were responding to a rock thrown from Palestinians inside . The Palestinians argue it was the other way around . But whatever happened , at the end of that night , more than 330 Palestinians and 22 Israelis had been injured . The story of the Palestinians conduct over the last decade is just as important in understanding the roots of the existing crisis . Fatah , the main political party representing Palestinians , has failed the people it represents . Ripe with internal conflict and corruption , Fatah lost its mandate to govern Gaza in 2006 , when Hamas , an internationally recognized terrorist organization , beat Fatah in parliamentary elections there that year . Hamas refuses to recognize the right of Israel to exist and advocates for the armed rebellion of Palestinians against Israel . Fatah , under pressure from Hamas to take more extreme positions , spent most of the last decade refusing any and all chance to negotiate with the Israelis , preferring to sit on the sidelines and nurture grievances . They were unable to deliver any real economic benefit to the people under their charge in the West Bank , and the resulting desperation of Palestinians fed this grievance culture even more . In response to those events I mentioned at Al Aqsa , Hamas and its allies in Gaza started firing rockets into southern and central Israel . Since that day , thousands of rockets have landed inside Israel . These rocket attacks were then responded to by an Israeli Government that has begun its own assault inside Gaza , and as we sit here today , hundreds of Palestinians inside Gaza , including children , have been killed . Although there have not been as many casualties in Israel because of the defense-security relationship with the United States , Israelis have been killed as well . The Israelis were wrong to pursue settlements and evictions as a deliberate means to undermine a future Palestinian state . These policies might have helped hold together Netanyahu  political coalition , but they helped to feed a sense of hopelessness amongst Palestinians and their future . The Palestinian leadership was wrong to perpetuate an anti-Israeli , anti-Semitic narrative as a foundation of their hold on power . They were wrong to choose grievance over diplomacy . But the United States , over the last 4 years , played a role too . President Trump rejected America  historic role as a broker for peace and reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians . He chose a side unconditionally , and his alliance with Netanyahu and his rejection of a Palestinian state drove the two parties further apart and turned the temperature up . Trump pursued a path to intentionally create division rather than healing . Those 4 years of America  absence from its traditional post of mediator is also a big reason we are here today . There is going to be time to talk about the big picture -- to talk about what went wrong and how American policy needs to change toward Israel and the West Bank and Gaza -- but right now , our focus needs to be laser-like on deescalation , on a cease-fire . Hamas must stop its rocket attacks . They are war crimes . They are indiscriminate . They do nothing to help the Palestinians in East Jerusalem or anywhere else . Israel needs to stand down its military campaign as well . They have to take off the table a ground invasion of Gaza . Israel possesses a disproportionate military power . That is why , during the 2014 invasion of Gaza , 2,000 Palestinians died compared with fewer than 100 Israelis . But when children die in Gaza , it does nothing to secure Israel . In fact , it does the opposite . It just provides further fuel to this furnace of grievances . So I am glad that the administration is sending Deputy Assistant Secretary Amr to the region , that he is there . It is critical that we also get a formal U.S . Ambassador to Israel in place as quickly as possible . But the United States needs to be pressing for a cease-fire . The United States cannot afford to simply allow for this escalation to continue . That is not in Israel  best interest , and that is not in America  best interest . My hope is , in the conversations that are happening today between the Biden administration and the Netanyahu government , that they are talking about the terms to bring this violence to an end . Now , as to the second topic , I recently spent 5 days in the Middle East last week . I came back just before this recent spate of violence began in Gaza and Israel . During the 5 days I was in the Middle East , I crossed paths with a bunch of Biden officials who were making stops throughout the region , and I can report that , in setting aside the conflict in Israel -- something that is pretty hard to do right now -- there is some real positive news to bring back from the Gulf . The 4-year-long rift between Qatar and its Gulf neighbors is healing . There is now a new diplomatic energy behind cease-fire talks in Yemen , and the Saudis and the Iranians are in direct talks for the first time in years . All of this -- I was repeatedly told by leaders in the Middle East -- is happening because President Biden has made clear that deescalation is going to be rewarded and supported by the United States -- a stark departure from the Trump administration . Now , this is good news , but the bad news quickly follows , and it is this : If the United States does not reenter the Iran nuclear agreement , all of this nascent progress is going to be at risk . Joe Biden ran on a promise to reenter the Iran nuclear agreement . He made this commitment because he knew that this agreement was critical to American security . With Iran  nuclear program curtailed and inspectors allowed to comb every inch of the country to look for signs of a secret enrichment program , the world could breathe a sigh of relief in knowing that , for all of Iran  other malevolent behaviors and policies , at least we knew that they were not developing a nuclear weapon . The achievement of the deal also brought together a set of really unlikely bedfellows -- the United States and Europe but also Russia and China . On Iran policy , with this coalition of regular adversaries , it was intact at the end of the Obama administration . It was ready to be picked up by President Trump to confront Iran  ballistic [ [ Page S2540 ] ] missile program or their support for regional proxy forces like Hezbollah , but Trump went in a different direction . Instead of building on the Iran deal , he decided to put to test the theory of its opponents . That theory is this : that if the United States imposed unilateral , crippling sanctions on Iran , leaders in Tehran would limp to the negotiating table , cowed and willing to put all of the issues -- nuclear enrichment , missiles , human rights , proxy support -- up for discussion . That is what Obama  critics said he should have done , and those critics cheered when Trump took their advice . What happened , of course , was a policy cataclysm . Trump imposed the sanctions , and our partners , instead of following America  lead , effectively took the Iranian side , even helping Iran work around our sanctions . Making matters worse , when Trump sent word to the Iranians of our 12 demands , they refused to talk . Instead , they did the opposite . They ratcheted up their bad behavior . They sent more support to the Houthis in Yemen . They restarted dormant parts of their nuclear program , reducing their breakout time to a weapon from just over a year to just under 3 months , and they resumed attacks on American forces in the region , both directly and through proxies . Here is a pretty simple way to take a look at the success of the maximum pressure campaign . One element of the Iran nuclear deal was a commitment by Iran to reduce their enriched uranium stockpile . You can see , in the years leading up to the deal , there is a dramatic escalation in the amount of enriched uranium the Iranians are holding . Then immediately upon the deal  being reached , it plummets . Yet here is the bad news : As soon as the maximum pressure campaign is unveiled by President Trump , those numbers start to creep back up again . One chart explains to you the effect of Trump  maximum pressure campaign . It was a spectacular failure and definitive proof that the alternative approach , cheered by the Iran deal  opponents -- keep the sanctions in place until Iran totally capitulates -- was a fantasy . Instead , the situation has empowered the more hardline wing of an already hardline regime who is prepared to perpetually operate a resistance economy and blame the United States for the nation  suffering . Yet now those same critics of the nuclear agreement are back , and incredibly , despit the writing inked on the wall during the past 4 years , their argument has not changed a bit . Just keep doing what Trump did , and this time it will work , they say . They suggest that getting back into the nuclear deal , as Biden pledged during the campaign , is not enough . They want a new deal that includes a resolution to all of Iran  bad acts , but unless we are prepared to invade Iran and demand unconditional surrender -- news flash : We are not -- then that comprehensive , soup-to-nuts deal is a neoconservative fantasy . It does not exist in real life . In real life , the achievable result is a restart of the nuclear agreement . The good news is that this result in 2021 might have an even greater peace dividend than when it was executed the first time in 2015 . This brings me back to my trip to the region . I heard this story , while I was there , of how quickly talks on healing the Gulf Cooperation Council rift matured as soon as Biden won the election . Countries that were at one another  throats throughout the Trump administration were suddenly coming to terms with one another . While conflict and bullying and score-settling -- Trump  calling cards -- were rewarded during his term , countries quickly realized that diplomacy and deescalation would most quickly win favor with President Biden . In Oman , I heard how the Saudis were suddenly much more willing to make additional concessions in Yemen and how the Houthis were now more likely to trust the United States as an interlocutor . In Jordan , the King talked to us about how an Iraqi Government was now more welcoming than ever of help from places other than Iran , and he spoke of Jordan  new overtures to a Baghdad Government in its looking for a more diverse set of allies . And everyone in the region , at every stop , buzzed about these talks , these dialogues , between the Saudis and the Iranians . Reports suggest that these two countries wanted to talk during the Trump administration but were discouraged from doing so . This momentum toward peace is encouraging , but it is so fragile , and one major setback , one major , unexpected diplomatic hiccup , could turn all of this progress around . I worry that this hiccup could be the failure of America and Iran to get back into the nuclear agreement . If the talks fail and the Biden administration is forced to implement Trump  Iran policy for the next 4 years , complete with these unilateral crippling sanctions , it is easy to see how all of this progress in the Gulf could disintegrate . The so-called Iranian moderates would head back to Tehran with no deal and be defeated in the upcoming national elections . A harder line government , much less prone to diplomacy , would choose to scuttle peace talks in Yemen , end the outreach to the Saudis , and work like mad to make sure that their proxies in Iraq take power in the upcoming parliamentary elections . This could convince the Saudis to double down militarily in Yemen and open up new fissures in the Gulf . Listen , maybe I am wrong . Maybe this is an overly apocalyptic vision of what would occur if the nuclear negotiations go south , but I fear that it is more accurate than fantastical that the stakes might be that high , which brings me , finally , to our negotiations in Vienna . If the consequences of success are so promising and if the ramifications of failure are so dire , then what has to happen to guarantee a good outcome ? And I will end here . First , the structure of the talks is deeply problematic , and that is the Iranians fault . They are insisting on this shuttle diplomacy when we should be talking directly to them . Second , countries in Iran  neighborhood that were hostile or neutral to the talks in 2015 suddenly have their eyes wide open to the benefits of getting back into the deal , so we should make sure that our partners in the Middle East who have the ear of the Iranian Government or the Supreme Leader are applying the appropriate pressure and letting Iran know that their relationships in the region are at risk if Iran fails to get back into the deal . On our side of the ledger , we need to be willing to be creative . Now , of course , any restart of the nuclear agreement is going to require the United States to drop the sanctions Trump applied to Iran  economy -- that had the same impact as the Obama-era nuclear sanctions . Yet here is the point I want to make : What about the other sanctions that Trump layered on top of the economic sanctions ? For example , it should be expected that the Iranians would want us to lift Trump  designation of its primary military force , the IRGC , as a terrorist organization . This was not strictly a nuclear sanction , but it was certainly a key part of Trump  maximum pressure campaign , and it was specifically designed to try to bring Iran back to the negotiating table on a nuclear program . In evaluating the wisdom of peeling back these noneconomic sanctions , it is important to remember that they were all completely feckless . These sanctions had no impact . In fact , their only impact was to worsen Iran  behavior , so lifting them would have no practical negative impact . Just as importantly , lifting this particular designation , the one example I am posing to you today , is a rather technical exercise under the U.S. statute , and it actually does not prevent us from sanctioning the truly bad actors in the Iranian military . For example , our sanctions on some of their most brutal interrogators -- the IRGC  interrogators -- would all stay in place even if we lifted that blanket IRGC designation . This is just one example of a Trump-era sanction whose erasure would have little to no practical impact . There are many more , but I use this example to show how weighing the equities , the benefits , of getting into the deal are going to be far greater than the imaginary benefits of keeping many of Trump  noneconomic sanctions . Now , let me be clear . If the sanctions like this are removed , opponents of the deal are going to cry bloody murder in that they are going to accuse Biden of giving more than Obama gave , but this is the exact trap that Trump was trying to set for his successor . He applied [ [ Page S2541 ] ] sanctions on Iran in connection with the pullout of the nuclear deal , but he called them nonnuclear sanctions , hoping the next President would be caught in this sticky web . President Biden should not be bound by Trump  tortured sanctions logic . But , just as importantly , let me assure you that no matter the particulars or the details of the agreement to restart the nuclear deal , the deal critics are going to oppose it , no matter what . They opposed it in 2015 . They are going to oppose it again . What we should really be worried about is Trump  Iran policy becoming , by accident , permanent , and this is what is likely to occur if the Vienna talks fail . Iran will continue to speed up its nuclear research program , the maximum pressure will continue , and a chill will be delivered to the deescalation momentum in the region . But on the other hand , reentering the deal , while effectively already priced into a Biden electoral victory , will be seen as a diplomatic victory , at a perfect time to score a win for diplomacy , and the Middle East countries who have found new affection for a U.S.-Iran agreement will exhale . Now , I am not naive . I understand the Middle East has still dozens of intractable crises , and the events of the last few days in Israel and Gaza are a reminder of the grave challenges that are still there . But the overall mood of deescalation in and around the Gulf is real , and it is much better than the old incentive structure for escalation . So I see these roots of positive change slowly , quietly growing , and , right now , the best way for the United States to nurture those grass shoots is to restart the Iran nuclear agreement . I yield the floor . '"

    "rawfp = 'Frank PALLONE . Mr. Speaker , I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill ( H.R . 3723 ) to direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission to establish a pilot program to explore the use of artificial intelligence in support of the mission of the Commission and direct the Secretary of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission to study and report on the use of blockchain technology and digital tokens , respectively . Mr. Speaker , I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R . 3723 . The SPEAKER pro tempore . Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey ? There was no objection . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . Mr. Speaker , I rise to speak in support of H.R . 3723 , the Consumer Safety Technology Act , and I want to begin by thanking Representatives McNerney and Burgess for their leadership on this bill , which they reintroduced this Congress . This legislation will help modernize our consumer protection agencies and encourage the use of advanced technologies , like artificial intelligence and blockchain in support of product safety and consumer protection . These technologies can help the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission improve their operations and more effectively carry out their mission . Technological advances and globalization have greatly expanded the range of consumer products on the market . And as consumers shop online , more and more of these products are being shipped directly to homes . Artificial intelligence could help the CPSC oversee the increasingly complex range of products under its jurisdiction by helping to identify new injury trends and emerging hazards . AI can also help the CPSC monitor online marketplaces for the illegal sale of recalled products . The persistence of recalled products on online third-party marketplaces is a particularly pernicious problem that puts Americans needlessly at risk . For example , months after the dangerous Fisher-Price Rock ` n Play and other infant inclined sleepers were recalled , a Consumer Reports investigation found that these products were still being sold on sites like Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist , even though they had been linked to dozens of infant fatalities . I am hopeful that artificial intelligence can be harnessed here to help eradicate the illegal sale of recalled products on online marketplaces . The CPSC could also use AI to assess the risks of the growing number of imported consumer products entering our country and being sent directly to consumers . This bill incorporates a bill originally introduced by Representative Soto and Guthrie , the Blockchain Innovation Act , and a bill originally introduced by Representatives Davidson and Soto , the Digital Taxonomy Act . As incorporated in this legislation , these bills will help identify ways blockchain technology can be used to further support consumer protection . It will also make sure that scammers and fraudsters do not get ahead of consumers and law enforcement in the realm of blockchain and digital tokens . Mr. Speaker , finally , I thank Ranking Member Rodgers and Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee Ranking Member Bilirakis for working with us to move this bill ; and as always , to the chairwoman of the subcommittee , the gentlewoman from Illinois ( Ms. Schakowsky ) . Mr. Speaker , I call on my colleagues to support this measure , and I reserve the balance of my time . '\n",

Mr. Speaker , the bipartisan bill directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission to conduct a pilot program to determine how artificial intelligence may be used to advance the product safety mission of the agency. Given the broad jurisdiction of the agency over so many consumer products , efficiently and accurately analyzing data in the marketplace is critical to its effective operation . This bill also includes an important study of how blockchain technology may be used to prevent fraud , increase privacy , and bolster the supply chain of our Nation . This is complementary to the American COMPETE Act that also prioritizes this emerging technology to ensure America leads in the technology and in its development . Furthermore , H.R . 3723 also focuses on digital tokens , which are seeing increased adoption by consumers . The bill targets ways in which we can protect consumers from fraud in the digital token marketplace , a dangerous trend that has recently become more apparent .

    "rawebj = 'Eddie Bernice JOHNSON of Texas . Madam Speaker , today I am pleased to introduce the MSI STEM Achievement Act , which is cosponsored by Mr. Waltz . There is no denying the fact that our success as a nation is closely tied to our capacity to build and sustain a highly-skilled workforce , one that is equipped to take on the pressing challenges of the 21st century and to maintain our leadership in the global economy . Today we are facing grave challenges on many fronts . We are battling a deadly pandemic and a severe economic downturn . We are racing to find sustainable sources of energy and working to mitigate the destructive impacts of climate change . We are fighting against attempts to undermine our democracy by threats both foreign and domestic . Our future prosperity and security are further threatened as competitors like China outpace our investment in scientific research and make rapid advances in critical technologies like advanced communications , quantum computing , and artificial intelligence . To solve these problems , we need a cadre of trained scientists and engineers pushing the boundaries of what we know and what we can achieve . We need computer scientists and economists , biologists and mathematicians , engineers , chemists , and social scientists . So far , we have gotten by with a STEM workforce that does not represent the diversity of our nation . However , that is not a sustainable path forward . Compared with their proportions in the U.S. population , members of racial and ethnic minority groups are significantly underrepresented among STEM degree earners . Less than 25 percent of all bachelors degrees and 9 percent of doctorates in STEM are earned by underrepresented minority students . Despite representing 18 percent of the U.S. population , just 9 percent of bachelors degrees in mathematics and physics are earned by Hispanics . In nearly all STEM fields , the proportion of STEM bachelors degrees earned by Black students has either stagnated or declined since 1996 . Black students earned only 4.8 percent of bachelors degrees in engineering in 1996 . Today , that share is 3.9 percent . In the past two decades , representation of Black students among bachelors degree earners in computer science has fallen from 9.9 percent to 8.7 percent . The challenges we face today demand a dramatic expansion of the STEM workforce , one that is inclusive of talented students of all races , ethnicities , and socioeconomic backgrounds . Fortunately , the minority serving institutions ( MSIs ) of our nation have paved the way with proven approaches for the recruitment and retention of students from marginalized groups in STEM studies . The National Academy of Sciences released a report in 2018 highlighting the outsized contributions made by MSIs , including Historically Black Colleges and Universities ( HBCUs ) , Hispanic Serving Institutions ( HSIs ) , and Tribal Colleges and Universities ( TCUs ) . For instance , HBCUs make up only 3 percent of the colleges and universities of our nation , but graduate 28 percent of African American students earning bachelors degrees in the physical sciences , 26 percent in mathematics , and 25 percent in the biological sciences . However , these institutions have been hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis and more investment and targeted outreach is needed to enable MSIs to fully realize their potential to contribute to the STEM workforce . The bill directs the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) to compile an inventory of competitive funding programs at Federal science agencies targeted to MSIs and recommend steps for agencies to increase the participation and the rate of success of MSIs in these programs . The National Science Foundation is directed to support research to better understand the contributions of MSIs , disseminate and scale up successful models , and identify effective approaches to building the STEM education and research capacity of under-resourced MSIs . The Office of Science and Technology Policy ( OSTP ) is directed to issue policy guidance to Federal science agencies for outreach to raise awareness of funding opportunities and provide guidance on competing for funding . OSTP is also directed to develop a strategic plan to increase the capacity of MSIs to compete for federal research and STEM education funding . Our STEM skills shortage is holding us back . As Chairwoman of the Committee on Science , Space , and Technology I am determined to change that situation . The way I see it , we have two possible futures : one in which we rise to the moment and leverage all of our human capital , and one in which our capacity for innovation and our standing in the world continue to erode . I know which future I want to see happen , and I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation . '\n",
    "rawebj2 = 'Ms. JOHNSON of Texas . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of the amendment . International students and researchers provide enormous benefits for American competitiveness and prosperity . As of 2018 , immigrants founded 50 of the 91 privately held billion-dollar startup tech companies in the United States . A quarter of those founders came to the U.S. as international students . These companies created an average of 1,200 jobs each , and have a collective value of $ 250 billion . International students and researchers bring fresh perspectives , diverse experiences , expertise , energy , and creativity to the U.S. research enterprise . The global competition to attract top science , technology , engineering , mathematics , and medical talent is intensifying . And attracting talent is just half the battle . Restrictive immigration policies and xenophobic rhetoric , restrictions due to the pandemic , and concerted efforts by other countries to attract talent , have given talented international STEM students good reason to consider opportunities outside of the U.S. We must take bold action now to ensure the U.S. can continue to attract and retain global STEM talent . This amendment creates a new pathway to permanent residency for a small number of outstanding students and professionals engaged in critical fields that are vital to achieving the goals of the National Defense Strategy and National Defense Science and Technology Strategy . While modest in scope , the amendment would help advance areas of innovation that are critical to our national security and economic competitiveness . I urge my colleagues to support this amendment . '\n",
    "rawebj3 = 'Ms. JOHNSON of Texas . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . I am very pleased today that we are considering the Department of Energy Science for the Future Act . This well-vetted , bipartisan bill will provide the first ever comprehensive authorization for the Office of Science of the Department of Energy. This office accounts for over half of the nondefense research and development budget of the department and supports a wide range of research facilities and activities that are critical to the U.S. competitiveness and for enabling our clean energy future . The Office of Science is the largest supporter of research in the physical sciences of the Nation, and it is the lead Federal agency supporting scientific research for energy applications . H.R . 3593 authorizes significant , steady , and sustainable growth for the wide- ranging research of the office from climate science to quantum science , and everything in between . The bill also ensures the construction projects of the office and upgrades to its world-class scientific user facility have the resources they need to be completed on time and on budget . H.R . 3593 is a substantial effort in the fight against climate change . The bill authorizes research to advance the next generation of clean energy technologies to help us reach our shared goals of developing energy that is clean , sustainable , reliable , and affordable . In carrying out these activities , this bill also directs the office to support the development of a skilled , diverse , and inclusive workforce for clean energy researchers , scientists , and professionals . That is why the bill has been endorsed by stakeholders in the business community , like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ; the academic community , like the Association of American Universities ; major scientific associations , like the American Physical and Chemical Societies ; and significant environmental organizations like the Environmental Defense Fund . This bill is another strong example of the collaborative bipartisan approach that our committee has taken . The collaborative approach of Ranking Member Lucas has been crucial in getting us to where we are today . Before I yield back , I would like to recognize the Committee on Science , Space , and Technology staff who worked on this bill , and in some cases for several years now : Adam Rosenberg , Alyse Huffman , Sangina Wright , and Bill Kallen . I also recognize the efforts of the staff of Ranking Member Lucas in helping us to get where we are today , including Hillary OBrien , Jenn Wickre , and Daniel Dziadon . I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill to dramatically improve the competitiveness of the Nation and help lead us all to a brighter future .

    "rawfl = 'Frank LUCAS . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . I rise in support of H.R . 3593 , the Department of Energy Science for the Future Act . This legislation , along with H.R . 2225 , the NSF for the Future Act is a comprehensive and strategic approach for investing in American research and development . For decades , America has been the global leader in science and technology development . That success is no accident . It is the result of two things : A cultural commitment to innovation and exploration , and a sustained investment in basic research . This is what makes us uniquely successful . The Federal Government funds high-risk , high-reward basic research that expands our fundamental knowledge of science and technology . This research , which is too costly for the marketplace to fund , produces discoveries that can then be commercialized through private industry . Our system maximizes taxpayer investment and takes advantage of strong public-private partnerships to keep America at the cutting edge of technological progress . Unfortunately , our adversaries in China are investing more than us in R & D in an attempt to take over the lead in science and technology . The way to stay ahead of China is not adopting their method of a top- down , government-mandated , applied research agenda . It is to reinvest in the basic research , infrastructure , and STEM workers that have always driven American progress . H.R . 3593 does just that . It is the first comprehensive authorization of the Office of Science , which is the largest Federal sponsor of basic research in the physical sciences of our Nation. The DOE Science for the Future Act invests $ 50 billion over 5 years in the Office of Science and the national labs , national scientific user facilities , and the thousands of researchers its supports . The DOE Science for the Future Act is an investment in our technological and clean energy future . It funds research into materials , chemical , biological , and environmental sciences , as well as fusion energy , advanced computing capacities , and cutting edge technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum sciences . We already know that investments in basic research pay large dividends . For example , basic research conducted in our national labs gave us improved hydraulic fracturing technology and allowed us to produce more clean natural gas . This reduced emissions , lowered energy costs for Americans , and helped us become a net total energy exporter for the first time in decades . That is why everyone who cares about clean energy must care about the research supported by H.R . 3593 . Investing in high-risk , early-stage research into cutting edge technologies is the only way to ensure that America stays at the head of the clean energy economy . Another important provision in the DOE Science for the Future Act is the creation of a crosscutting Emerging Infectious Disease Research Initiative to build on the work of the DOE to better model , understand , and fight infectious diseases . As they have shown time and again during the COVID-19 pandemic , our national labs have an important role to play in supporting public health . This legislation gives them the resources they need to continue this work . H.R . 3593 also funds much-needed infrastructure updates for our national labs and user facilities . Our ability to conduct world-leading science depends on having access to world-leading equipment and facilities . It also requires having skilled STEM professionals to conduct that research . Our bill includes workforce development and education provisions so that we have a thriving STEM pipeline to fill the technological jobs of the future . Mr. Speaker , H.R . 3593 is a forward-looking bill that is badly needed right now to drive American progress and to keep us globally competitive . As with the NSF for the Future Act , this legislation was drafted with extensive input in a bipartisan fashion , and the result is a strategic and responsible investment in the next generation of breakthrough energy technologies . I thank my friend Chairwoman Johnson for all her work with me on this bill , and I urge my colleagues to pass this now . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . '\n",

H.R . 3593 redoubles our commitment to the basic research conducted by the Office of Science  of the Department of Energy and our national laboratories . Together with the NSF for the Future Act , it is a comprehensive and sustainable approach to American competitiveness . Mr. Speaker , I thank my staff for everything they have done to help draft this important legislation . I thank my friend , Chairwoman Johnson , and her staff for working with us to include Republican priorities and ensure that this is a truly bipartisan bill .

Let me quickly indicate that as I have embraced the NDAA over the years , it has always been my focus to deal with the military personnel and to make us the best , the strongest , and the most well respected and appreciated . I want to thank this committee and the Rules Committee for allowing my amendments Nos . 191 , 192 , 193 , 194 , 195 , 196 , 197 , and 198 . Many of them speak for themselves . Let me clearly say that I have worked year after year as a breast cancer survivor to ensure that triple-negative breast cancer , which is one of the most deadly forms of cancer -- that women in the military have the services that they need . Let me just share with you that triple-negative breast cancer has a survival rate of 5 years . The key to beating this cancer is early detection . There is $ 10 million to enhance research and to help these women . In addition , I have asked for $ 2 million for post-traumatic stress disorder . I even , under then-Colonel Murtha , organized a center in my district . But the most important point for supporting this amendment is that it still exists -- Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom , 11 to 20 out of 100 ; Gulf war , 12 out of 100 ; Vietnam war , 30 out of 100 . It is still needed , and we appreciate this amendment . I also want to thank you for recognizing that we are going into space . My amendment says that we should have a bill that studies the risks proposed by man-made space debris in lower orbit , including recommendations and remediation of such risks . It is extremely important . Finally , I want to speak to a very important amendment dealing with the longstanding history of African Americans in the United States military , to create a task force that respects the fact that Crispus Attucks , a runaway slave who escaped -- during the Boston Massacre to the present day -- an escaped slave who fought in the Revolutionary War with George Washington . This story is a long-story story . The United States Army and others have a very long history . This task force will determine the impact of slavery and the impact of our soldiers from the very early years , who happened to be ex-slaves fighting all the way through the many different wars . I believe we will find that those who are descendants of enslaved Africans have fought in wars from the very beginning . It is an important story . It should be told . I am very pleased that this particular amendment is included .'\n",
    "rawsjl2 = ' Mr. Speaker , I will just conclude that this task force , which will be a very significant historical study , will be very much appreciated . But let me quickly say that having worked with our various nominees to the military academies , one in particular was an individual who stuttered . By the time he finished , they said he could not have his command . They never assessed him in the academy while he was there . I believe this is an important assessment , to assess that vital $ 250,000 student , so that when he graduates , he will have a command even if he is a stutterer because he made it into the academy ; he was successful academically ; and he should be allowed to serve his country . I thank you for considering my amendments and for them to stay in to become law . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of my Amendments in the En Bloc Amendment No . 2 to H.R . 4350 , the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2022 , which incorporates Jackson Lee Amendments Nos . 191 , 192 , 193 , 194 , 195 , 196 , 197 , and 198 . I thank the Rules Committee for making these amendments in order . I also thank Chairman Smith of the House Armed Services Committee and his staff for working with me and my staff to include the Jackson Lee Amendments in this En Bloc , and for his great work in shepherding the bill to the floor . The amendments included in En Bloc No . 2 are as follows : 1 . Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No . 191 -- Provides authorization for a $ 10 million increase in funding for increased collaboration with NIH to combat Triple Negative Breast Cancer . 2 . Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No . 192 -- Provides authorization for $ 2.5 million increase in funding to combat posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . 3 . Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No . 193 -- Directs the Secretary of Defense to [ [ Page H4986 ] ] promulgate regulations to ensure that candidates granted admission to attend a military academy undergo screening for speech disorders and be provided the results of the screening test and a list of warfare unrestricted line ( URL ) Officer positions and occupation specialists that require successful performance on the speech test . Academy students shall have the option of undergoing speech therapy to reduce speech disorders or impediments . 4 . Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No . 194 recognizes that Black men and women have played an integral role in the defense of the nation from the bravery of Crispus Attucks , an escaped slave , during the Boston Massacre to the present day , and seeks to determine how to address the historical and current barriers to their participation and equal treatment in the Armed Services . 5 . Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No . 195 -- Requires report on Maternity Mortality Rates for military members and their dependents . 6 . Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No . 196 -- Requires a report to be submitted to Congress within 240 days following enactment on the risks posed by debris in low earth orbit and to make recommendations on remediation of risks and outline plans to reduce the incident of space debris . 7 . Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No . 197 -- Requires the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress programs and procedures employed to ensure students studying abroad through Department of Defense National Security Education Programs are trained to recognize , resist , and report against recruitment efforts by agents of foreign governments . 8 . Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No . 198 -- Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress within 180 days a report on the recognition of African Americans who have served in the Armed Forces in DOD naming practices and conventions for military installations , infrastructure , vessels , and weapon systems . Jackson Lee Amendment 191 provides authorization for a $ 10 million increase in funding for increased collaboration with NIH to combat Triple Negative Breast Cancer . As a Member of Congress , a mother , a sister , a spouse , and a breast cancer survivor , I feel a special responsibility to do all I can to ensure every American can win in the fight against all types of breast cancer but especially triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) . What is triple negative breast cancer ? The term triple negative breast cancer refers to the fact that this form of breast cancer will test negative , which means that each of the tests will return negative results for the presence of breast cancer for three types of breast cancer tests : Estrogen receptor ; Progesterone receptor ; and Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 or the HER2 test will be negative . In addition , triple-negative breast cancer : Tends to be more aggressive than other types of breast cancer ; Five-year survival rates also tend to be lower for triple-negative breast cancer ; and Triple Negative Breast Cancer tends to be higher grade than other types of breast cancer . Studies have shown that triple-negative breast cancer is more likely to spread beyond the breast and more likely to recur ( come back ) after treatment . For example , a study of more than 1,600 women in Canada published in 2007 found that women with triple-negative breast cancer were at higher risk of having the cancer recur outside the breast -- but only for the first 3 years . As years go by , the risks of the triple-negative breast cancer recurring become similar to those risk levels for other types of breast cancer . The key to beating this cancer is not just early detection -- but detection period . A 2007 study of more than 50,000 women with all stages of breast cancer found that 77 percent of women with triple-negative breast cancer survived at least 5 years , versus 93 percent of women with other types of breast cancer . Another study of more than 1,600 women published in 2007 found that women with triple-negative breast cancer had a higher risk of death within 5 years of diagnosis , but not after that time period . The recurrence and survival figures in these and other studies are averages for all women with triple-negative breast cancer . Factors such as the grade and stage of the breast cancer will influence the prognosis of an individual woman. About 15-20 percent of breast cancers are triple negative . Triple Negative tumors tend to occur more often in younger women and African-American women . In studies of U.S. and British women , triple negative breast cancer appears to be more common among black women ( especially before menopause ) compared to white women . Triple negative breast cancer may also be more common among Hispanic women compared to white women . Although the reasons for racial/ethnic differences in rates of triple negative breast cancer are not clear , lifestyle factors may play a role . For example , some findings show African-American women tend to have lower rates of breastfeeding compared to other women , which may increase the chances of having triple negative breast cancer . For these individuals and the tens of thousands of survivors and their daughters this amendment is needed . Jackson Lee Amendment 192 provides authorization for $ 2.5 million increase in funding to combat post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . PTSD was first brought to public attention in relation to war veterans , but it can result from a variety of traumatic incidents , such as torture , being kidnapped or held captive , bombings , or natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes . People with PTSD may startle easily , become emotionally numb ( especially in relation to people with whom they used to be close ) , lose interest in things they used to enjoy , have trouble feeling affectionate , be irritable , become more aggressive , or even become violent . They avoid situations that remind them of the original incident , and anniversaries of the incident are often very difficult . Most people with PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma in their thoughts during the day and in nightmares when they sleep . These are called flashbacks . A person having a flashback may lose touch with reality and believe that the traumatic incident is happening all over again . My amendment recognizes that these soldiers are , first and foremost , human . They carry their experiences with them . Ask a veteran of Vietnam , Iraq , or Afghanistan about the frequency of nightmares they experience , and one will realize that serving in the Armed Forces leaves a lasting impression , whether good or bad . According to the National Center for PTSD , the number of Veterans with PTSD varies by service era : Operations Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) and Enduring Freedom ( OEF ) : About 11- 20 out of every 100 Veterans ( or between 11-20 percent ) who served in OIF or OEF have PTSD in a given year . Gulf War ( Desert Storm ) : About 12 out of every 100 Gulf War Veterans ( or 12 percent ) have PTSD in a given year . Vietnam War : It is estimated that about 30 out of every 100 ( or 30 percent ) of Vietnam Veterans have had PTSD in their lifetime . Another cause of PTSD in the military can be military sexual trauma ( MST ) . This is any sexual harassment or sexual assault that occurs while you are in the military . MST can happen to both men and women and can occur during peacetime , training , or war . Among Veterans who use VA health care , about : 23 out of 100 women ( or 23 percent ) reported sexual assault when in the military . 55 out of 100 women ( or 55 percent ) and 38 out of 100 men ( or 38 percent ) have experienced sexual harassment when in the military . My amendment will help ensure that `` no soldier is left behind '' by addressing the urgent need for more outreach toward hard-to-reach veterans suffering from PTSD , especially those who are homeless or reside in underserved urban and rural areas of our country .

    "rawslj3 = 'Jackson Lee Amendment 194 recognizes that Black men and women have played an integral role in the defense of the nation , from the bravery of Crispus Attucks , an escaped slave , during the Boston Massacre to the present day , and seeks to determine how to address the historical and current barriers to their participation and equal treatment in the Armed Services . Black Americans became pilots , nurses , Marines , and West Point graduates , but it was not until President Harry S. Truman issued an executive order in 1948 that the armed services were integrated ; and even then , some units refused to do so for several more years . In 1777 , when George Washington faced a dearth of white soldiers willing to fight on behalf of the colonies , he allowed Black men to fight in the continental army and during the harsh winter of 1778 the Rhode Island Assembly , therefore , passed a law in 1778 allowing `` every able-bodied negro , mulatto , or Indian man slave in this state to enlist . '' 100 black soldiers signed up in exchange for their freedom . During the Civil War , around 179,000 Black men served in the Union army , either in the Army , Navy , or non-combat positions and more than 40,000 gave the last full measure of devotion to their country . Over 125,000 Black soldiers served overseas in the segregated military during World [ [ Page H4987 ] ] War II , but the U.S. military remained segregated . When Black veterans came home , many found it difficult to get housing or jobs because White veterans were given preference . The racial inequality and mistreatment of Black men and women that has historically permeated our military continues to this day , with more than 750 complaints of discrimination by race or ethnicity from service members in the fiscal year 2020 alone . But discrimination does not exist just within the military rank-and- file , as in that same fiscal year , civilians working in the financial , technical , and support sectors of the Army , Air Force ; and Navy also filed 900 complaints of racial discrimination and over 350 complaints of discrimination by skin color , data from the U.S . Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shows . According to a report by the DoD Diversity and Inclusion Board , while the enlisted ranks of the active and reserve military were `` slightly more racially and ethnically diverse than its U.S. civilian counterparts , '' the opposite was true for the officer corps . With the rise and normalization of white supremacist expression during the Trump administration , the concept of restorative justice has gained more urgency , garnering the attention of mainstream commentators , and illustrating the need for a national reckoning . We owe it to those brave men and women who have proven time and time again to be an integral part of our military to examine the history of discrimination of the Armed Services and to determine the necessary steps to repair the harm caused by these inequities . Jackson Lee Amendment No . 96 directs that the Secretary of DoD provide a report 240 days from enactment of this bill on the risks posed by man-made space debris in low-earth orbit , including recommendations on remediation of such risks , and outlines of plans to reduce the incident of space debris . Space debris encompasses both natural and artificial particles . This Jackson Lee Amendment would address the risk of man-made space debris . Man-made objects in the orbit of Eath that may no longer serve a useful function can include nonfunctional spacecraft , abandoned launch vehicle stages , mission-related debris and fragmentation debris . Space debris travels at speeds up to 17,500 miles per hour is fast enough for a small piece of man-made debris to damage a satellite or a spacecraft . There are more than 20,000 pieces of debris larger than a softball orbiting the Earth . There are 500,000 pieces of debris the size of a marble or larger . There are many millions of pieces of debris that are so small they cannot be tracked . NASA tracks more than 500,000 pieces of man-made space debris in the orbitof Earth. This amendment seeks a report from the Secretary of Defense on the risks posed by man-made space debris , solutions for reducing risks and strategies for reducing the incidence of more man-made space debris being introduced into space . I urge all members to vote for En Bloc Amendment No . 2 and the underlying legislation , H.R . 4350 , the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2022'\n",

    "rawjl = 'James LANGEVIN . Madam Speaker , today it is an honor for me to pay tribute to the Office of Naval Research and its contributions to our Sea Services , the Nation , and the pursuit of scientific and technological discovery on the occasion of its seventy-fifth anniversary . The Office of Naval Research was established by act of Congress on August 1 , 1946 , in the aftermath of World War II to `` plan , foster , and encourage scientific research in recognition of its paramount importance as related to the maintenance of future naval power , and the preservation of national security . '' A product of wartime necessities that brought together government and military planners , academia , and industry to help make science and technology an essential tool [ [ Page E857 ] ] for victory , the Office of Naval Research grew into a vital organization dedicated to the enduring warfighting requirements of the Navy and Marine Corps and the peacetime needs of the nation . The Office of Naval Research prioritizes building a close and essential relationship between the public good and the progress of science and technology . For seventy-five years this agency has maintained that relationship through war and peace . Much of our infrastructure for the public support of science and technology . from the National Science Foundation to DARPA to the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Army Research Office , was built in the years after the war using the model pioneered by the Office of Naval Research . In its early decades , the Office of Naval Research supported research in the burgeoning fields of computing and directed energy , leading to the development of one of the first digital computers , Project Whirlwind , as well as the creation of the maser and laser . Its projects took scientists to the upper atmosphere in some of the highest recorded balloon ascents and brought human beings to the very bottom or the ocean in the Challenger Deep . Office of Naval Research-supported engineers and scientists created the first autonomous robot , as well as the first autonomous undersea vehicle . The Office of Naval Research , Arctic Research Laboratory helped several generations of scientists understand polar environments better . Its support led to the development of atomic clocks ; the key invention that made precision satellite navigation possible . Finally , and perhaps most of all , long- term support from the Office of Naval Research led to the postwar blossoming of the ocean sciences , leading to countless discoveries in acoustics , wave prediction , meteorology , marine mammal research , and climate studies . The invention of virtually every important sensor and undersea vehicle that made these discoveries possible owes a debt to the stewardship of the Office of Naval Research . From aircraft to ships to weapons systems , nearly every platform in use by the Navy and Marine Corps today relies in some way on technology originally developed or enhanced by the sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research . Medical advances such as QuikClot save the lives of Marines and Sailors . Portable energy technologies provide power to forces , vehicles , and sensors . Laser weapon systems defend ships at sea . Materials developed through Office of Naval Research efforts protect the hulls of ships from marine organisms as well as the blast effects of weapons , and allow jet engines to work hotter , longer , and more efficiently than ever before . Today , Office of Naval Research programs are advancing the fields of artificial intelligence , autonomy , networking , directed energy , warfighter performance , maritime awareness , and next-generation power for the Navy and Marine Corps of the future . Madam Speaker , I am proud to honor the achievements of the Office of Naval Research , and I am certain the Members of the House will join me in recognizing the seventy-five years of scientific excellence this distinguished organization has provided -- and seventy-five more that it will provide -- to our Sailors and Marines and to the American people . '\n",
    "rawjl2 = 'Madam Speaker , I thank the chairman for yielding . Madam Speaker , I rise in strong support of the National Defense Authorization Act . I commend Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers [ [ Page H4799 ] ] for their bipartisan cooperation in bringing the bill to the floor . I also want to thank Ranking Member Banks and former Ranking Member Stefanik for their bipartisan collaboration this year . I would also like to thank the members of the Cyber , Innovative Technologies , and Information Systems Subcommittee for their hard work , particularly Vice Chair Houlahan . Thanks to the work of my subcommittee , this legislation harnesses cutting-edge technology to benefit our warfighters and our national security . This legislation includes a 36 percent increase in defense- wide basic and applied research and development and significant increases for historically Black colleges and universities . This bill also includes many provisions recommended by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence , which I offered as a package of amendments during our committee markup . We are taking important steps in addressing the promises and challenges of this powerful technology , and I am thankful for the commission cochairs , Secretary Bob Work and Dr. Eric Schmidt , and members of that committee as well for their service . The NDAA builds off the important work of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission by establishing the Joint Collaborative Environment at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency , called CISA . This program , which will live at the newly established Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative , or JCDC , will facilitate public-private cooperation in analyzing cyber threats . Beyond the CITI provisions , the NDAA fully funds the Virginia-class and Columbia-class submarine programs which are crucial to our deterrence posture against China . I am so proud to represent the Rhode Islanders who construct these amazing vessels and do their part in keeping us safe . I am also proud of the reforms we made to the Uniform Code of Military Justice to address sexual assault and extremism and of our efforts to defend our military infrastructure against climate change . These achievements would not be possible , of course , without the work of my subcommittee staff : staff lead Michael Hermann ; Bess Dopkeen , Troy Nienberg , and Josh Stiefel .'\n",
    "rawlj3 = 'I also thank minority staff , Sarah Moxley . Our clerk , Caroline Kehrli , is departing the subcommittee , and her work has been incredibly invaluable . My legislative director , Caroline Goodson , and military fellow , Juliann Hitt , also made significant contributions to the bill . Madam Speaker , Chairman Smith has , once again , done a masterful job leading us through this process , and I urge all of my colleagues to support the NDAA .'\n",
    "rawlj4 = 'Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . Mr. Speaker , the United States attracts and develops some of the brightest minds in the world . They can fortify national security and boost economic competitiveness . Unfortunately , much of that talent leaves because there are few options to remain . My amendment provides a pathway to citizenship for the best foreign talent to work in the U.S. in support of our National Security Innovation Base . Great power competition is a race for talent to maintain our military and technological superiority . We want the brightest minds in the world working for us , not the Chinese Communist Party . The U.S. has less than 5 percent of the population of the world, so it is no surprise that many great scientific minds are born outside U.S. borders . So then how have we maintained our technological superiority over the last 70 years , by way of example ? Well , our world-class universities and innovative private sector attract future Nobel laureates in critical technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence . However , our constricted pathways to residency and citizenship drive this talent into the arms of our adversaries ; so we face intense competition from other countries who offer large research grants and expedited citizenship to lure this talent away . But it is not just potential adversaries . Some U.S. companies are setting up R & D facilities in Canada because their immigration policies more effectively attract highly-skilled workers . Under this amendment , the Secretary of Defense will implement a competitive annual process to select scientists with technical expertise in critical technologies and recommend them for proper processing and vetting . It is in our national security interests not only to have these scientists working on research on our behalf , but also to prevent this talent from working for our adversaries . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time .'\n",
    "rawlj5 = 'Mr. Speaker , let me just say that when the Secretary of Defense deems it vital to the national security interests of the United States , this would give that authority to grant this special pathway to the Secretary to make that determination . A special immigrant visa , by the way , to streamline the admission of applicants in the name of national security is not new . My amendment is modeled after a 1949 law granting the Director of the CIA the authority to obtain permanent residency for anyone deemed `` in the interest of national security or essential to the furtherance of national intelligence missions . '' Today , the Secretary of Defense has no mechanism for retaining top technical and scientific talent who are vital to national security . Unsurprisingly , the Department of Defense explicitly endorses the amendment . So , again , my amendment is not new or groundbreaking to the immigration conversation . In fact , again , it provides the Secretary of Defense with the same authority that the Director of the CIA has enjoyed since 1949 . This authority is not challenged as a less strident or reckless method that our adversaries exploit because it does not circumvent the current immigration process . All the Secretary of Defense innovation referrals are subject to the same rigorous and extensive background checks that any other applicant receives . I am confident that they will properly vet these applicants as we will keep the best talent in the world working on our behalf . I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment to ensure our continued military and technological superiority . Mr. Speaker , I yield back the balance of my time .'\n",
    "rawlj6 = 'Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of the en bloc package , which contains amendment No . 384 to create four critical technology security centers . These centers would be created through competitive grants issued by the Department of Homeland Security to universities or federally funded research and development centers , including national laboratories . Each center would have a different focus , with the first four covering network technology , network industrial control systems , open source software , and Federal critical software , respectively . Each center would rigorously test the security of a set of technologies developed with input from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency , or CISA , the compromise of which would represent the highest level of risk to our critical infrastructure . With respect to those specific technologies , centers would evaluate their overall security posture ; develop new tools and capabilities for vulnerability discovery , management , and mitigation ; and support the remediation of the vulnerabilities they find . This is an important recommendation of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission , and I thank my fellow Commissioner , Mr. Gallagher , for cosponsoring this amendment . I also thank Chairman Thompson for his support of the measure . I urge Members to support the en bloc package and the underlying bill .'\n",
    "rawlj7 = 'Madam Speaker , I thank the gentleman for yielding . Madam Speaker , I rise today in strong support of the National Defense Authorization Act . I begin by congratulating and thanking Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers , as well as my counterparts on the CITI Subcommittee , Ranking Member Banks and former Ranking Member Stefanik for their bipartisan collaboration in helping to craft a national defense bill for the 61st consecutive year . Thanks to the work of my subcommittee , this legislation includes a significant increase in early-stage research . Our research enterprise has always ensured our technology superiority . It is how we won the space race . Today , as the battlefield expands into cyberspace and outer space , we find ourselves facing a more aggressive Russia and China . I am proud that Congress has unlocked funds for hypersonics defense , directed energy , quantum computing , machine learning , and biotechnology so that we never send our war fighters into a fair fight . Madam Speaker , I am most proud that this bill includes many recommendations from the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence , including funds to accelerate the deployment of new technology to the war fighter . I am also proud that in our first year as a subcommittee , the Subcommittee on Cyber , Innovative Technologies , and Information Systems , we have made significant investments in our cybersecurity forces , set a course for improved cybersecurity governance within the Department , and continue to strengthen the Department of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency of the Department of Homeland Security. The NDAA also fully funds key national security platforms , the Virginia-class and Columbia-class submarine programs . I thank the Rhode Islanders who build the submarines of our Nation and make our country safer . Finally , this bill funds installation resilience projects to address the ongoing threat from climate change .

    "rawtt = 'Tom TIFFANY . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . The ramifications of this amendment could be dangerous and far- reaching . Quite frankly , we should not be looking outside of the United States for such scientists and researchers . We should cultivate our own talent . Unfortunately , this bill does nothing to develop that talent . We must ask , which foreign nationals would be eligible for the program ? Most likely , those from China . China is so intent on using our U.S. immigration system to steal our sensitive technologies that the Trump administration had to issue a proclamation suspending entry of certain Chinese students and researchers . The Trump administration proclamation stated : `` The Peoples Republic of China is engaged in a wide-ranging and heavily resourced campaign to acquire sensitive United States technologies . . . to bolster the modernization and capability of its military . '' The proclamation went on to state that `` students or researchers from the PRC studying beyond the undergraduate level . . . are at high risk of being exploited or co-opted by the PRC . '' Because of the brutal nature of the Chinese Communist Party , the same is true for virtually any Chinese national who comes to the United States to study or research , or to otherwise work in sensitive technologies like those contemplated under this amendment . In fact , the Department of Homeland Security told us last year that the Chinese government requires its nationals to `` support , assist , and cooperate with State intelligence work . '' The idea for this amendment came , at least in part , from the Commission on Artificial Intelligence , which called for `` increasing China brain drain . '' So clearly , the green cards contemplated under this amendment would go to Chinese nationals . The last thing we should do is make it easy for the Chinese Communist Party to gain access to our National Security Innovation Base work , Department of Defense research , or other critical technologies . I would also note that , sadly , the Department of Defense does not have a great track record regarding immigrant programs . Many of you may remember that the Department of Defense supported and encouraged the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest program through which foreign nationals were able to enlist in the U.S. military . Once enlisted , they were eligible to naturalize . The Department of Defense was not living up to its promise to adequately vet and perform high-level background checks on the MAVNI participants . The program was halted by the Obama administration when it was discovered that the Department had allowed some Chinese spies to enlist in the military . Let that sink in . The Department of Defense let Chinese spies enlist in the U.S. military . So I am not comfortable with several aspects of the program created by this amendment . I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time .'\n",
    "rawtt2 = 'Mr. Speaker , so once again , we hear that this will be a small number of people that are coming in . All we have to do is look at our southern border and other places for hearing about how small numbers of people are going to come into our country . We also hear , trust the Secretary of Defense . As I cited in my opening remarks , we had a real problem with the MAVNI program , where the Obama administration discovered Chinese spies in our military . This is a serious , serious situation . And here is the thing that I find frustrating , Mr. Speaker . We have so many people that project our freedoms and how we view them on other countries , including China , that they treat their people the same way . They simply do not , and it is fully proven that the Chinese Communist Party demands complete fealty of anyone , whether they are in China , or they come to our country to go back and give all information to the Chinese Communist Party . They do not protect intellectual property rights , which are a foundation of our freedoms here in America . We should not be sanguine about what this amendment will do .

This bill is also the product of the diligent work of the committee staff whom I would like to thank including the Strategic Forces Subcommittee PSMs , Maria Vastola , Grant Schneider , Ryan Tully , Whitney Verett , and Zach Taylor , as well as the  majority staff director of the committee , Paul Arcangeli , and minority staff director , Chris Vieson . Admiral Richard , the Commander of U.S. Strategic Command , has told us we are facing a situation our Nation has not encountered before . We must deter two peer nuclear-capable competitors simultaneously and must do so with each being deterred differently . I am confident that the FY 2022 NDAA before us today places us on the right path to properly observe both Russia and China . First and foremost , the bill increases top line defense spending by nearly $ 25 billion , reversing the harmful and reckless cuts from the budget of the President, ensuring an annual growth of 5 percent over the previous year , and funding the most critical unfunded priorities of the DDD . Next , with one exception , the NDAA continues to fully fund programs within the Department of Defense and Department of Energy that modernize the nuclear triad of the Nation and modernize the nuclear command , control , and communications systems . This is especially critical to maintaining a safe , secure , and reliable strategic deterrent while China is undergoing an unprecedented and massive nuclear build-up and Russia is undertaking significant modernization of all three legs of its triad . Also , both Russia and China are developing brand-new , novel nuclear delivery systems . This NDAA fully funds capabilities necessary for the defense of Guam and prohibits reduction of our ICBM inventory while simultaneously halting efforts to retire or reconvert our low-yield nuclear warheads , which are currently deployed in defense of our Nation . And this NDAA reverses the detrimental and dangerous budgetary cuts to our missile defense systems of President Biden. Madam Speaker , I encourage all Members to support this bill .'\n",

This is , as the chairman was saying , the one time a year that we all come together , and that is counter to the narrative you see in Washington , that this truly is a bipartisan product . I thank the committee staff for continuing that culture . Madam Speaker , DOD leaders have made it clear that we must do more to deter adversaries . I am confident that this bill will do that in countering both Russia and China . As the ranking member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee , I am particularly proud of the progress this bill makes on the issues of nuclear modernization missile defense in space . Specifically , the bill fully funds our triad modernization program , to include the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent , the Long-Range Standoff Weapon , the B83 gravity bomb life extension , and the two-site solution for plutonium pit production in Los Alamos and the Savannah River Site . The bill prohibits the retirement or reconversion of the W76-2 low- yield warhead ; requires the integration of the LRSO air-launched cruise missile with the B-21 bomber ; and creates a floor of 400 U.S. ICBMs . On missile defense , it fully funds the Next Generation Interceptor and supports ensuring our homeland missile defense outpaces the North Korean ICBM threat . It also funds Guam and additional THAAD interceptors . On Space , we continue to push for declassification of programs that will help us counter China and Russia .

    "rawrw = 'Roger WICKER . Mr. President , the 21st century will be shaped by the outcome of the strategic competition between the United States and China . Like our Nation  previous contest with the Soviet Union , the outcome of this great contest will help determine the world that our children and our grandchildren live in . There are only two real possibilities : Either the United States will remain the preeminent global superpower or we will be replaced by China . This truth is recognized on both sides of the aisle in this body . The contest between our two countries will involve every aspect of national life -- including military might , diplomatic skill , economic strength , and the deepest values that shape our societies . The scope and complexity of this challenge calls for bold action , and that is what the Endless Frontier Act is about . This week the Senate has an opportunity to come together on a bipartisan basis and move forward on legislation , now known as the United States Innovation and Competition Act . This will make our Nation more economically competitive , improve protections for U.S. intellectual property and research , and keep us a step ahead of China in this area of high-stakes competition . This bill does so by increasing research at the National Science Foundation and dramatically increasing R & D at a new National Science Foundation directorate . Other Agencies in the Federal Government will also see dramatic increases in the important research that they perform . The Endless Frontier Act , as reported by the Commerce Committee , is a major part of this comprehensive legislative effort . Other committees have also been important partners in this legislation . In particular , I congratulate Chairman Menendez and Ranking Member Risch of the Foreign Relations Committee for producing the Strategic Competition Act , which was reported out of their committee on a 21-to-1 vote . I also commend Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Peters and Ranking Member Portman ; Banking Committee Chairman Brown and Ranking Member Toomey ; Health , Education , Labor , and Pensions Committee Chair Murray and Ranking Member Burr ; and Judiciary Chair Durbin and Ranking Member Grassley for their importan contributions to the substitute product . I will focus my remarks on the Commerce Committee  contributions to the Endless Frontier Act . Last week , the Commerce Committee held a markup to consider this legislation . We considered hundreds of amendments and adopted over 100 of them into the reported bill , including over 20 bipartisan , separately introduced bills . The markup at times was challenging , but in the end the bill passed the committee on a bipartisan 24-to-4 vote . The Endless Frontier Act will enhance U.S. science and technology leadership through key investments in R & D , regional economic development , and manufacturing . The bill will accomplish these goals in the following ways : First , it will preserve the core basic research mission of the National Science Foundation . The NSF is the world  gold standard for funding basic research , a sector that fuels new waves of innovation across our society . Basic research answers the fundamental questions of scientific inquiry needed to develop major innovations . The internet , GPS , cell phones , and many other breakthrough technologies have their origins in National Science Foundation-funded research . The Endless Frontier Act will authorize funding increases in NSF  core science portfolio to support the most promising research proposals . That is the first thing . Secondly , this bill will establish a new Directorate of Technology and Innovation at the NSF to drive faster innovation in key technology focus areas , such as artificial intelligence , or AI , and robotics . We included strong coordination measures to ensure that programs at the new Technology Directorate do not duplicate R & D programs of other Federal Agencies , such as the Department of Energy . These provisions are designed to ensure the wise [ [ Page S2755 ] ] expenditure of taxpayer dollars by preventing bureaucratic turf wars , which can slow down innovation . Third , this legislation will protect intellectual property and research from foreign governments -- most notably , China . The Endless Frontier Act will establish a research security office at the NSF and create a clearinghouse to share information about security risks . It also puts forward policies to protect controlled information , including a plan for background checks on researchers . In addition , it will take critical steps to guard against Chinese intellectual property theft by prohibiting NSF funds from going to researchers who are part of a Chinese talent program or an institution with formal ties to a Confucius Institute . This is a new and important step . Fourth , this bill will reduce the geographic concentration of R & D in a handful of States and universities . Put simply , this bill will be a game changer for the R & D geographic diversity that many of us have sought for years , if not decades . America can maintain our leadership over China only with a sustained effort that is national in scope . We should tap into the wide-ranging talents , expertise , and capabilities of Americans across this land , including Nevada and Mississippi . The Endless Frontier Act will help address these long-standing disparities by increasing funding for the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research , which we have all come to know as EPSCoR . Participation in EPSCoR helps institutions in many States and Territories improve their research capacities and , therefore , compete more effectively for Federal R & D funding . The legislation also invests in minority serving institutions and builds up research capacity in emerging institutions , which have traditionally received a relatively small share of Federal research dollars . No . 5 , this bill will boost regional economic development through the Regional Technology Hub Program . No . 6 , it will support manufacturing programs , in part , by quadrupling the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program , which already exists . No . 7 , it will help America win the `` New Space Race '' against China by including the NASA Authorization Act , which the Senate passed unanimously last year . The NASA bill allows Congress to set priorities and guardrails for the space Agency  exploration and research programs . No . 8 , this bill will authorize a number of telecommunication programs to improve our telecom workforce and help get all Americans connected to high-speed and reliable broadband . This bill also includes several bills that I have championed , including the Rural STEM Education Act , the Advanced Technological Manufacturing Act , the Improving Minority Participation and Careers in Telecommunications Act , and the Telecommunications Supply Chain Diversity Promotion Act -- significant legislation and a mouthful , too . Overall , this is a strong bill , but it can be made better . As I mentioned at the Commerce Committee  markup last week , although the bill reported out of the committee makes important changes to the underlying bill , I regret the rushed process that was followed . The underlying bill was introduced on April 20 , just under a month ago . Only yesterday , Senate Majority Leader Schumer laid down a 1,400- page substitute that not only includes the Endless Frontier Act , but major legislation from the Foreign Relations , Homeland Security , Banking , HELP , and Judiciary Committees . Now known as the U.S . Innovation and Competition Act -- USICA , I suppose -- this legislation will make significant changes to our innovation ecosystem and the missions of our Federal Agencies . A bill of this magnitude would normally take a year to write and involve soliciting input from Members and stakeholders across our country to craft a consensus package . Clearly , the Senate should consider this bill with an open amendment process . Prematurely shutting down debate on amendments without this open process would send a false signal to China and the American people that we are divided in an area where , actually , we are united and together . And then , when all is said and done , the effort will have to be paid for and will be subject to appropriations . I hope the majority  determination to rush this legislation through the Senate is not designed to use a partisan reconciliation bill to appropriate funding for these important initiatives . Science has always been debated in a bipartisan way in this body . Leaving one party on the sidelines in the appropriation process , which I hope will not happen , would have a detrimental consequences for the long-term stability of this legislation . So on the whole , I am positive and optimistic about this bill and about the process that will get us to the end of both parties desire . I thank my colleague , Senator Cantwell , for her work as chair of the Commerce Committee to get this bill on the floor today , and I look forward to working with her to improve the bill in the next step in the process -- an open amendment process.'\n",
    "rawr2 = 'Mr. President , I certainly rise in support of this legislation and urge a `` yes  vote . This is an opportunity for the United States to strike a blow on behalf of answering the unfair competition that we are seeing from Communist China , and it is an opportunity to have a game changer in terms of geographic diversity in our research effort . This morning , the Armed Services Committee heard extensive testimony about the need to compete with China at the military level . This is an opportunity to compete with China at the research level . This bill will strengthen our country  innovation in key technology fields of the future -- in areas such as artificial intelligence , robotics , quantum computing , and communications . And this bill also is a game changer in terms of giving universities all over the United States an opportunity to participate in game- changing research , which will help us compete . Universities , largely in smaller States such as mine , have been left behind in the past . They will finally , under this legislation , have an opportunity to participate in research at a meaningful level -- so two good reasons to vote yes . The distinguished chair of the committee has been gracious in thanking all of our staffs on the majority and the minority side . I appreciate her doing that , as well as Senator Cantwell  admirable job of managing this bill through the committee . I congratulate the two authors of this bill , Senator Schumer and Senator [ [ Page S3979 ] ] Young , who sponsored this legislation . This bill is headed toward passage with a fine bipartisan vote , and I am pleased to support passage .'\n",

    "rawds = 'Dan SULLIVAN . Mr. President , I want to commend my colleagues for the important work that everybody is doing down here on the Senate floor , bipartisan work , addressing one of the most important challenges we have as a nation . Not just today but for years this challenge is going to be with us , and that is the challenge of dealing with the rise of the Communist Party of China . That is going to be more and more of a challenge and focus of the efforts of all elements of America  economy , military , society . And here is the good news . As you are seeing here , there is a lot of focus , a lot of effort , and a lot of bipartisan work . It is a democracy , a Republic , right ? It is messy . It is not going to be perfect . But , for the Chinese , I think the worst nightmare of the Chinese Communist Party is to see Americans coming together and recognizing that this is something we all need to work on together . China  economy is growing . Their high-tech capability is growing . Their military capability is growing . Their aggressiveness throughout the region is growing . Just look in the last year : Hong Kong ; the disputes along the China- India border with India ; the aggressiveness toward Taiwan ; the economic embargo , in many ways , against our ally Australia ; Xinjiang Province ; the full discrimination against the Uighurs . And , of course , China is now fully focused on exporting its authoritarian model abroad -- not just at home but abroad . But again , as I mentioned , the good news is that we as a nation , we as a Senate , we as a Congress , Republicans and Democrats , are starting to awaken to this challenge . This is an issue I have been focused on since I came to the Senate over 6 years ago . I think the previous administration , the Trump administration , with their National Security Strategy , National Defense Strategy , which said , hey , we know we have challenges with violent extremists organizations , but we need to start shifting our focus to great power competition with China as the pacing threat -- that is where we should be focused . Those strategy documents -- the National Defense Strategy , the National Security Strategy -- these were actually quite bipartisan documents , quite bipartisan strategies . The National Defense Authorization Act , which will be taken up here in a couple of months , in the last few years has been built around this National Defense Strategy , focusing on great power competition -- China , Russia . So that is continuing . It is actually continuing on the floor here in the U.S. Senate as we speak . What I have been trying to do is work with Members on both sides of the aisle -- certainly with the Trump administration but also with the Biden administration -- as they address this challenge . I had some good meetings with a number of senior officials in the administration , and one takeaway I got from discussing these issues with the National Security Advisor , Jake Sullivan , was a comment he had made about how when we were looking at our challenges with China , we need to think about these in the way in which Dean Acheson , who was a very famous Secretary of State , talked about the beginning of the Cold War with the Soviet Union in the late 1940s ; how America needs to be dealing with the Soviet Union and that Cold War from situations of strength , positions of strength . I thought that was a really insightful comment by the current National Security Advisor . So I want to mention a few of these because we have a lot of them relative to China . Our comparative advantages , in my view , are much greater than theirs in this competition that is going to , in my view , last for decades . So let me name a few of these situations of strength . First , our allies . The United States is an ally-rich nation . China is an ally-poor nation and getting poorer by the day , by the way . Maybe North Korea is one ally . Maybe Russia sometimes , but I do not really buy it . So that is a huge comparative advantage that we have as a nation , and we need to look at our system , our network of allies and deepen them and expand them . One area that that has happened with regard to our allies , really is a cornerstone of our alliance system in Asia , is the continued focus on what is called the Quad . The Quad is three of the biggest economies and democracies in the whole world : the United States , Japan , India , and Australia . The Quad actually began in terms of a focus of strategy in the George W. Bush administration . The Trump administration highlighted it even more . To the Biden administration  credit , they took the Minister- level meetings that were the focus of the Trump administration  effort with the Quad and took it to the leader level . President Biden met with the leaders -- India , Japan , Australia , and the United States -- recently . It is a very important development . The Quad can help anchor our alliances in the Asia-Pacific and beyond in a very significant way . The Chinese are constantly talking about it because they do not like it because they know what it signifies . So that is one area of strength , situation of strength that I think all of us can agree on , and I think Members of this body can certainly help play a role As we look to head into a work session , I am going to head to the Asia-Pacific with some of my Senate colleagues here -- Senator Duckworth , Senator Coons , and maybe a few others -- and we are going to help build on this important comparative advantage that we have as a nation -- allies . We are an ally-rich nation . China is ally-poor . The more aggressive they are acting in the region , the more this situation of strength is going to play to our advantage . Let me give you another situation of strength for the United States , particularly as it relates to China . It is a huge [ [ Page S3875 ] ] position of strength . It is our energy sector , the all-above energy sector for America -- I mean renewables , oil , natural gas . This is an area that for decades we have tried to become energy independent . We have tried to return to the status we had during World War II , which was the world  energy superpower in terms of the production of energy . The good news on that is we have returned to that . Prior to the pandemic , the United States had once again become the world  energy superpower -- a lot of people thought we could never achieve that again , but we have -- the largest producer of natural gas in the world , bigger than Russia ; largest producer of oil in the world , bigger than Saudi Arabia ; largest producer of renewables in the world . This is really good for our economy . It is really good for jobs . It is really good for our national security and foreign policy . And yes , it is really good for our environment . Why is that ? I know some people do not like the production of energy in America , but here is a fact : We need energy , `` all of the above '' energy . My State has it all , all the things that I just mentioned -- oil , gas , renewables . We have an enormous abundance in Alaska . But here is the other fact : We produced these energy opportunities , we produced this energy in America with a higher environmental standard than any other place on the planet . That is a fact . That is a fact . So if we need energy , which we do , `` all of the above '' energy , which we do , we need to make sure we are producing it in a place with the highest standards , in a place that will employ American people workers . By the way , energy jobs are great jobs . Here is one other thing . You look at the intel . You talk to people who know the region . The Communist Party in China recognizes this comparative advantage , and it scares the living daylight out of them because they are very energy dependent , and we have literally become , through the hard work and ingenuity of so many in our great Nation , energy independent . By the way , not only has this helped our environment , it has helped with regard to greenhouse gas emissions . From 2005 to 2017 , the United States reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by almost 15 percent -- 15 percent . You do not hear that often , but it is a fact -- more than any other industrialized nation in the world . China was going like this . Still is . By the way , right now , the latest numbers on greenhouse gas emissions -- China is producing more than the United States , the EU , and India combined . That is also a fact . So we have reduced global greenhouse gas emissions dramatically . Why ? We all know why . It was the revolution and the production of American natural gas . That is a fact . That is a fact . So if we want to grow our economy , have an enormous comparative advantage relative to China and adversaries like Russia , produce more good-paying jobs , protect our environment , and enhance our national security and foreign policy , continuing the production of `` all of the above '' energy , which we are going to need for decades , is something that we should be doing . Now , some in the Biden administration understand this . Others do not and want to restrict production of American energy , and when those people speak , guys like John Kerry , the leaders in China and Russia are smiling . They are smiling . Fortunately , this legislation here , the Endless Frontier Act , is focused on outcompeting the Chinese , all of us coming together and outcompeting them in many different areas -- artificial intelligence , quantum computing , and , yes , energy as well . Specifically , what is in the bill is called advanced energy and industrial efficiency technologies , advanced energy technologies . That is in the legislation . Again , I think it is here because we recognize what a critical , comparative advantage we have relative to China in this sector , so we want to take advantage of it . It is in the legislation . Advanced energy technology is not defined in this bill , but that is because the Congress has been abundantly clear on what this means . In my discussions with Senators and , more importantly , what the Congress has passed a number of times , advanced energy technology means what it states in the definition of a law unanimously passed in the Senate and in the House just two Congresses ago , 42 USC 18632 . It actually has the definition of advanced energy technology , which is what is the focus of this bill , the Endless Frontier Act . '\n",

    "rawjr = 'Jack REED . Madam President , on behalf of Senator Inhofe and myself , as the ranking member and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , we rise to commemorate and celebrate the Office of Naval Research and its contributions to our Sea Services , national defense , and the advancement of scientific and technological discovery on the occasion of its 75th anniversary . World War II underscored how science and technology could determine winners and losers on the battlefield . In the aftermath of the war , Congress established the Office of Naval Research on August 1 , 1946 , to `` plan , foster , and encourage scientific research in recognition of its paramount importance as related to the maintenance of future naval power , and the preservation of national security . '' Since then , the Office of Naval Research has been at the forefront of groundbreaking research that has resulted in lasting military supremacy not only on and in the seas , but also in the skies , on land , and in space . Its model of effective collaboration between military , government , academic , and industry entities also paved the way for further technological advancement , recreated not only in the other military services but also through National Science Foundation and DARPA . Put simply , its impact is seen and felt not only in our Armed Forces , but in the lives of all Americans . In its earliest days , the Office of Naval Research pioneered key fields of computing and directed energy . The office brought humans to the highest heights and the deepest depths , and its work led to some of the most consequential technological advancements of the 20th century , including : the laser ; Project Whirlwind , one of the first digital computers ; the first autonomous robot ; and the atomic clock , which made precision satellite navigation possible . The invention of virtually every important sensor and undersea vehicle that has allowed us to explore and better understand our vast oceans is a result of the stewardship of the Office of Naval Research . Moreover , nearly every platform used by the Navy and Marine Corps relies in some way on technology developed or advanced by the Office of Naval Research . From lifesaving medical advances such as QuikClot , to more lethal and effective ships and weapons , the Office of Naval Research has changed the way we fight and win wars . The Office of Naval Research will continue to shape the future as well ; its programs are continuously advancing the fields of artificial intelligence , autonomous weaponry , networking , directed energy , warfighter performance , maritime awareness , and next-generation power . We are proud to honor the achievements of the Office of Naval Research , and we hope the Members of the Senate will join us in recognizing the incredible innovation and scientific leadership this distinguished organization has provided not only to our sailors , marines , soldiers , airmen , and guardians , but also to the American people over the past 75 years .'\n",
    "rawjr2 = 'Mr. President , I rise to discuss the fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act . Over the coming days , the Senate will consider this bill , which the Armed Services Committee passed by a broad bipartisan margin of 23 to 3 in July . I look forward to debating and improving this bill , as we all work toward ensuring our military has the right tools and capabilities to combat threats around the globe and keep Americans safe . First , I would like to acknowledge Ranking Member Inhofe , whose leadership on this committee and this body has been invaluable . His commitment to our men and women in uniform is unwavering , and he was instrumental in helping to produce this bipartisan legislation . As we debate the NDAA , we must keep in mind that the United States is engaged in a strategic competition with China and Russia . These near- peer rivals do not accept U.S. global leadership or the international norms that have helped keep the peace for the better part of a century . This strategic competition is likely to intensify due to shifts in the military balance of power and diverging views of governance . And it is unfolding amidst climate change and the emergence of highly disruptive technologies . The interconnected nature of these threats will drive how we transform our tools of national power to respond . The passage of the FY2022 NDAA will be a critical step in meeting the complex challenges before us . Turning to the specifics of the Defense bill of this year, the NDAA authorizes $ 740 billion for the Department of Defense and $ 27 billion for national security programs within the Department of Energy . For the first time in years , this legislation , like the  budget requestof the President, does not include a separate overseas contingency fund , or OCO , request . Any war-related costs are included in the base budget . This bill contains a number of important provisions that I would like to highlight . To begin , we have a duty to ensure that the United States can outcompete , deter , and prevail against near-peer rivals . The NDAA supports the Department of Defense in this endeavor by providing the resources needed by the combatant commanders to carry out the national defense strategy , or NDS . Every 4 years , the Department reports the NDS to outline the national security objectives of the administration . The 2018 NDS provided a framework , and the DOD will release a new strategy in the coming months . In this regard , this bill creates a commission on the national defense strategy for the forthcoming NDS in order to boost our military advantage . Last year , the Armed Service Committee created the Pacific Deterrence Initiative -- or PDI -- to better align DOD resources in support of military-to-military partnerships to address the challenges posed by China . The billof this year extends and modifies the PDI and reiterates the intent of the committee to improve our force posture in the Indo-Pacific , to increase readiness and presence , and to build the capabilities of our partners and allies to counter these threats . Future investments under PDI should focus on military and nonmilitary infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region . This will assist in distributed military operations , and it will be more effective in countering predatory Chinese infrastructure development practices . The bill also requires the Secretary of Defense to provide recurring briefings on efforts to deter Chinese aggression and military coercion . It compels a briefing on the advisability and feasibility of increasing United States defense cooperation with Taiwan . It is important we help Taiwan improve its overall readiness and acquire asymmetric capabilities most likely to make the Chinese Government question their ability to take the island by force . I want to emphasize , however , that the ability of our Nation to deter China can not be based on military might alone . We must strengthen our network of allies and partners , which will be essential to any strategy for the Indo-Pacific region . We must also ensure that , as we shift our focus to the Indo-Pacific , we do not lose sight of priorities in other areas , like Europe . The bill of this year authorizes the continuation of the European Deterrence Initiative -- or the EDI -- recognizing the continued need to invest in support for our European allies and partners as we work toward the shared goal of deterring Russian aggression , addressing strategic competition , and mitigating shared security concerns , the most recent one being the amassing of Russian troops on the border of Ukraine . Turning to personnel , the key factor that makes the United States the greatest military power in the world is its people . We need to ensure that our uniformed personnel know every day how much we appreciate what they do and that we have their backs . Congress has done a good job in providing benefits to the military and their families , and the Defense bill of this year continues to do that . But our military is showing the strain of two decades of continuous deployments , and I am concerned that there has been a dangerous erosion of trust within the chain of command ; and issues such as racism , extremism , sexual harassment , and sexual assault have been allowed to fester and create friction and division . The Department of Defense is addressing those issues , but Congress must provide guidance and resources . To this end , the bill strengthens the All-Volunteer Force and improves the quality of life of the men and women of the total force : the Active Duty , the National Guard , and the Reserves ; their families ; and , importantly , the Department of Defense civilian employees , who contribute significantly to the effectiveness of our operations . It reinforces the principles of a strong , diverse , inclusive force and that force cohesion requires a command climate that does not tolerate extremism or sexual assault misconduct or racism ; and that quality healthcare is a fundamental necessity for servicemembers and their families . Importantly , this NDAA includes the funding necessary to support a 2.7 percent pay raise for both military servicemembers and the DOD civilian workforce . We have also included a provision that would amend the Military Selective Service Act to require the registration of women for Selective Service . I am proud of this position , which passed the Armed Services Committee on a broad bipartisan basis . Society , the military , and the nature of warfare itself have evolved significantly since the 1948 Military Selective Service Act passed . Back then , women were denied the opportunity to serve in [ [ Page S8412 ] ] combat roles and key leadership positions , and entire technologies and platforms did not even exist . Today , all military occupations , including combat roles , are open to women , and military success depends heavily on servicemembers with advanced education and technical skills in STEM , cyber , medicine , languages , and more . To be clear , I am hopeful that we will never have to draft again .'\n",
    "rawjr3 = 'If we do , however , it will be under circumstances so dire and existential that to voluntarily choose to enter the fight with anything less than our very best would be supremely foolish and potentially fatal . If we are going to have a Selective Service System , women must be a part of it . Basic equality and military readiness demand parity between the sexes to protect our country and uphold our values . In the meantime , it is time to end outdated sex discrimination and remove it from official policy and Federal law . The bill also creates a new category of bereavement leave for military personnel that would permit servicemembers to take up to 2 weeks of leave in connection with the death of a spouse or a child . Similarly , in an effort to provide greater care and support to our military men and women , it increases parental leave to 12 weeks for all servicemembers for the birth , adoption , or foster care placement of a child . It establishes a basic needs allowance to ensure that all servicemembers can meet the basic needs of their families , and it requires parity and special and incentive pays for members of the Reserve and the active components . In addition , I am proud that this bill makes historic changes to the military justice system to combat and discourage sexual assault and related misconduct within the military . Sexual assault is an unconscionable crime and a pervasive problem in the U.S. military and American society writ large . When it comes to the military , one of the basic ethics is that one must protect your comrades and your subordinates ; one can not exploit them . Sexual assault and sexual harassment is an example of unconscionable exploitation , and it must be eliminated . We must take comprehensive action to halt sexual misconduct , hold offenders accountable , and support survivors . While the military has tried to stop sexual assault in the ranks , it simply has not been enough . I commend President Biden , the Department of Defense , and the Independent Review Commission for their work on proposals , which we have considered during our markup and which are reflected in the bill . We will continue to work with the administration and the House to move toward enacting this momentous change . Turning now to the areas of air , land , and sea power , with respect to our services , we have taken steps to improve their capabilities , their readiness , and their ability to fight and win . This bill makes significant efforts to improve the readiness of the Navy and Marine Corps aircraft , ships , and weapons systems . It provides considerable investments in our next-generation Arleigh Burke-class destroyers , including an increase of $ 1.7 billion to restore a second guided missile destroyer to the budget of this year and $ 125 million for long lead material for our destroyer in fiscal year 2023 . The bill authorizes $ 4.8 billion for the Columbia-class submarine program and for industrial-based development and expansion in support of the Virginia and Columbia shipbuilding programs , an increase of $ 130 million . I was up at Quonset Point , RI , recently , where all submarines start their construction . Along with the Deputy Secretary of Defense , Secretary Hicks , we saw the progress that we are making to build two Virginia-class submarines a year and turning out the first Columbia- class ballistic missile ship to replace the Ohio class . We are moving forward . And , frankly , many believe -- as I do -- that undersea strength is the best form of deterrence that we have . And as we deploy more submarines , we will have a greater ability to deter potential conflict . This bill also increases the Landing Helicopter Assault replacement funding by $ 350 million and the Expeditionary Fast Transport vessel program by $ 270 million . Growing our surface and undersea warfare capabilities will be vital to our success in the Indo-Pacific region , and this NDAA makes important progress in this area . It is consistent with our defense strategy of shifting our focus to the Pacific , which requires a shift of resources to the Navy and Marine Corps . Similarly , the bill authorizes funding to strengthen naval aviation , including five additional F-35 fighter variants , one additional E-2D Hawkeye aircraft , two additional C-130J Hercules aircraft , an additional KC-130J tanker , two additional CH-53K helicopters , and two MQ-4C Triton unmanned aerial systems . Now , with respect to the Air Force , the bill increases authorization funding by providing an additional F-35A fighter , five additional F-15 fighters , and extensions on the minimal capacity of several Air Force platforms .'\n",
    "rawjr4 = 'With respect to the Army , I am pleased that the bill advances research and development in important future technologies and makes broad investments in generational Army modernization efforts and continues to upgrade significant enduring capabilities . Our bill focuses on filling critical deficiencies and increasing investments in rapidly evolving demands . Further , it funds rapid development and fielding of land-based , long-range fires , including the precision strike missile , medium-range capability , and long-range hypersonic weapons . It also provides funding for future long-range assault aircraft and future attack reconnaissance aircraft , increased funding for the future tactical unmanned aircraft system , and authorizes full funding for the AH-64 Apache attack helicopters and the UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters . We are at a critical junction in a technological race with our near- peer competitors . We have enjoyed a technological lead over the last many decades . That lead is shrinking , and we have to not only develop the best of new technologies ; we have to get them in the hands of our troops as quickly as possible . And that is what we are trying to do in this legislation . Again , the issue is deterrence first , and what will help deter any conflict will be the realization of our adversaries that they are going up against the most sophisticated , technologically capable military in the world , manned by the most dedicated and skillful women and men in the world . That is what we are hoping to encourage . Likewise , with respect to the Army , the bill supports the modernization of its ground combat vehicles , including the M1 Abrams tanks , Bradley Fighting Vehicles , Paladin self-propelled howitzer , tactical-type vehicles . Having the platforms and the personnel is critical , but they have got to be ready to go , and we have taken great pride in trying to improve the readiness of our forces . This NDAA authorizes more than $ 2.8 billion for additional military construction projects after funding other large projects in the budget request . This bill also includes a number of provisions that will help acquisition outcomes by strengthening the ability of DOD to analyze the defense industrial base , evaluate acquisition programs , and implement acquisition reform efforts . It also streamlines processes to allow the Pentagon to invest in and incorporate advanced commercial technologies to support defense missions and strengthen DOD small business programs to allow partnerships with innovative , high-tech companies . From post-World War II until very recently , we were really in an industrial age , and the United States led the world . We have now moved to a post-industrial age where the new technologies , the new innovations are not coming out of government labs or the Bell Labs ; they are coming out of small business ; they are coming out of young people who have come up with great ideas . And what we want to do and what we want to empower the Department of Defense to do is to be able to get those ideas , develop them , and incorporate them rapidly into our military forces . That means we have to develop partnerships with small business and think in a different way . We have to think about a more entrepreneurial acquisition system rather than `` this is the way we have always done it and are going to keep doing it . '' We also have another area that we have to pay attention to , and that is [ [ Page S8413 ] ] the area of the modernization of our nuclear triad . I recognize the concerns voiced by some of my colleagues about the cost of , and genuine disagreements about , the nuclear policyof our Nation.'\n",
    "rawjr5 = 'From my perspective , nuclear deterrence is the bedrock of our national defense . For our nuclear deterrent to be credible and to ensure these weapons never need to be used , they must be capable and ready for use . The deterrence that we have enjoyed for many , many decades has been gained by the acknowledgement by all other nuclear powers that we are more than capable to respond . Our allies and partners depend on the U.S. nuclear umbrella . That is one of the reasons why the proliferation which President Kennedy thought would be almost universal has not developed . And modernization of our strategic forces is necessary to ensure their dependability . One thing I think everyone agrees on , and I think often gets lost in the discussion , is another factor : arms control and modernization of our nuclear forces are inherently linked together . We must reinvigorate our efforts on arms control so that we do not have a situation where the proliferation issue becomes more obvious and more dangerous . So even as we modernize , we should seek ways to promote strategic stability , like the extension of the New START agreement and follow-on talks to cover new strategic weapons and further reduce nuclear stockpiles . The best way to reduce nuclear weapons is through negotiated mutual arms reductions rather than unilateral actions . That has been the history of the Cold War , which with the Soviets and the United States we were able , with every Presidency , to come up with some type of agreement . Unfortunately , we took , I think , a less aggressive posture in the last administration , but we have to renew significantly our arms control efforts and make them clear that it is mutual interest of Russia but also China because China is a growing nuclear power with a very deliberate plan to increase significantly their nuclear arsenals . We have to get a situation where there is at least a trilateral negotiation between the United States , China , and Russia for our own mutual benefit . And part of that is also not just looking at numbers but looking at the safeguards that each country places on the use of nuclear weapons . We do not want a situation where there is an accidental launch that triggers a catastrophic response . We have much to do . But I will emphasize again that simply rebuilding our triad without rebuilding our diplomacy is not the best path forward . What we have tried to do in this bill is to enhance deterrence through a number of factors , including recapitalizing the nuclear triad ; ensuring the safety and security and reliability of our nuclear stockpile , our delivery systems , and our infrastructure ; increasing capacity in theater and homeland missile defense ; and strengthening nonproliferation programs . We have -- particularly our land-based missile systems -- installations that were built in the 1960s . They are roughly 60 years old . They are showing wear and tear . And the delivery vehicles are also old . That is part of our modernization program . The Columbia class is the first of our new ballistic missile submarines . We have to replace the Ohio class because , frankly , that fleet will literally wear out . They will not be capable to go to sea at some point in the future . And that is why we are beginning right now . We are also looking at a new , sophisticated armor that will complement the other two legs of the triad . And because this involves the Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration , we authorized $ 20 billion for this effort . We have funded the other defense activities of the Department of Energy at $ 920 million and its nuclear energy activities at $ 149.8 million . This is all part of having an effective deterrence . Now , as we have seen , our adversaries are developing other capabilities at an alarming rate . With regard to hypersonics , it is especially clear that China is working to develop capabilities that evade current missile defense capabilities possessed by the United States and our allies . To address these threats , the bill authorizes the Missile Defense Agency to develop a highly reliable missile defense interceptor for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System . It also authorizes the procurement of the Iron Dome short-range rocket defense system , Davids Sling Weapon System , and Arrow 3 Upper Tier Interceptor Program to support our closest ally in the Middle East , Israel . There was a barrage emanating from the neighbors of Isreal of approximately 4,500 missiles over the last year . And Iron Dome , which was created by the Israeli Government , knocked down a significant number of those missiles protecting the State of Israel . So this is not an academic exercise ; this is supporting a close ally . And it is also clear , as I mentioned before , China is expanding its nuclear weapons stockpile at a faster rate than we have seen from any other nation . It appears that China is seeking to at least reach parity with the United States and Russia in its efforts to become a world- class military .'\n",
    "rawjr6 = ' To respond to this and the proliferation efforts of other countries , the NDAA authorizes $ 239.84 million for Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs to stop the proliferation of nuclear , chemical , and biological threats around the world . If you take those three aspects -- improving our military capability , invigorating our diplomacy , and actively using Cooperative Threat Reduction -- to lower the ability and capability of those that have nuclear weapons , that is the best path ahead . Now , we have understood over the last several years that what is causing a great deal of destruction in this world in every aspect is technology , including cyber space activities . And we , again , are trying to hone and invigorate our technological innovation in this area . Innovation has long given us the strongest economy and military in the world . But it must be nurtured and maintained through careful investments and strong leadership in both the public and private sectors . I believe we have an advantage because we have such a great educational system , a great entrepreneurial system , the creativity and talent of the American people , but we have to focus on needs for our military and national priorities . And our top priority for Congress must be maintaining strong investments in technology areas that we know will shape future conflicts . The NDAA of this year includes multiple provisions to accelerate the modernization of the Department of Defense by investing in research and development of cutting-edge technologies and delivering them in a timely manner to the force . Specifically , it authorizes an increase of more than $ 1 billion for science and technology programs that fund cutting-edge research and prototyping activities at universities , small businesses , defense labs , and industry , including in critical areas such as artificial intelligence , microelectronics , advanced materials , 5G , and biotechnology . The bill also authorizes an increase of more than $ 500 million in funding for DARPA , the Defense Advanced Projects Agency . DARPA has been conducting high-risk , high-payoff research for years , including such areas as quantum computing and assisting with universities to accelerate their research . Importantly , the implements a number of recommendations from the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence , which the Armed Services Committee established in a previous NDAA . The $ 500 million of funding for DARPA will be extremely critical to the future and will produce , I think , some breakthrough technologies that not only DOD will use but will become commercial products for our national economy . And recognizing , again , the competition between the United States and China on certain militarily-relevant technologies , the bill strengthens the language of the CHIPS Act to ensure the national network for microelectronics research and development to support the development of world-leading domestic microelectronics technology and manufacturing capabilities . Now , I mentioned one of our problems is that we are moving from an industrial age , in which we were the dominant power in every dimension , to a new post-industrial age , where technological innovation has been distributed . Other countries , because of the [ [ Page S8414 ] ] nature of cyber and other technologies , are beginning to catch up with it and , in some cases , pass us . Often , and especially in the Department of Defense , one of our problems has been procurement and acquisition practices . '\n",
    "rawjr7 = ' The approach of the department has been convoluted , poorly communicated , and burdened with inertia that makes partnering with private industry far too difficult . As America confronts threats around the globe that are evolving at unprecedented speeds , we must find a better way to identify our defense needs , communicate them , and deliver them in a timely manner . There are several areas that , if transformed , could allow DOD to more effectively do this . The fiscal year 2022 NDAA makes important progress by establishing an independent commission to review and assess the planning , programming , budgeting , and execution -- or PPBE -- process and identify areas for reform . The PPBE process has , for many decades , since the 1960s , given DOD leaders a way to evaluate the resources they need and to deliver them to the troops . However , as I mention consistently , it is a bit of a relic of the industrial age . It came in 1961 under Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara , the former chief executive of the Ford Company . And at that time , it was the most sophisticated way to manage resources and do research , but that was the height of the industrial age . We are now in a situation much different . So we need to modernize the procurement system and the acquisition system that we have in place . We have to make it more rapid , more agile , more capable of absorbing new products and getting them into the hands of the troops . So in addition to establishing this independent review commission , the NDAA requires the DOD Comptroller , along with the Chief Information Officer of the DoD and the Chief Data Officer , to submit a plan to consolidate the IT systems used to manage data and support the PPBE process . One of the things we have discovered is there is no really integrated data plan in the Department of Defense -- the largest Federal entity . There are multiple different brands of software systems , different brand of hardware . Some can talk to others , some cannot . There is no successful company today that has such a , shall we say , slightly immature information processing system , and we have got to change it . Similarly , management transformation is badly needed with the Department . As I said , it is one of the largest bureaucracies in the world , and the Government Accountability Office has put the Pentagon approach to business management on its high-risk list , citing its vulnerability to waste , fraud , and abuse , inability to pass a financial audit , and a culture that remains resistant to change . To spur transformation , this NDAA requires the Secretary of Defense to improve Pentagon management by leveraging best practices and expertise from commercial industry , public administration , and business schools . I am confident these steps will allow us to leverage the best of American ingenuity and market talent that drives innovation . At the end of the day , we should think about management as a defense capability like any other . We hope we are opening up a new day of more efficient and sophisticated management , more integrated communication , and doing it in a way that will produce results that will get the best technology into the hands of our fighting men and women . One factor that we all are aware of every day is the challenge of cyber security . The cyber domain impacts everything we do , so there is absolutely no surprise that it has impacted the Defense Department and its industrial base . We need to ensure that our industrial base has improved cyber security , that they are not the back door through which our adversaries will use to enter and gain access to even more critical elements of our national security . As the recent SolarWinds , Microsoft Exchange Server , and Colonial Pipeline breaches painfully illustrated , traditional `` perimeter-based '' cyber defenses are simply inadequate to deal with sophisticated threats . Our adversaries are clearly advantaged in cyber domain and are likely to succeed in penetrating static defenses . Therefore , this NDAA requires the development of a joint `` zero trust '' cyber security strategy and a model architecture for the Department of Defense information network . It also authorizes an increase of $ 268.4 million across DOD to support cyber security efforts . We all recognize that cyber is a persistent threat to everything we do . As one very thoughtful gentleman said years ago at a function I was at , `` Breakthrough technology like cyber has two effects . It makes good things better and bad things worse . '' And that is exactly what we are witnessing every day . So we have to exploit the good things and get them into our system and be much more vigilant at protecting us from the bad things . Similarly , as the COVID crisis has made clear , we need a coordinated industrial policy to ensure that we have a robust , secure , and reliable technology and industrial base , especially in critical and emerging technology . We need to give the DOD the tools and expertise to understand its supply chain and its physical security challenges , its financial challenges , and influence from commercial market trends . To that end , this bill directs the Comptroller General to conduct a comprehensive assessment of research , development , test , and evaluation authorities and other similar authorities and brief Congress on its findings . The pandemic has shown many interesting things . Many companies and suppliers to our defense thought their products were coming from the United States , only to discover that critical components came from elsewhere and sometimes countries that were not particularly friendly to us . So we have to look seriously at our supply chain . Finally , while I spent most of my time speaking about future challenges and how we prepare the Department of Defense to face them , we can not lose sight of the events surrounding our withdrawal from Afghanistan . After nearly 20 years of war , enormous sacrifice by American and coalition military , diplomatic , and intelligence personnel and vast U.S. investment , the Afghan state has failed , and the Taliban has taken control . The Armed Services Committee has undertaken a series of hearings seeking to understand the collapse of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces . While there is temptation to close the book on Afghanistan and simply move on to long-term strategic competition with China and Russia , we must learn the lessons of the last two decades to ensure that our future counterterrorism efforts in Afghanistan or anyplace else continue to hold violent extremists at bay . The top-line defense number in this bill , together with the allocations set by Chairman Leahy for defense and nondefense funding across the 12 appropriations bills , provides a realistic balance for funding the military and the rest of the Federal Government . Once we have completed work on this important authorization bill , we need to complete the appropriations process . It would be a tremendous mistake and harmful for our national security , our economic prosperity , and our public health to resort to a continuing resolution to fund the government for an extensive period . I have calculated , roughly , that if we go into a yearlong continuing resolution , the Department of Defense will lose $ 36 billion , and the consequences of that would be staggering , particularly at this moment where we face challenges across the globe . We have near-peer competition with Russia and China , dangerous developments in East Africa , and situations across the board where we need to be ready to go looking at the threats , not looking internally at how we are going to pay to keep the lights on . Again , to avoid this self-inflicted damage , we have to pass a budget , as well as this authorization bill . Let me conclude by once again thanking Ranking Member Inhofe and my colleagues on the committee for working thoughtfully on a bipartisan basis to develop this important piece of legislation . I would also like to thank the staff who worked tirelessly on this bill throughout the year -- and tirelessly is an understatement . While we were leaving after our last vote , they were staying hours later to get this bill in shape to pass and then to begin our dialogue with the House . It is the staff of both sides . I salute the staffers of my Republican [ [ Page S8415 ] ] colleagues and my staffers for their job . I look forward to a thoughtful debate on the issues as we go forward . I yield the floor . I suggest the absence of a quorum .'\n",
    "rawjr8 = 'Mr. President , I rise to express my support for the fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act . I am pleased , as we all are , that we will be voting soon on passage . I would like to thank Ranking Member Inhofe for his leadership and his thoughtfulness on this bill . He has been an excellent partner throughout this whole process . Our Nation faces an enormous range of security challenges , and it is more important than ever that we provide our military men and women with the support they need to keep Americans safe . To that end , this bill makes great progress . It addresses a broad range of pressing issues , from strategic competition with China and Russia , to disruptive technologies like hypersonics , AI , and quantum computing , to modernizing our ships , aircraft , and vehicles . It provides our servicemembers with the resources and support they need to defend our Nation , while at the same taking care of their families . Importantly , this bill authorizes a well-deserved 2.7-percent pay raise for both military members and the DOD civilian workforce . It also increases parental leave to 12 weeks for all servicemembers and creates a new 2-week bereavement leave benefit for both military and Federal civilian employees . I want to especially note that this bill includes historic , sweeping reforms to the Uniform Code of Military Justice and how the military investigates and prosecutes sexual assault and other offenses , including murder , manslaughter , kidnapping , and many other crimes . Just as my Senate colleagues , the Independent Review Commission of the President, and survivors advocate groups have called for , this bill takes prosecutorial power away from the chain of command for these cases . Our bill creates `` special trial counsel , '' highly specialized prosecutors who will have exclusive , binding , and final decision-making authority over whether to prosecute these offenses . This is a sea change for the military justice system , and I am grateful to my colleagues in both Chambers and on both sides of the aisle for working together to achieve this historic reform for the well-being of our military women and men . Indeed , we listened to survivors , advocates , and experts because we owe it to our servicemembers to get this policy right . The world is as dangerous and complex as it has ever been . We depend on the military to answer the call in these challenging times , and we owe it to them to ensure the policies we enact on this matter and others preserves the military power of this Nation and cohesion . I respect those who might see this matter differently , but this bill makes our country and our troops more secure because we listened to advocates and experts to reach a compromise with the House of Representatives . The defense bill of this year also makes excellent progress toward meeting the challenges of long-term strategic competition with China and Russia . It invests in the people , platforms , infrastructure , and game- changing technologies that will define the future . It extends and modifies the Pacific Deterrence Initiative , or PDI , and reiterates the intent of the Senate to improve our force posture in the Indo-Pacific , increase readiness and presence , and build the capabilities of our partners and allies to counter the increasing aggression of China . Similarly , the bill of this year authorizes the continuation of the European Deterrence Initiative , or EDI , in recognition of the vital need to support our allies and partners in Europe as we work toward the shared goals of deterring Russian aggression , addressing strategic competition , and mitigating shared security concerns . With respect to our services , we have taken steps to improve their capabilities and their ability to fight and win . Across the Army , Navy , Air Force , Marine Corps , and Space Force , this bill makes significant efforts to improve the readiness of our aircraft , ships , vehicles , missiles , and weapons systems . It authorizes significant increases in military construction projects , modernizing our nuclear triad and missile defense systems , and investing in cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence , microelectronics , advanced materials , 5G , and biotechnology . And with regard to our withdrawal from Afghanistan , we must capture the lessons of the last two decades to ensure that our future counterterrorism efforts in Afghanistan and elsewhere continue to hold violent extremists at bay . To that end , I am pleased that this bill includes the Afghanistan War Commission Act , an amendment spearheaded by Senator Duckworth . This bill was originally crafted by the Armed Services Committee after a series of thoughtful hearings , discussions , and debates on both sides of the aisle . Through the committee markup process , we considered more than 300 amendments and ultimately adopted 143 amendments . Senator Inhofe and I introduced this bill to the full Senate with the intent of adding more amendments on the floor . Although we were not able to come to an agreement to debate and vote on several amendments on the floor , we were ultimately able to adopt amendments from Senators on both sides of the aisle in the final legislation . Over the past several weeks , the Senate and House Armed Services Committees have worked around the clock to come to an agreement on this final version of this bill . I am proud of the improvements we made throughout this process , and I was pleased to see the House vote last week in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion , 363 to 70 , to pass the bill . We have produced a strong NDAA that both parties and both chambers can support , and the President will be able to sign . I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the phenomenal staff who have made this bill possible . I want to specifically recognize the director for the Democratic staff , Elizabeth King , and the director for the Republican staff , John Wason . They have led their staffs and collaborated admirably with bipartisanship , diligence , and utmost professionalism . I would also like to thank members of the Armed Services Committee staff : Jody Bennett , Carolyn Chuhta , Jon Clark , Jenny Davis , Jonathan Epstein , Jorie Feldman , Creighton Greene , Gary Leeling , Kirk McConnell , Maggie McNamara Cooper , Bill Monahan , Mike Noblet , John Quirk , Andy Scott , Arun Seraphin , Cole Stevens , Soleil Sykes , Keri Lyn Michalke , Hailey Becker , Patrick Shilo , Alison Warner , Leah Brewer , Debbie Chiarello , Joe Gallo , [ [ Page S9175 ] ] Leslie Ashton , Cami Pease , Brittany Amador , Griffin Cannon , Nate Green , Brandon Kasprick , Sofia Kamali , Tom Maggiacomo , and , once again , staff director Elizabeth King . From my personal office , I would like to thank Neil Campbell and Elyse Wasch . Also , let me thank the floor staff and the leadership staff . Gary Myrick , Tricia Engle , Dan Tinsley , Brad Watt , Stephanie Paone , Nate Oursler , Rachel Jackson , and Liza Patterson . You have been part of this process for the last several weeks , and you have done a remarkable job . We thank you for that very , very much . I would like to thank Senator Inhofe again for his partnership throughout this process , and I would thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers from the House Armed Services Committee for their collaboration as well . Finally , I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this excellent bill . I yield the floor . '\n",

    "raw00 = 'Adam SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R . 4350 . The SPEAKER pro tempore . Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington ? There was no objection . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield myself 4 minutes . Madam Speaker , we have before us the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 , and I highly recommend it to the Members of the House and urge everybody to support this incredibly important and very well put together piece of legislation . [ [ Page H4794 ] ] The first thing I will say is thank you to all of the staff , certainly on the Armed Services Committee , but the Rules Committee as well , and the leadership staff . This has been a truly bipartisan legislative process . We had our markup in committee which lasted , I will do a little quick math in my head , something like 16 hours . We considered over 800 amendments , with a variety of different variations , and we got that number up closer to 1100 . And then before the Rules Committee there were , again , over 800 amendments submitted , and we have worked with Members of this body , Democrats and Republicans , members on the committee and off , to craft what I think is a very good piece of legislation . I think it is incredibly important , first of all , that we pass this bill so that Congress continues to exercise its authority to exercise oversight over the Department of Defense . I know Members on both sides of this aisle have lamented throughout the years the degree to which the executive branch has exerted more power over the years , where the legislative branch has exhibited less . Now , granted , you find that issue more troubling when the opposite party is in charge of the White House , but we are all troubled by that phenomena . We need to exercise our authority ; this bill does that . To my mind , Congress does not pass enough authorizing bills , but we do do so in the Department of Defense , and have done so for over 60 straight years , and should do so again . This bill , I think , is particularly important because we are at an important moment in defense of this country and in dealing with our role in the world . We have never faced a more complex threat environment . We have threats from Russia , China , Iran , North Korea , and transnational terrorist groups . In addition , we are now coming out of 20 years of war fought in Iraq and Afghanistan , both countries of which our military now is out and not fighting those wars , and we have a whole bunch of change to deal with . At the same time , innovation has never been more important in properly defending this country . We need to update and modernize our armed forces , everything from our information systems , to our command and control , to our platforms , to the support we give to our servicemembers . I am very proud that this bill reflects those priorities . And the work has been done between Mr. Rogers and myself and members of the committee to produce that product . And I want to take a moment here to thank Mr. Rogers , the ranking member , he has been a terrific partner in this process , as has his staff and as has his members . I think this bill reflects those priorities . It figures out how to improve our ability to update the military more quickly , to better buy software , to better innovate , to better embrace the innovative technologies that we need . Madam Speaker , I want to particularly thank Mr. Langevin , as the subcommittee chair , who has taken the lead on the AI task force that looks at this question in great specificity . This bill really puts us in a position to modernize the force as we need to . One other crucial issue that we do in this is we address the issue of sexual assault in the military that continues to be a scourge upon service in the military . We have worked for years to try to address this issue , we have not been successful . This year , thanks in large part to the leadership of Congresswoman Speier , we have updated the UCMJ to create a special prosecutor for victims to give sexual assault and sex crimes the attention they deserve to make sure that we are protecting the men and women who serve in the military . It is a crucial aspect of this bill , and I strongly urge Members to support it . Lastly , let me just say that as you pore over this bill , everybody here will find something that they do not like . Everybody here will also find something that they wish was in there that is not . There is no doubt about that , because it is a very large bill , and it was a collaborative process . But it is the nature of the legislative process that you do not get absolutely everything that you want . I hope Members will keep that in mind . But it is also the nature of the legislative process , in this case , that we have produced a product that everybody in this House can be proud of . And , again , I want to thank my Republican counterpart . We have worked together to produce this . I urge support from all Members . This is a bill every Member , Democrat and Republican , can enthusiastically support , and I reserve the balance of my time .'\n",
    "raws2 = 'Madam Speaker , I yield myself 1,5 minutes just to address a couple things the gentleman from Virginia said . I want to be clear , it is the longstanding practice of our committee that we take issues that are not in our jurisdiction . We have done it under Republican leadership . We have done it under Democratic leadership . It is also the longstanding practice of our committee to work with the committees of jurisdiction , and only if in a bipartisan , bicameral way those committees of jurisdiction agree , does it ultimately go into the conference report . So you do not need to be afraid of stuff that you do not like . Work with [ [ Page H4802 ] ] your committees of jurisdiction and it goes into the conference report if we get agreement . If it does not , it does not . Second , last year that is not what held us up . The two things that held us up last year were one thing that was very much within the jurisdiction of this committee , and that was whether or not to rename military bases ; to change the names of the bases named for Confederates , very much in our jurisdiction . And the second thing was the last-second desire of President Trumo , out of nowhere , to add section 230 to the bill . We were not held up by these things , and we will not be held up this year . If the committees of jurisdiction do not agree , we do not do it . We just have that negotiation . If they can , we give them a ride . So do not need to worry about that . It is a good bill . Go ahead and vote for it . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California ( Ms. Speier ) , the chairwoman of the Military Personnel Subcommittee .'\n",
    "raws3 = 'Madam Speaker , I yield myself the balance of my time . I just want to agree with Mr. Rogers . This bill , as you can hear from the Members speaking in favor of it on both sides of the aisle , encompasses a lot of different provisions , all designed to make sure we can adequately defend the country ; and , most importantly , designed to make sure that we protect the men and women who are serving us to protect that country . There are a lot of provisions in this bill focused on improving the quality of life , including a 2.7 percent pay increase and significant increases to improve things like childcare centers and barracks across the country . I think this bill does an excellent job of identifying the threats that we face and putting ourselves in the best possible position to meet those threats going forward . Again , no bill is perfect . We disagree on things . Everyone will have something in here that they wish were slightly different , but overall , I think we can support this bill . I do want to close by once again emphasizing , I know there is a lot of angst about the amendments that have been ruled in order ; but , again , that is not unusual that we would deal with issues that are not necessarily directly within our jurisdiction . We work with the committees of jurisdiction in order to carry those bills . We will continue to work on that . I can say with confidence that there is no amendment that has been ruled in order that we are going to debate on that should impact any Members voting for this bill . This is a very strong bill . Do not forget the underlying provisions in this bill that are so important to the men and women who are serving this country , to the protections they need , the protections they deserve , and the protections that it is our obligation to provide for them and which I feel very , very strongly that this bill does . This bill deserves support from this committee . I urge a `` yes '' vote . Madam Speaker , I yield back the balance of my time .'\n",
    "raws4 = 'Madam Speaker , first of all , I want to thank all the people involved in this [ [ Page H7216 ] ] process . Certainly , the staff of the Armed Services Committee , our bipartisan staff , worked incredibly hard over the course of this year to put the bill together , first to get it through our committee process , off the floor and then in the negotiation process that has led to this final bill . I think it is an incredibly important process because it includes so many people . Throughout the House , throughout the Senate , Members who have concerns in a wide range of policy areas have the opportunity in this bill to have those concerns heard and to try to address them through legislation . When you add it all up , of all the different proposals that have come at us in the House and the Senate negotiating process , you are well north of a thousand different ideas that have been sent our way , and the staff sift through all of that , working with Members and their staffs as well , to try to come up with the best solutions . This is an unbelievably important process because it is representative democracy . It is the way our system is supposed to work , and this bill truly reflects that . It is a bipartisan , bicameral product that took into account every single opinion that it could , and I think we have produced an outstanding product . The number one thing that I want to make sure that people are aware of is how important the Armed Services Committees job of exercising oversight of the Department of Defense is and how important our job of making sure that the men and women who serve our country have everything they need to carry out the missions that we ask them to do . That is what our committee does . A whole lot of other issues get involved , but at its core , that is what we are focused on . In this bill there are hundreds of provisions to help make sure that gets done and gets done well . One of the major challenges our military faces right now is dealing with the rapid pace of technology . It is getting the Pentagon to better and more quickly adapt the innovative technologies that we need to meet our national security threats , and those threats are very real , as we are learning right now in real time , with what is going on between Russia and Ukraine , as we learn every day as we deal with an expansionist China , as we try to deal with Iran and North Korea and transnational terrorist groups . Those threats are real . Technology and innovation are crucial to meeting those threats , but we are moving too slowly at this point . There was a commission on artificial intelligence run by Eric Schmidt and Bob Work that put a whole series of recommendations together . Jim Langevins subcommittee worked on that . A number of proposals are in this bill to help them do a better job of handling that issue . We had a task force last year on supply chain concerns , which we have heard so much about . A number of key provisions from that task force are in this bill . That is what we do . Now , there are a lot of other issues , and it seems like when we get down to the end , we are always talking about the things we disagree about , which makes a certain amount of sense because , you know , you get through the stuff you can agree on , then you get down to the tougher stuff , and then you get down to the really tough stuff . But when we get down to that really tough stuff , I really hope that people do not lose track of how important this piece of legislation is with the day in and day out work we do to support the national security and national defense of this country and to support the people who we ask to perform those tasks . This is an outstanding bill that needs to get passed . Now , it also happens that it is one of the few bills that consistently passes every year . Well , actually , it is the only bill that consistently gets passed every year , so we have a lot of issues from outside committees . I forget how many hundreds of proposals we had , but at the end of the day , the hundred-plus proposals that were in this bill we got 40 percent of them included in the final product , and we are happy to do that because it helps advance important issues in a wide variety of other areas . We ca not carry them all because you have got to get bipartisan , bicameral agreement . So those of you who did not get what you wanted out of this , please look at what is in the bill and how important it is . And the single most important thing in this bill , in my view , is we finally reformed our Uniform Code of Military Justice for how it deals with sexual assault . A stain on the military to this day is the fact that we have not adequately dealt with and protected the servicemembers who have faced sexual crimes in the military . This is the most transformational change that we have done on that issue . We take all sex crimes away from the commander , and we create a Special Victims Prosecutor who will have the expertise , the commitment , and the focus to adequately decide what crimes should be charged and to prosecute those crimes effectively . Now , a lot of people have worked on this . Nobody has done more than Jackie Speier . Jackie is responsible for getting this done and getting it to this point . Of all those people who worked on it , there were a lot of differences of opinion about how exactly to do it . And I know some folks think it should have been done slightly differently here , slightly differently there . This is the agreement that we can get done and get passed , and it is transformational in what it does . It is also , I believe , crucial to dealing with one of the other major issues that we face in the military , and that is diversity . '\n",
    "raws5 = 'The diversity problem that we have with recruitment , promotion , and how is the UCMJ carried out with regard to people of color . This bill will give us the opportunity to set up a whole set of crimes that are under a new authority to take a shot at fixing that problem . Now , I know some would like to add more crimes to that , and we had that debate . This is what we came up with , and it is huge . It is the biggest change we have had in a long time . It is worthy of our support . The entire bill is worthy of our support . The last thing I want to say is , I want to specifically thank Mr. Rogers of Alabama , the ranking member on this committee . The bipartisan , bicameral work that we do would not be possible without leadership on both sides . I could not ask for a better partner . His staff has been outstanding , as well as we have worked to get this product . I highly recommend this bill . Madam Speaker , I urge everyone to vote in favor of this bill , and I reserve the balance of my time .'\n",
    "raws6 = 'Madam Speaker , I yield myself the balance of my time . Madam Speaker , I want to begin at an odd place . I do not want to discourage people from voting for this bill , but on the vaccine mandate issue , I want to make very clear that I heard a lot of things that were supposed to be done in this bill ; none of that was done in the bill . We do not have anything in the bill which tells the military what they can or can not do in terms of punishing people for refusing to meet the vaccine mandate , as a starting point . We certainly do not have anything in the bill that says natural immunity can count . We do have language in the bill that says that the military should take a look at how the vaccine mandate could be -- sorry . It is not in the bill ; it is in bill language , which is a different thing . It says you can look at how the vaccine mandate is affecting recruitment and retention , and that is fine . But all that other stuff , Madam Speaker , for those of you who are listening and thinking I may have lost my mind , I have not . We did not support that and did not do that . That minor point aside , this is an outstanding piece of legislation that is truly bipartisan . There are a lot of small , little things here and there . But , again , the big picture is everything we do in this bill and everything that you heard , Madam Speaker , from primarily the chairs and ranking members of our subcommittee , an exhaustive list of all the provisions that are so important in making sure that we meet our obligations on national security , defense , and supporting the men and women who serve . It is a ton of work to figure out those policies , and it has never been , in my view , more important during my time in Congress . As we have heard , we have these threats that are out there . They are real and as complex as they have ever been . Then also , we have the rapid pace of technology and innovation that is changing what is necessary to provide adequate deterrence and to provide adequate defense on a minute-to-minute basis . The most crucial thing in our ability to meet our national security objectives is : How quickly are we going to innovate ? How quickly are we going to adapt ? We are not innovating and adapting quickly enough right now , and there are a whole bunch of provisions in this bill to help push the Pentagon in the correct direction , to help make sure we give them the help they need or , in some cases , the push they need to adopt the technology that is going to move us in a better direction . We also have a lot in this bill to help improve competition and to deal with some of the very painful cost overruns that we have seen on programs like the KC-46 tanker , programs like the F-35 , and a whole series of other issues . We introduce competition , and we introduce ways to make sure that we take advantage of technology because every time I see a cost overrun -- and the Speaker is uniquely positioned to understand this . Again , we have these terrible cost overruns we hear about , and we always hear : Oh , well , it is a software problem . Well , yes , it is like a multibillion-dollar software problem . So why do not we fix those software problems and save us a lot of money ? This bill pushes us more in the direction of getting after those problems than any bill that I have worked on . It is an incredibly important piece of legislation that moves us forward in a positive direction . Yes , we are also able to carry a few issues that were not in our jurisdiction . In fact , Madam Speaker , with the permission of everyone , the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee has arrived and was going to speak . Madam Speaker , if I could yield to him just 1 minute or 2 to talk about the Committee on Foreign Affairs because the committee reauthorized a provision that is contained in this bill as well . I want to make sure the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee has at least a couple of minutes . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes of my remaining time to the gentleman from New York ( Mr. Meeks ) to talk about the Foreign Affairs provision , and then I will close when he is done . Madam Speaker , I want to start by thanking the staff for the outstanding job that they do . As I have always said , Members have constituents coming at us on a variety of different issues . We come up with ideas and say we ought to do this . And from that , that idea actually has to be written down and has to get approval . It is the staff that does all [ [ Page H7222 ] ] that tireless work to make sure that we get the final product that is in front of us . I really , really want to thank the staff . I want to emphasize the fact that our staff on the Armed Services Committee is a bipartisan staff . It is the only committee in Congress that does that . Whether we are in charge or the Republicans are in charge , the staff is bipartisan , and I think that is incredibly important in getting the work done in the way that we do , working together to produce this product . This is a product every single Member of this body can be proud of , and it is a product I think every single Member of this body should vote for . Madam Speaker , I urge passage , and I yield back the balance of my time .'\n",

    "rawrj = 'Ronny JACKSON . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of my amendment , which clearly states that Israel is a critical defense partner of ours . Our national security is inextricably linked to our relationship with and the support of our military for Israel . As our strongest ally in the Middle East , it is critical that we conduct military exercises with Israel to improve interoperability and readiness . We must ensure that Israel has the capabilities it needs to defend itself against terrorists with consistent and reliable transfers of defense articles . Last year , President Trump negotiated the historic Abraham Accords , and to honor that , my amendment states clear support for Israelian work to promote peace . While some in this body have made their disdain for the Jewish State of Israel clear , I believe our relationship with Israel is nonnegotiable . Our friends in Israel are currently questioning our commitment because some of my more radical colleagues forced the Speaker to withdraw financial support for the Iron Dome yesterday . I urge all Members of this body to support my amendment . We must take this step to show the only democracy in the Middle East that they can count on us for support .'\n",

For the 13th District of Texas , this bill will protect the nuclear triad , it will modernize the Pantex Plant in Amarillo , and it will support training done at Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita Falls . It also included provisions that I authored to put servicemembers first and ensure the safety of all of our soldiers , sailors , airmen , marines , and guardians . This NDAA also pushes back on the unconstitutional vaccine mandate , and it holds the Biden administration accountable for its failed Afghanistan withdrawal . Just as important , there are some notable provisions that are not included .

    "rawmg = 'Mike GARCIA of California . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of my critical , bipartisan , bicameral bill , the Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act , which was included as an amendment in this en bloc package . My amendment would support military families by allowing military spouses with valid professional licenses in one State reciprocity in another State where their spouse is stationed on military orders . This effectively allows the spouse to cross-deck their professional license to another State while their spouse is on Active Duty . More than 30 percent of our military spouses work in a field requiring professional licensing , and when these families receive move orders to a new State , military spouses often must spend time and money to reapply for a professional license that they already have . On average , military families lose thousands of dollars per move in lost wages and fees caused by relicensing barriers , and in many cases the spouse ends up not even applying for the license because it takes too long or is too costly to do so . The struggle often threatens the economic security and quality of life for these families , as their loved ones serve our Nation . No military spouse should have to decide between job security and being with their family . Military families already sacrifice so much in service to our great country , and we must work to protect these families . At a time in which our communities are also facing critical shortages of skilled professionals , like nurses and teachers , I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment that will drastically improve the quality of life for our military families as well as our communities .'\n",

A lot of this technology that we are investing in is developed , built , and tested in my district , the 25th Congressional District . This removes red flag provisions . It allows for those who do not want to get vaccinated to be separated from the service with an honorable discharge . Clearly , I support this bill and it is an excellent NDAA . I do think we need to do better when it comes to the base pay of our troops. Some may tout the 2.7 percent pay increase . I see it as anemic , frankly , and it is actually aggravating the pay gap between military servicemembers and their civilian counterparts . With record inflation , our troops , especially the junior enlisted , continue to be hammered financially . If we want to deter threats and win wars in the modern battlefield , which we have to , we need to attract and retain more talent . If we want to end things like conscription , and we should , we need to better incentivize our enlisted ranks to join and stay in . I urge support .'\n",

This bill includes three amendments that were submitted by my office that will directly benefit the security of our nation and , of course , the people of Puerto Rico . The first one is amendment 162 , which authorizes research into the health effects of nearly 70 years of live fire training in the municipality of Vieques . As well , amendment 163 supports the Puerto Rico National Guard by prohibiting the retirement of the current landing craft ships , or the MAG boats , not only used in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2019 and that were used again in March of this year . The Puerto Rico National Guard has used these ships to provide lifesaving food , water , and other equipment to the U.S. Virgin Islands , Vieques , and Culebra after any natural disaster . We can not afford to retire these ships until they are replaced . Lastly , will be amendment 164 , which requires the Secretary of the Army to allocate a Modular Small Arms Range to Puerto Rico . This is to increase the readiness of the Armed Forces . Right now , Puerto Rico only has a single firearms range for the Department of Defense personnel . That means that there are numerous scheduling conflicts , and it decreases the mission readiness on the island . I think those amendments should be supported . I want to thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers ; I really appreciate all their good work on this NDAA . Included in this en bloc are numerous provisions for the people of Puerto Rico as a territory . '\n",
    "rawjgc2 = 'Mr. Speaker , I rise in strong support of en bloc package number two for the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022 . This bill includes three amendments that were submitted by my office and will directly benefit the people of Puerto Rico and the securityof our nation . Amendment 162 requires the Secretary of Defense to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences for the purpose of investigating the health effects on the island Municipality of Vieques that may have been [ [ Page H4989 ] ] caused by toxic waste left after nearly 70 years of live fire training . This waste includes heavy metals like lead , cancer-causing fuel chemicals , and even depleted uranium . In some locations , areas are so contaminated that it is not safe for workers to collect samples . While there are numerous studies from different government agencies on this topic , including from the Centers for Disease Control and Government Accountability Office , much work remains to be done to further understand the consequences from this practice . I am proud to say that this legislation now builds upon existing research for this important topic . Amendment number 163 prohibits the Secretary of Defense from retiring the Landing Craft ships used by Puerto Ricos Army National Guard until such time as an adequate replacement is provided . These ships delivered critical food , water , and other materials to Puerto Ricos noncontiguous islands of Vieques and Culebra , as well as the US Virgin Islands , following the aftermath of Hurricane Maria . The landing craft ships were scheduled to be retired this year , however the adopted amendment prohibits this decommissioning until replacement equipment arrives to Puerto Rico . My third and last amendment , number 164 , requires the Secretary of the Army to allocate a Modular Small Arms Range to Puerto Rico . Currently , Puerto Rico only has a single firearms range for Department of Defense personnel . This creates numerous scheduling conflicts and decreases mission readiness . Puerto Ricos own Fort Buchanan has the capacity to support a Modular Small Arms Range . My office has met with both Army leaders who support this request . Let me close by noting that H.R . 4350 includes funding over 12 million dollars in funding for Fort Allen and 10 million for the Ramey Unit School , under the energy resilience and conservation program . Finally , H.R . 4350 includes 14 million under military construction for Fort Buchanan in Puerto Rico . I am appreciative of the Armed Service committees work and I look forward to seeing these projects to completion . I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of en bloc number two . '\n",

    "rawtt = 'Tommy TUBERVILLE . Madam President , after being in Washington , DC , for 10 months , I have seen this town jump from one issue to another . Sadly , many of the issues we face are self-inflicted -- illegal immigrants on the southern border , Americans who remain trapped in Afghanistan , and rampant inflation , just to name three . But we face a more serious threat in this Nation , an issue larger than left or right , a threat that goes beyond conservative and liberal -- China . China seeks to shackle the United States economically , technologically , and militarily . The Communist leaders of China are employing every instrument of national power to diminish our standing and influence in the world . Last month , President Biden told world leaders during his maiden U.N. General Assembly speech that the United States `` is not seeking a cold war . '' Well , the United States may not be seeking out a new Cold War , but China is , so we should not give them the shovel to bury us . When asked this week if the hypersonic missile testing of China over the summer was a surprise to U.S. officials , White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki joked that the Biden administration `` welcomes stiff competition . '' Businesses that are struggling under unfair competition from China did not laugh at the joke of the Press Secretary. Intelligence analysts who watch week after week as China hacks its way to technological superiority know the competition is cheating . Military leaders who stand the watch for us worry that the United States public may be asleep at the wheel to this enormous threat . In 2001 , then-Senator Biden said : The United States welcomes the emergence of a prosperous integrated China on the global stage because we expect this is going to be a China that plays by the rules . President Biden , China is not playing by the rules . The Director of National Intelligence , Avril Haines , said the following in her Annual Threat Assessment : The Chinese Communist Party . . . will continue . . . to . . . undercut . . . the United States , drive wedges between Washington and its allies and partners , and foster . . . international norms that favor the authoritarian Chinese system . The four-star admiral in charge of our nuclear overwatch , ADM Charles Richard , warned the country that Chinese growth and strategic nuclear capability was `` breathtaking . '' To those paying attention , we know that China seeks to play a very dangerous game -- a game they intend to win and a game they will win unless we stand united as a nation and work together to face this growing threat . So let us take a look at the most recent breathtaking development . China recently conducted their ninth hypersonic missile test since 2014 -- their ninth . By the way , 2014 was when then-President Obama was forced to start investing in missile defense after he ended or slowed funding for several programs early in his first term . What was important about the most recent test of China , however , is that it showed off Chinese advanced space capabilities . Hypersonic missiles are weapons that fly at more than five times the speed of sound , 3,800 miles per hour . They do not follow a fixed trajectory ; their path is flexible and maneuverable . This is what makes them so hard to defend against . A recent congressional report on hypersonic weapons revealed that the United States will not have a defensive capability against hypersonic weapons until the mid-2020s at the earliest . Unlike our government , which , by the way , is wasting money on civilian climate corps and bailing out poorly run liberal blue States , China spends its resources on deadliness -- a new and larger navy , a modernized nuclear arsenal , advanced space assets , and artificial intelligence . Yes , China is moving ahead and investing in killing machines . Developing hypersonics is costly . The Pentagon noted as much recently , which is ironic given how little this administration has showed it cares about throwing trillions of dollars around on other programs not related to national security . China continues to outspend us on national security . In just the last 10 years , Chinese defense spending has increased by $ 200 billion , while we , the United States of America , have decreased by $ 400 billion . That brings me to a very important point . Senator Schumer needs to bring up the National Defense Authorization Act for a vote here on the Senate floor . Every year since 1960 , we have passed the National Defense Authorization Act , better known as the NDAA . The NDAA is one of few bills that the House and Senate , Democrats and Republicans , work together on . That is because our military deserves it , and our national security depends on it . One of the most important items we agreed on this year in the NDAA was that our military needs more support . Earlier this year , President Biden sent Congress a laughable military budget . In a stunning referendum on the disappointing and dangerous military budget of the President , Democrats and Republicans on the Armed Services Committee came together to increase our military budget by $ 25 billion . You know , we can not ask our military to do more with less . We can not expect our military to defend new threats from our adversaries like China without the resources required to do the job . Republicans understand this . We have continuously fought to prioritize national security . Democrats on the Armed Services Committee also understand this . So I would like to ask [ [ Page S7331 ] ] a simple question : What are we waiting for ? The best way to thank our men and women in uniform for their service is to pass this bill . The best way to ensure our armed services have resources they need to defend our country against China is to pass this bill , especially in light of the news we have seen recently about Chinese hypersonic missile testing . Earlier this year , as the Senate Armed Services Committee crafted the NDAA , I fought to prioritize robust funding authorization for high- energy lasers and hypersonic missile development . This investment accelerates the timeline of the country to a fully capable hypersonic missile while at the same time assisting our missile defense capabilities with tracking hypersonic , ballistic , and cruise missiles . This is an offensive and defensive approach . China is actively trying to outpace us , and keeping pace is not enough . To do that , we need to have sustained , strategic investment in our military . That is what the NDAA provides and why we need a vote on the Senate floor . So what does it say about the priorities of Leader Schumer that passing our military authorization is at the bottom of his list ? But investment in their military is not the only means by which China is seeking to get ahead . We have seen increased efforts by China to infiltrate our economy -- we have seen this -- to undermine our free market values , and to steal our international property . In a recent survey , a greater number of Americans said that China is more powerful economically than the United States . This is a reversal from 2 years ago when most Americans said the United States had the economic upper hand . When it comes to taking over the economic upper hand , China has no rules , and Chinese companies definitely do not play by ours . Our country has already seen Chinese companies , backed by the Chinese Communist Party , attempt to invest in and even take over companies . This grave national security threat will only grow if we allow China to invest in our critical industries . Our government has a process to investigate offers made by foreign companies and governments that want to acquire or invest in America . This process is designed to protect our national security . It is handled by a government entity called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States , better known as CFIUS . But if there is a loophole , communist China will try to slip through it . Our goal as Members of Congress should be to strengthen this vetting process . One way to do that is to add a permanent agricultural perspective to this committee , which is not on there as we speak . The COVID pandemic showed us just how important it is to have strong supply chains , especially when it comes to our food supply . Every American is supported by a safe and secure food supply . It is critical to the prosperity of our country . Not everyone thinks about food security in relation to national security , but they are linked . Global corporations have already become more involved with our domestic food supply and agricultural businesses . Recent data shows that 192,000 acres of farmland or forest in the United States of America are linked to Chinese ownership , including land used for farming , ranching , and forestry -- 192,000 acres here within our borders . That is why we need more transparency . Our food supply must remain secure from foreign governments like China that have no business being in the American economy and actively trying to harm our country . That is why I introduced a bill called the Foreign Adversary Risk Management , or FARM , Act , to put more protections in place for the agriculture industry of Americ. My bill will ensure that our agriculture industry has a permanent seat at the table of CFIUS , which reviews agriculture-related investments . As we speak , we do not have representation from the agriculture community . By adding agriculture supply chains as a covered transaction that CFIUS has to review , we can make sure food supply chains remain strong and free of damaging foreign government interference . Like the communist leaders of , leftists in this country believe that when it comes to the economy , bureaucrats know best . They think raising the corporate rate to be higher than of Communist China will strengthen our economy . Nonsense .' \n",
    "rawtt2 = 'That is like standing in a bucket and trying to lift yourself by the handle . The far-left cheers for mandates , hyperregulation , and massive taxes . They sneer at your freedoms and are triggered by the American flag and our constitutional rights . Their way is not the way to combat China ; it is the way to become China . We all know China wants to overtake the United States as a superpower . But what makes the United States a superpower is not just our economic and military might ; we are a superpower for what our military is fighting to defend and to protect : our freedoms and our values and the American spirit of innovation and ingenuity , of hard work and grit . These values pose a direct threat to communist China . They are why China wants to surpass our country as the  No . 1 superpower of the world . We need leadership that protects our national security and our economic security . It is the only way to combat the aggression that the weakness of the Biden administration has invited . I yield the floor .'\n",
    "rawtt3 = 'Madam President , I spoke recently about how the President  `` skinny '' budget is disappointing , dangerous , and a disservice to our men and women in uniform . China actively seeks to outpace the U.S. military , and in some cases , they are succeeding . This is not a 5- or 10-year problem ; the threat is right now , today . Unfortunately , the military is not the only area facing active challenges by China . Today , I am going to discuss a few at-risk areas that are critical to the stability of our Nation . It is no secret that the Chinese Communist Party , or CCP , wants to replace the United States as the world  top power . The American people need to be aware of how the Chinese Communist Party is coming after us , not just with missiles and military might but with plans to subdue the American spirit . The repressive CCP uses economic espionage to advance its agenda to weaken our arsenal of democracy . A significant part of what has made the United States a global powerhouse is the strength and resilience of our private sector companies . Whether it is in the technology , healthcare , or energy sector , American innovation is unrivaled . It is what has made us the greatest economy in the history of the world . China  leaders know this , but rather than go head-to-head in honest competition , they have settled for stealing our intellectual property . Chinese businesses , at the instruction of their government , lure American companies in . They offer cheap labor . They promise [ [ Page S2537 ] ] an `` exchange of ideas , '' but they really want to steal our valuable intellectual property . As President Trump  Director of National Intelligence , John Ratcliffe , said , China  strategy is to `` rob , replicate and replace . '' China robs American companies of their intellectual property , they replicate our technology , and then China replaces U.S. firms in the global marketplace . This theft is not exclusive to just one industry . They will go after whatever they can to get their hands on it -- wind turbines , airplane designs , underwater drones , chemicals , or artificial intelligence technology . According to the Department of Justice , between 2011 and 2018 , more than 90 percent of the Department  foreign economic espionage cases involved China . By stealing this critical knowledge , the Chinese have given themselves a leg up on other nations . They are using it to expand their military and economic power . Their goal is to surpass the U.S. economy and gain monopoly control over every major industry . We can not allow that to succeed . Even more alarming is what China is doing from within our own universities . The American people may not be familiar with Confucius Institutes , but they should be . Confucius Institutes currently operate at 55 American colleges and universities . While they claim to harmlessly promote Chinese language and culture , they actually serve as a beachhead for the Chinese Government within America  research institutions . Often , just the presence of a Confucius Institute on campus will enable Chinese officials to stifle any criticism of the Chinese Government at that university . The institutes also allow the Chinese Government to harvest valuable data from research being conducted at our country  world-class institutions . Who knows what else they could be up to . I was very proud to cosponsor Senator Blackburn  Transparency for Confucius Institutes Act , which would provide needed transparency to these dangerous organizations . I was also glad to see Alabama A & M , a public land-grant and historically Black university , make the decision to close their Confucius Institute just last month . Congress has made clear that American institutions of higher education that host Confucius Institutes could lose their Federal funding . I hope any remaining colleges and universities with these CCP satellite organizations follow Alabama A & M  leadership . The United States and the entire Western World have given China valuable concessions for decades . We gave China a seat at the table thinking they would change , but they have played their hand ruthlessly . The hope was that by facilitating economic growth through open markets and giving them leadership roles in the international institutions , China  Communist regime would finally embrace democracy , human rights , and free market values . It is past time we recognize that despite all its good intentions , this strategy has failed and miserably . The Chinese Communist Party has continually spied on its citizens , violently suppressed dissent , and systematically persecuted religious and ethnic minorities to the point of genocide . President Trump stood up to China . He was the first U.S. President to do so in decades . And he made great strides , but he did not have enough time in office to finish the job . I sincerely hope President Biden will continue to build on the Trump administration  momentum in pushing back against China  aggressive rise . The United States must address the challenges posed by China . I have shared a lot of concerns today , but I am not one to offer criticism without a commonsense solution . Here is one commonsense step Congress can take immediately . The TSP , or Thrift Savings Plan , is the 401 ( k ) -style investment plan that over 6 million Federal and government employees , both military and civilian , use for their retirement plan . The plan manages more than $ 700 billion in assets . Back in 2017 , the Board that governs the TSP decided to invest billions in companies with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party . They wanted to send government employee dollars -- the retirement savings of our military and civilian public servants -- to Chinese companies , including mine and everybody  here in Congress . These companies are tied to a government that openly committed genocide against its own people . Well , with me , that dog does not hunt . Thankfully , President Trump put a stop to that plan before it was implemented , but now with President Biden in the White House , the Board could decide to push through this decision . We need congressional action to make President Trump  decision with the thrift savings plan permanent . I bet if you ask the folks who work in these buildings or who served the United States overseas if they want their retirement savings going to Chinese companies , you would hear a loud no . I will be offering a solution on this tomorrow to protect our national security and safeguard the retirements of those who have served our country with honor and distinction . I suggest the absence of a quorum .'\n",

The President  recent budget proposal for the Department of Defense does not -- I repeat , does not -- give our men and women in uniform the tools to do their job . It is clear that President Biden thinks we do not need further investment in our military . If it is clear , he thinks it is OK to ask our men and women to do more with less , and that is impossible . The world has changed a lot in 50 years . When President Biden first came to Washington in 1972 , there were two superpowers , the United States of America and the Soviet Union . Back then , we spent 6.5 percent of our Federal budget on national defense -- 6.5 percent . Today , we spend less than 3.5 percent -- a huge drop . Secretary Austin has said that China remains the top `` pacing threat '' for our military . Simply keeping pace with China is not enough . We have got to outpace all of our adversaries , but doing that requires smart , substantial , and strategic investment in our military -- much more investment than the President and many people here in Congress publicly propose . President Biden says he wants his administration to trust the experts on things like COVID , but this defense budget shows he does not apply that same principle to the Pentagon . Here is what ADM Charles Richard , Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command , who is over our nuclear capabilities , said in last week  hearing to the Senate Armed Services Committee : I have what I need to deter today . . . . But I need it modernized . There is no remaining margin of error . His warning is clear . We must modernize our greatest deterrent and keep peace among our adversaries with our nuclear arsenal . The free world , meaning the United States , works and sleeps under a nuclear umbrella that has not been updated to the digital age . We are also in a new space race , and it is a race we have no choice that we must win . In the next 20 years , the total cost of just arming space will be $ 2 trillion , and we have no choice but to win in space . The Chinese want to weaponize this new frontier of war , and we are falling behind . We are also falling behind Russia . We have got to make a change in attitude toward what we are doing in space , and it starts right here in this room . I heard about the growing gap between us and the Chinese when I visited the Army Materiel Command at Redstone Arsenal a few weeks ago in Huntsville , AL . These folks shared with me how desperately we need to modernize our space-based systems that contribute to our missile defense . The U.S. Army is the largest consumer of space products , and our military relies on the Materiel Command to provide the resources to train our soldiers for research , development of new equipment , and defend our Nation . They should not have to beg us or the President of the United States for the money to invest in the capabilities that we need . At the end of the day , our generals main report to us is , `` We can afford to survive . '' Think about that quote : `` We can afford to survive . '' We also need to invest in the safety of our service men and women , especially in aviation . Currently , the average age of an airplane in our military is older than the pilots flying it . Alabama is home to Fort Rucker , to which every Army helicopter pilot comes to get their training . When I visited the folks at Fort Rucker , they told me about the very real need for increased flight training hours for pilots , which requires more investment and prioritization in the defense budget . Alabama stands ready to continue to build our military so we can maintain our status as a preeminent fighting force in the world . We have hundreds of contractors and more than 200,000 employed in the defense sector across our State in Alabama . Those top-notch men and women support our world-class military installations , from the shipbuilders in Mobile to Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville , and many places in between . Telling our forces to fight a war with outdated tools is like giving a football team some leather helmets and decades old , poorly fitted pads and expecting them to compete against modern equipment . But that is exactly what this administration  defense budget is requesting our military to do . Frankly , it is a huge disappointment coming from our Commander in Chief . We can not let our men and women down . In the coming weeks , I will be working with colleagues on the National Defense Authorization Act and budget that will enable our military to do the job better today and prepare for all the challenges tomorrow . I am willing to keep fighting for the United States by investing in the men and women who keep us safe . I urge my colleagues and President Biden to do the same .'\n",

    "rawji = 'Jim INHOFE . First of all , this is a big deal , what we are embarking on now . It is something that -- people understand it is the most important thing we do around here . Let me just say that my partner Jack Reed and I have been doing this a long time . I have often said how fortunate I am . You know , we hear all year out there in the real world about how everybody hates everybody in Washington ; we want to compete with each other . But , you know , every year when we do the NDAA -- that means the National Defense Authorization Act -- it is the biggest and the most important bill of the year . Even though people think it is all happening inside this 2- or 3- day period , it is not . It is something that goes on all year long , and we have gotten to know each other very well . We know there are some areas where we have differences , but very rarely do we have differences that would impair our mission , and our mission is the most important mission that we have year-round . So I appreciate very much Chairman Reed , what he has been doing along with me , what we have done together . The NDAA has a long history of bipartisanship , and Senator Reed and I have worked together to get this bill through the committee with an overwhelming , bipartisan , 23-to-3 vote to bring it to the floor . That is where we are today . That is something you do not hear about in Washington , that you can pass something out of a committee by a vote of 23 to 3 , but we did , and we did it because this is a bill that is done by the Members . The world is getting more dangerous by the day . We know that is the case . One notable example is what is happening now at the Ukraine border . Just weeks after conducting its largest military exercise in 40 years , Russia came dancing in , advancing a huge military buildup on the border . In fact , the Defense Minister from Ukraine was in my office this morning and was talking about all the things that are going on there . According to the image that we have by satellite , we are seeing tanks , we are seeing missiles , and we are seeing artillery . Here is why I am really concerned : We are seeing even military ambulances . Why would Putin be putting in military ambulances if he was not expecting casualties ? The answer is , he would not . So we have an idea what is going to happen . In addition to this equipment , the experts are reporting that 90,000 Russian combat troops are amassed along the border of the Ukraine. These troops are in a more threatening posture than they have ever been before . They are in the south and in the north . They are knocking on the door of Kyiv . All that is going on right now . It might sound crazy that Russia would want to deploy so many forces now in November to a region where the winters are brutally cold , but there is something not many people really think about ; that is , frozen ground is easier to move around heavy equipment like tanks and artillery . I am not the only one who is sounding the alarm on this . Earlier this year , Senator Rounds and Congressman Trent Kelly and I visited Romania , which , like Ukraine , sits on the frontlines of Russian aggression . At that time , Romanian military officials warned us that Russia was moving from a defensive to an offensive posture in the Black Sea . We are seeing that now . Everything we have predicted is happening now , and that assessment of the shift was actually right . Putin is capitalizing on what he perceives as U.S. weakness . He knows that our NATO allies are disturbed by the catastrophe in Afghanistan and that many of the European nations fear that the United States is no longer interested in trans-Atlantic security . The President should not have done what he did , and we all -- I think most Americans know that . It was a disaster , the way he put this thing together in Afghanistan , and now we know where we are on this . It is tempting to say that we have seen this before , but I do not think we have just like this . So this is about Americans , NATO , the credibility and the capability , and that is why the NDAA is so important every year but especially this year . But , first , let us be frank : Russia is far from our only threat . In 2008 -- this is a document that a lot of people have looked at and thought , why did not we do this before ? This was back , I think , in -- what was it ? About 5 years ago , it was put together . We had what we considered to be the top six Democrats and the top six Republicans on defense , and they put this book together . It is a very brief book , but we have been -- this has been our Bible . We have been doing this now for a long time , and the things that we were predicting at that time are actually becoming a reality . It tells us for the first time -- and this is significant . People do not understand this . For the first time , we have two major adversaries at the same time . This has not happened before . And , you know , we are talking about Russia . Yes , that is significant , and you have heard me say this before -- the Chinese Communist Party has been investing heavily in modernizing its military . Over the last two decades , their military spending has gone up 450 percent -- just in the last two decades . Now , we are not doing that over here . You know , I have to say -- and everyone realizes this -- these communist countries have a great advantage . They can move and move quickly , and they do not seem to have any limitations . Now , we are seeing the results of that investment . They have tested hypersonic missiles that we do not even have anymore . I have to say that again . Hypersonic missiles are something they have and they are using . They have tested . We have seen it . We do not even have it , and we do not have any counter to that . They are leapfrogging us in other critical areas , like artificial intelligence , and they are rapidly expanding their nuclear arsenal and infrastructure . These investments in military capability are done with real purpose . They are a threat to Taiwan and other allies in the Indo-Pacific . Ambassador Bi-khim Hsiao was in my office this morning -- Ambassador from Taiwan -- and we were looking at things that are going on there , just like we are looking at from the Russian area . But the threat China poses to our own interests ca not be overstated or underestimated . Meanwhile , North Korea -- so it is not just those two countries . North Korea is out there . Iran is out there . They are also continuing their threatening behavior . North Korea is conducting missile tests of its own , and Iran continues to back proxies striking at U.S. troops and our interests -- most recently , we have seen in Syria . The terrorist threat in Afghanistan is also resurging thanks to the disastrous drawdown that continues to undermine U.S. credibility . We know that ISIS-K and al-Qaida have the desire and intent to strike our homeland . This is something that a lot of people do not understand . A lot of people do not believe the threat that is out there . Now we know when they will be able to strike us , and it is closer than you think . As soon as 6 months from now , the Senate Armed Services Committee was told just last month this could happen . So I do not say this to be dramatic . This is a reality , plain and simple . The world is more dangerous than it has ever been in my lifetime -- by the way , people have reminded me over and over again yesterday and today , since it was my birthday , how long that lifetime has been -- and we have seen a lot , but we have not seen anything like this before . National security needs to be the top priority . Without a strong military defending our way of life , nothing else matters . We can talk about other things , but it does not really matter if we cannot do that . [ [ Page S8416 ] ] Since World War II , we have ensured peace through the world by projecting strength . Our military should and must serve as a strong deterrent to our adversaries , and they have to know that they cannot beat us . Some people are questioning that , but they have to know that they cannot beat us , and we have to show them that they cannot . Yet we are fully aware that they have things we do not have . They have technology we do not have . This is something we have not dealt with before . The inadequate defense budget request of President Biden , the irresponsible drawdown in Afghanistan -- something he should not have done ; the administration should not have done -- and the lack of commitment to shared nuclear security are calling that into question . It is evidence that we are not prioritizing national defense , and we already have seen what happens when we do not prioritize national defense . We see upticks in destabilizing , threatening behavior -- exactly what Putin is doing right now . Just imagine what would happen if Putin and Xi thought they stood a chance to beat us if we did not turn things around , and that could happen . It is a reality today that people do not understand and should understand . Americans take for granted the idea that our military is the best . You know , when I go back to not just my State of Oklahoma but all around the country , people assume that . You know , I am old enough to remember what was happening at the tail end of World War II . We learned a lesson . We learned to be prepared , and for a long period of time , we had the best of everything . We had the best modern equipment , all of this , and that is not the case today . Americans take for granted that we have the best of everything , but we do not . It is just not true anymore . Do not just take my word for it , you know , just take it from me ; a couple of weeks ago , the No . 2 military adviser of our Nation, General Hyten -- no one disagreed -- I do not know of anyone who would actually argue with General Hyten . '\n",
    "rawji2 = 'He was explaining how China is on pace to surpass us if we do not do something to change what is going on today . That is General Hyten . I do not know a more knowledgeable person anywhere in America or elsewhere . We can meet these challenges . We can put our country back on the right track . That is going to take real investment and real strategy . Congress has a very important role to play here . We pass the National Defense Authorization Act and Defense appropriations each year , and every year , we give our military what it needs to set this thing right . Now , I am proud to say that the NDAA of this year goes a long ways to making our country more secure . I am not saying it is perfect , but it is very good and a necessary start . And that is what this is all about now . It is what we are going to be passing -- I am talking about tomorrow or the next day -- and going into this long process that includes both the House and the Senate . So let us start with one of the biggest ways to strengthen our national defense : authorizing an additional $ 25 billion in funding for the Department of Defense . This is just a floor for defense spending . Now , it is important that we understand this President has not been a good President in terms of building the national defense . He just is not . You know , his budget request shortchanged our national defense . In fact , if you put his budget numbers in terms of defense and nondefense , the amount that goes to nondefense averages about a 16- percent increase , and the amount that goes to defense is a 1.6-percent increase . Now , that is the budget of the President . It is not my budget . It is not our budget . It has not passed , but nonetheless , that gives you an idea of where we are right now . The emphasis is not on defense . It should be , and it is not . The budget of the president request shortchanged the national defense . It did not even keep pace with out-of-control inflation . Inflation right now -- the figure is above the 1.6 percent , and that is where we are today . It actually cut funding for our military even as we face the growing threats that I mentioned . And we are talking about the -- compared to the inflation thing that is happening right now . So I am glad the Armed Services Committee almost unanimously adopted my amendment to increase the Department of Defense budget top line . This is the bare minimum of what we need to meet the threats that we face . This is what underscores everything we do . The bill also makes sure this money is spent the right way . As we have for the past few years , we are using the 2018 national defense strategy -- that is this book I referenced just a minute ago -- as kind of our roadmap , and we are using this for that . The NDAA focuses on the Indo-Pacific , which is our priority theater , by emphasizing investment in the region through the Pacific Deterrence Initiative , the PDI , which we started in the bill of last year. The way this works is we are -- it is continuing as time goes by . We have a bill , and the bill is activated , usually in December , but then we are already into the next year . So while this seems -- people say : You are only talking about one bill a year . It does not really work out that way . It strengthens our supply chain so we are not reliant upon China , but we are doing that right now . It addresses the threats posed from information warfare , and it deters the foreign malign influence . It also stands strong against Russia . Perhaps most importantly , it provides critical lethal aid to Ukraine , and we know that these things are working . While radios and cold- weather gear are needed , they will not deter the strategy of Putin and his ambitions . Weapons like the Javelin anti-tank missiles , on the other hand , remind him that invading and annexing Kyiv will have real and concrete costs . We know Russia and China are expanding their nuclear arsenals . Our nuclear stockpile serves as the cornerstone for our deterrent , so we have to keep it safe , secure , and effective . That is why the NDAA supports the nuclear modernization our military commanders say is their top priority . It provides support for our allies and partners around the world . Unfortunately , our allies and partners are questioning our commitment right now after what happened in Afghanistan , and they are feeling like they were being told and not consulted . They did not even know -- that withdrawal that should not have taken place but did take place in Afghanistan is one that they were not even aware of . It provides the reassurance of American credibility that they desperately need to rebuild and cement those relationships . With strong allies and partners around the world , we will ensure the balance of power in our favor , but we are not there yet . When it comes to hard power , this bill makes serious investments in equipment we need to fight and win wars now -- growing our naval fleet , expanding next-generation fighter capability , and providing for the largest investment in military construction in a decade . It looks to the future too . We know that we need to accelerate innovation and develop the technology that is going to help defeat whatever our enemies might throw our way . Yet , in many of these emerging technologies , we risk falling behind . In some cases , we already have fallen behind . It is kind of hard for us to accept that in America , as we went through several decades -- I think since the Second World War -- not falling behind , but we have now . So the NDAA of this year invests in defense technology that would put us back ahead of our competitors . That is our goal . Things like microelectronics , artificial intelligence , hypersonic weapons , 5G -- these are the areas that we are working on to get back in the drivers seat . We have fallen behind . It is hard to say that , that America is falling behind . You know , General Hyten said recently something that I really think is important for everyone to hear . He said that we must `` focus on speed and re-inserting speed back in the process of the Pentagon . . . and that means taking risk , and that means learning from failures , and that means failing fast and moving fast . '' I have to say that General Hyten is certainly one of the greatest warriors of our time . We should be listening to him . We have serious problems . We have to get policies and authorities in place to let the Pentagon move quickly and , as General Hyten put it , `` fail fast . '' As he retires this week , I think it is clear [ [ Page S8417 ] ] why he is a national hero . He knows what is going on . Now , too much is hampered by bureaucracy at the Pentagon . The NDAA encourages the Pentagon to move faster , to take risks , and to jumpstart the innovation that we need to succeed , but we have to realize the impact . This is really the most important thing this bill does . We take care of our troops . People talk all the time about how much we spend on military . I hear a lot of people around who do not think we need a strong military . A lot of them talk about why we spend more on our military than Russia and China put together . Yes , that is true ; but we have costs that others do not have . Communist countries do not have the cost of taking care of their people . In fact , the most important thing we do is take care of our troops . Even though China and Russia are building up and modernizing their militaries , they do not take care of their people -- they do not claim to take care of their people -- and we do . The most expensive thing we do in our military is to take care of our military . We take care of the schools and the people who are out there taking the risk . This bill takes care of our troops in so many ways . It improves their healthcare . It provides education and childcare for their children , and makes sure their spouses can have meaningful employment as they move from area to area . It is a unique problem that our spouses do have , as they are moving around the country . And so , again , we are competing with China and Russia and other countries , and none of them have this problem . This is the greatest expense that we do . Our servicemembers represent the very best in the country . If they do have to go into the way of harm, it is our responsibility that they are the best prepared , best equipped , and the best led forces in the battlefield , and the bill does that . But we do not want them to go to war . We want to prevent those wars from happening . As I said earlier , the best way we do that is by projecting strength , sending a message to our adversaries that there is no chance that they can beat us . The NDAA is the major way that we send that message . And that is why the NDAA -- the National Defense Authorization Act , the most significant bill of the year -- has been enacted into law every year for the past 60 years . This will be the 61st year . So we are going to get it passed , but it almost never comes up this late in the year . This is the disadvantage we are working from , but it always gets done eventually . We still have a lot of work left to do after this and not a lot of time to do it . You know , we cannot afford late starts . If you do late starts , sometimes it ends up being just down to four people . Both my partner and I have been in this situation where we have been down to what they call the big four , making all these decisions ourselves . That is not what we are supposed to be doing . That is not what we want to do . But that is why the NDAA has been enacted into law every year for 60 years . We built this bill around Member requests . This is unique . This is something people need to understand . We are getting our requests from the Members that are serving with us here in the Senate . We are going to have an open amendment process . '\n",
    "rawji3 = 'We are going to have an open amendment process , and this is what we have committed ourselves to do , to make sure we are doing . So you will get another chance to mark up this bill . So what we are doing right now is very important . You got to keep in mind , it is going to be done by the House ; it is going to be done by the Senate . It is going to be something that is the most significant thing that is happening this year . But we could never work too hard or too long for our troops and national defense . I know some of my colleagues are concerned about one provision we have got -- that we have in this bill at this time , which was added in markup and included in the House bill too . Now , I oppose the addition of this provision , which changes the military draft -- what the military draft does . And I want you to hear this because , if enacted , it would expand the draft so that it is not just about finding combat replacements to serve on the frontlines ; it also requires women to register for the Selective Service , not just men . I have always said , as a product of the draft myself , I know what the draft is . I was there and I served . I have always said that I understand that and I think the draft is essential . It changed my life , certainly . But I am strongly opposed to drafting our daughters and our granddaughters . So this is going to be coming up . We are going to be talking about this . Everything is going to be out in the open . Get ready for that fight , because that fight is coming , OK ? That is why I submitted an amendment to strike this provision from the underlying bill , and I will work to get it out of any conference report as well , OK ? Last week , we marked Veterans Day , and that should be a reminder to all of us why we do this . In fact , we have got 2.2 million reasons to do this -- 2.2 million future veterans -- our volunteer force , who put their lives in the way of harm and who rely on this bill getting done . And that does not even include their families , who are sacrificing so much . So that is out there , we know , and that is going to happen . I know my colleagues understand this . I know they understand our responsibility to our troops and to the American people . And so I look forward to our debate on this bill , and then passing it in the traditional , bipartisan way , as we always do ; and , together , we are going to fulfill our constitutional duty and meet these challenges that we face , and we have little time to waste in doing this . So this is the most significant bill of the year . That is what we are going to do . We are going to get it done . And let us go do it right , OK ? I yield the floor .  '\n",
    "rawji4 = 'Mr. President , I am very pleased that the Senate is finally voting on the fiscal year 2022 Defense authorization bill . It is the most significant bill of the year . There is an old document that nobody reads anymore called the Constitution . It kind of tells us what we are supposed to be doing around here , and sometimes we forget . We are talking about national defense . That is what we are supposed to be doing . That is why Congress has passed a defense authorization bill for the last 60 years . This will be the 61st year in a row . It will pass . It will pass in about another half hour from now . It is going to pass because it has passed in the past , and everyone realizes this is the most important thing we do here . A lot of people do not say that , but it is true . Every year , we come together -- the House and the Senate , the Republicans and the Democrats -- and put our differences aside and build this bill together and show our servicemembers that we really support them . I think that is so important . All we have to do is argue about this bill , and what we are doing is reflecting on the people who are out there on the line , out there making the sacrifice and losing their lives in many cases . It is important that they know this is the most important thing we do , and that is exactly what we did this year . It looked a little different this year because the Senate did not take up the bill until after Veterans Day . I was critical of Senator Chuck Schumer . We filed our bill -- Senator Reed and I filed this on September 22 . We did not take it up until November 17 . That is 2 months that was wasted that we could have used and used very productively . We do not need to do that . We ca not let that happen again . It is the most important bill we do all year , and it should not be left to the last minute . That is especially the case right now because we face threats like we have never before in my lifetime faced . We have China and Russia . They are growing and modernizing their militaries at a rate that we have never [ [ Page S9173 ] ] seen before and using their new technology to menace their neighbors . We are seeing Russia build up forces on the Ukrainian border , most likely intended to be used for them to attack . We feel that is what is happening now . We have seen evidence that China is testing hypersonic missile technology that we do not even have . We do not have hypersonic missile technology like the Chinese have . Those of us who have studied what happened in World War II , we swore we were not going to let this happen . And for a long period of time , we had the best of everything . In one area where America should have the best of everything , we did not have the best of everything . So we have seen threats and are seeing threats now that we have not seen before . Yes , on the Ukrainian border -- we know what is happening there . We know 100,000 people are ready to go in . The Russians are there . Now we are seeing China use things that we do not even have today . At the same time , following a disastrous withdrawal , terrorist organizations are resurging in Afghanistan . I think we all remember in Afghanistan -- what happened when the President went in and we had a withdrawal when we should not have had a withdrawal . Our allies and partners are questioning our credibility and commitment because of that debacle . Iran continues to expand its nuclear program , and North Korea continues its own provocations . In short , we have no shortage of challenges to our security and our military supremacy . The security situation with both China and Russia has gotten far worse since the Armed Services Committee first advanced this bill back in July . It has gotten worse over the last few days and certainly every week . I cannot think of a more necessary bill to pass right now , as we are going to do in another short period of minutes . This Defense authorization bill is the most important bill we have . I worked together with Chairman Reed , Senator Reed , Chairman Smith , Ranking Member Rogers , and the Armed Services Committees in both Chambers to build a bill that will help us respond to all these threats . We worked together . We worked together in the committee for a long time . People think , well , this is only something that we are doing -- those of us who are in the position to be providing the leadership in our military -- that we do once a year , but I can tell you right now , after we do this -- I think it will get passed today and will be signed -- we will start again on next year already . Our final product is a responsible , bipartisan path forward to strengthen the national security and gives our troops the resources , training , equipment , and benefits they deserve . We are talking about our troops . They need it . We do not want them to have close fights out there . We do not want them to have equipment that is not the best equipment . I am afraid that we are in a situation right now where that is the case . The first and most important way to do that is by boosting the defense top line by $ 25 billion . That is what we did . The very first thing that we did was to bring that up to something where it is $ 25 billion over the request of President Biden. I know defense is not the top priority of Biden , but we showed that it is a bipartisan priority in this Congress . In fact , it was the 2018 NDS . This is the NDS . This is the National Defense System . This is in 2018 , and we had six of the smartest Democrats in this field and six of the smartest Republicans . We got together and put together this thing called Providing for the National Defense . This was the Defense Strategy Commission . It is one we have been following since that time , and it shows that we can get things done . This is what we refer to . This is our pattern , and a budget cut like the President wanted is not going to get us there . In total , this bill authorizes almost $ 778 billion for the Department of Defense and for nuclear programs at the Department of Energy . This increase supports many of the unfunded priorities of the military, things they need that the inadequate budget of President Biden could not meet , plus things Congress agrees that the Department must fund in critical areas . And we provided a 35-percent increase above the budget of the President for military construction , the largest MILCON that we have had in over 10 years . We also provided a $ 4.7 billion increase for shipbuilding , allowing our military to purchase five new battle-force ships , which will be key in our priority theater , in the Indo-Pacific . And I think we know what the Chinese have been doing with their ship program . We bolstered support to key allies , like Taiwan and Ukraine . The NDAA of this year actually increases funding for the Ukrainian Security Assistance Initiative by $ 50 million , giving Ukraine some $ 300 million in defense , which is also in our defense too . And the bill includes strong bipartisan support for our nuclear deterrent , which is the cornerstone of our national security . We fully fund the nuclear modernization , which is a top priority for our military and will solidify support for a key leg of our nuclear triad . Our triad system is one that we have adhered to , and it is something that is working . This actually supports a key leg of that nuclear triad , which is the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent . The bill works at every turn to maintain our military supremacy and in some areas to spur us to catch up in other areas where we have fallen behind . We have fallen behind China and Russia in certain areas , and we do not like that . And this is what we are trying to correct at the current time . One area where we do that is in cyber security . We have people , not just experts on the outside . There is one of the members of our Senate Armed Services Committee , Senator Mike Rounds , who probably knows more about cyber security than any one of the advisers that are out there . The bill creates a whole-of-government approach , the public-private partnership to detect and disrupt  cyber operations of our our adversary. We also accelerate innovation in key emerging technologies , like artificial intelligence , hypersonic weapons , quantum computing , and 5G . We are doing these things . We are just not doing it as fast as we should , and this is one of the reasons that we are going to pass the most important bill of the year in just a few minutes . Our bill takes numerous steps to harden our industrial base and remove Russia and China from our national security supply chain . Of course , our top priority , this year and any year , is our troops , the brave men and women who have volunteered to lay down their lives , on the line , for our country . The bill of this year gives them a well- deserved pay raise and improves health . By the way , these are things that people who sometimes talk about the fact that we are spending some money -- I do not know how many times I have heard people say : Well , we spend more on defense than China and Russia together . Well , that is true , but we do something that China and Russia does not do . The most expensive item we have is taking care of our troops , making sure that the kids of our troops have schools to go to that are good schools , that we have good housing . They do not care about things like that , but we do , and we spend more on our military , and people try to use that against us . Well , our people are first , and we are the only country that believes that . It prevents servicemembers from being dishonorably discharged for refusing the coronavirus vaccine . This is something where we changed a system that otherwise would have offered a dishonorable discharge , and it is in this bill . So it is a good bill . It is not perfect . No bill is perfect . '\n",
    "rawji5 = 'There are some things I would have had in this bill and I am sure that Senator Reed would have had in this bill that did not make it . Before we close , I do want to thank the good people who work so hard on this bill on the floor . People do not realize that . You go back to the real world and you talk to real people , as I do when I go back to Oklahoma , and they point out that they do not believe that people are really working . But in the case of the military , they are . I just have to say the hours that they work . I had occasion to talk to the group about John Wason -- John Wason is the minority staff director -- and about the number of hours that he works and that his team works . And I am going to read the names of this [ [ Page S9174 ] ] team . Senator Reed is going to be reading the names of the majority on the team . But I think it is important that people understand that we have committee staff who work hard , and we are very thankful for the people who provide all that effort . On his team , John Wason has Rick Berger , Tom Goffus , Scott Richardson , Greg Lilly , Marta Hernandez , Jennie Wright , Adam Barker , Allen Edwards , Katie Magnus , Sean OKeefe , Brad Patout , Jason Potter , Brian Slatterly , Katie Sutton , Eric Trager , Adam Trull , T.C . Williams , Robert Winkler , and Annie Caputo . From my staff I had Luke Holland , Dan Hillenbrand , Don Archer , Dan Holder , Sam Trizza , Esther Salters , Jake Johnson , Jake Hinch , Alexandra Slocum , Victor Sarmiento , Dixon Yonan , Leacy Burke -- what would we do without Leacy Burke ? -- Laurie Fitch , and Naomi Walker . And sometimes we forget about the hard-working floor staff . Nobody ever mentions that . We have a lot of the same people who have been there for a number of years , and we could not operate without them . And they were really busy on this bill . And that is Robert Duncan , Chris Tuck , Tony Hanagan , Katherine Foster , Brian Canfield , Max Boyd , and Maddie Sanborn . I am grateful for all of their services . And do not forget : This is only half of the battle . After this , we have to go through and after we have made the priorities that we have made , the appropriators will get busy and do what they have done to be a part of this effort , which is the most significant effort that we are having . So today I encourage all of my colleagues to support the National Defense Authorization bill of this year-- I know they will -- and extend our 60-year track record of getting this bill done . And let us tell the troops that we love them and we support them . With that , I yield to Chairman Jack Reed . '\n",
    "rawji6 = 'Mr. President , before the Senator from Texas leaves the floor , I want to acknowledge that in Oklahoma , last Sunday , I was with a group of people , and , independent of each other , they asked the same question : Where is America , and what is happening over there right now ? Our best friend and most loyal ally in that part of the world , Israel , is being hit by terrorists , and we are sitting back and not doing anything . It is just not thinkable that that could happen . I think one of the most meaningful things that I had not heard before , stated this way , that the Senator from Texas stated was , if Hamas were to stop the attacks on Israel , Israel would do nothing , but if Israel were to stop responding , there would be no Israel left . That is the situation we have there . It is something that is not understandable . It is something that we are going to do everything we can to reverse . That is not why I am here on the floor , but I just wanted to mention that S. 1260 Mr. President , on this legislation that we are working on right now , we have an amendment . Senator Shelby and I , jointly , have an amendment . Now , we did this initially because I chaired the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee , and it is an agreement that we had 10 years ago . We agreed on parity , that anything that we do that is going to be defense-related is going to be equaled by nondefense . Now , that has been our pattern , Democrats and Republicans , for 10 years , but now the situation has changed , the way it is structured now in this bill , so that there is nothing in there for defense . Here we are in the most threatened position we have ever been in with China . Yet the China bill is doing all these things with China , but it is not doing anything in terms of the military that we are suffering under right now . We have to remember -- a lot of people have forgotten this -- that two administrations ago , in the Obama administration , we had a situation where , during the last 5 years -- that would have been from 2010 to 2015 -- the President at that time , President Obama , had reduced the budget for defense by 25 percent . During the same timeframe , China had increased theirs by 83 percent . Now , just look at that . That is what was happening . That was back in 2015 , and now the situation is really getting worse because , since that time , China has increased its capabilities in hypersonics and other areas , so that they are actually ahead of us in many areas . So what we want to do is just to be sure that , whatever product we come out with , we end up having parity between defense spending and nondefense spending . It is something we have been doing for a long period of time . So the threat has not improved over the last 3 years but has only gotten worse . I think that any bill that really seeks to address the threat from China -- the whole threat from China -- must also address China  very real military and its broader military-civil fusion that is taking place right now . That is why any response cannot separate out military and economic competition . It must be whole of government . And this bill is only focused on economic competition , not military . Our amendment , Shelby  amendment and mine , will make sure that any increase in nondefense , discretionary spending will be matched by the same level of increase to the defense spending . Now , this is not something that is just Republican . This is something that was agreed upon some 10 years ago by Democrats and Republicans . Yet that is not what we are looking at with this . So this would merely be going back and agreeing with what we all agreed to , Democrats and Republicans . In fact , in this document right here -- we often refer to this document . This is the NDAA document that was put together , to remind my fellow Members here , this was six Democrats and six Republicans , all recognized in their skills in military planning , coming up with this document . This was 2018 . Yet , today , it is just as applicable as it was back then . And that is what they talk about -- what is necessary this year to spend on military to try to keep some type of a parity with China . Now , this has to be our top priority . Our security underwrites everything else we do as a nation . That is why America is viewed as the leader of the free world . It cannot be either one or the other . It has got to be both . The Chinese are competing against us in every area , and this bill currently does nothing to bolster our national defense to confront this threat or to leverage our military and intelligence community  significant research and development expertise in this area . It does not establish the sort of cooperation between our defense and commercial sectors on technology and technological development that we need . China is not just investing in technology , manufacturing , and research ; they are also investing in military . They are putting more money into modernizing their military than ever before . China is on a modernization sprint . They have been channeling money into building weapons that we do not even have yet , like hypersonics . I was embarrassed about a year ago when China came out and in China , in their parade , they were displaying hypersonics , things we do not even have yet . That did not used to be that way . It used to be , following the Second World War , that we always kept ahead at that time . We recognized that there was a risk there and that the risk was something we had to meet . So they are on track to dominate in new capabilities like artificial intelligence and hypersonics and other areas . So , meanwhile , we are crawling forward because we are not giving our military the resources they need to stay competitive with China . We know what that looks like . It is at least 3 to 5 percent in real growth . Now , that is actually what is in this document right now . They have updated this to show that right now we should , in order to stay even with China , be upgrading somewhere between 3 and 5 percent , this year , in this budget . And we are reducing the amount . It does not even meet the cost of living . So in the military advantage -- that is what we use to deter China from moving from economic aggression to military aggression -- we have already lost our edge in some areas . So , to maintain our military advantage , it is going to take investment , but President Biden is not willing to make the investment [ [ Page S2775 ] ] we need . He is proposing to cut our defense budget , and that does not even keep pace with inflation . So , meanwhile , he is proposing to increase all other spending almost 20 percent , and in this bill here it spends as much on microchips for the auto industry as it does on microelectronics for our national defense . Can you believe that ? If we do not invest in our military deterrent , it is hard to see how any of our other efforts -- diplomacy , innovation , economic growth -- will succeed either . So we will continue to work in a bipartisan fashion to address these needs . I really believe that this should be the first amendment to come up . I do not know . I am not in charge of that . But it should be . It is one that should be easy to pass because it was agreed to 10 years ago -- that we did not need to be in a position where we are not keeping up with China . So our amendment does one simple thing . It is parity . It says any change that you make in the nondefense spending you have to have in defense spending at the same time . I believe that should happen . It should take place . I am hoping that we will have an opportunity to vote on that tomorrow . With that , I yield the floor . '\n",

    "rawjc = 'John CORNYN . Mr. President , in my lifetime , the People  Republic of China has gone from a poor and isolated country to one that now accounts for 20 percent of global domestic product . There is no question that the driving force behind this dramatic shift is the ruthlessness of the Chinese Communist Party led by President Xi . The CCP  ruling strategy can best be described as win at all costs , which means that China never thinks twice about disregarding basic values and international norms . But there is no question that the most immediate and grave threats are against countries close to China  borders . Last month , I led a congressional delegation to visit the Indo- Pacific to learn more from the people on the ground doing the hard work about the challenges they face and that we face in the Indo-Pacific . In my conversations with leaders in the Philippines , Taiwan , and India , I noticed they used a different vocabulary to describe China  behavior than what we hear in Washington , DC . They did not just talk about China  ambitions ; they warned of its threats of aggression . They did not just share concerns about China  unification with Taiwan ; they spoke of the potential for an invasion . They did not just bring up human rights abuses ; they condemned the blatant genocide committed against the Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in China . Words matter , of course , and the soft lexicon that is often used to describe the Chinese Communist Party and the People  Republic of China here in the United States and particularly inside the beltway has the potential to create a false impression about China  objectives , and it plays right into their hands . I think we should not continue to downplay the risks to the global world order and to peace itself by what China is doing . This is not just a government interested in competing with the United States and other countries by playing by the rules of the international order ; the Chinese Communist Party is an aggressive , even belligerent and hostile power that has made economic gains through stealing intellectual property and other activities that belie its stated ambitions to become part of the liberal world order . For example , it squashes opposition by committing genocide against its own people and muzzling -- even murdering -- dissidents . China has literally become a police state , where the volumes of data that they have vacuumed up in that country and the ubiquitous technical surveillance that is mainly cameras that chronicle every aspect of the lives of their citizens and the use of things like artificial intelligence have allowed them to essentially control everything that does go on in China . And these are the same tools that they intend to use on other parts of the world . We know China has spent a lot of money developing its military resources . It has come a long way , while the United States and other countries were focused post-9/11 on the Global War on Terror . While we were focused on the Middle East , the PRC and the CCP wasted no time in rebuilding their capabilities from a military standpoint . And they are now aggressively claiming other parts of the region , not just Taiwan , but contested islands in the South China Sea that are claimed by Japan , by the Philippines , and other countries as well . Well , as I mentioned , one of the greatest looming threats in the region is a potential invasion of Taiwan by the People  Republic of China . Of course , as you can see , Taiwan is just a small island of about 24 million people , just off the coast of mainland China . It is not much larger than the State of Maryland . In every possible way you can imagine , Taiwan is a stark contrast with China . For one , it is a true democracy . Voters go to the polls with the confidence that the election results are not predetermined . Successful businesses -- and there are many of them -- are built on good old-fashioned hard work , not government favoritism . And the people in Taiwan -- the Republic of China -- enjoy the same freedoms that we do here in the United States : freedom of speech , freedom of press , freedom of religion , and freedom of assembly . Taiwan has been a self-governing entity for more than 70 years , but the Chinese Communist Party falsely asserts that the island republic is part of its territory . Indeed , Taiwan faces China as the last outpost of democracy , standing watch against authoritarianism . Our congressional delegation met with the commander of the Indo- Pacific Command who described the current power dynamic rather succinctly . He said it is not a question of if China moves on Taiwan , but a question of when . Indeed , the language we heard from our military leadership and others in the region was far more urgent in terms of the threat of the People  Republic of China against Taiwan than anything I have heard here in Washington , DC . According to our top military leaders , we have an idea how long Xi might wait . He himself has said that he wants to be ready by 2027 . But there is absolutely no guarantee that President Xi and the Chinese Communist Party of the People  Republic of China -- there is no guarantee they wo not move at another time of their choosing . As I said , Taiwan is not the only nation on the CCP  list . China has territorial claims against a number of its neighbors . If you closed your eyes and just threw a dart at this region , you would likely hit one or more of those contested areas . Japan , the Philippines , Vietnam , Bhutan , India -- all of those countries claim sovereign territory that is also contested and claimed by the Chinese Communist Party of the People  Republic of China . Of course , it has not even been 25 years since China took control of Hong Kong under the `` one country , two systems '' framework . China had promised Hong Kong it would retain a high degree of autonomy for at least a half a century , but , obviously , Beijing eroded the freedoms and independence of Hong Kong to the point of basically hijacking that city and that entity . The Indian Minister of Foreign Affairs in Delhi told our delegation that Taiwan is not the problem ; it is a China problem . And I think he has a point . In other words , what is at stake here is much larger than the future of just one nation . It is the entire scope of Beijing  power and its ambitions in the region . Taiwan is not the final goal . It is the next step in a quest to reach regional dominance . Taiwan will likely be the first target because it has been identified by President Xi and the Chinese Communist Party , but it certainly wo not be the last . I think it would be the ultimate in naivety , first , to think , well , this is just about Taiwan . It is not just about Taiwan . China will continue to threaten ; intimidate ; and , unfortunately , I think , ultimately threaten and invade its neighbors . And if that aggression goes unchecked , the CCP  power grab will reach further and further . Plus , I believe in the power of deterrence , what Ronald Reagan called [ [ Page S8879 ] ] peace through strength . Nobody wants a military conflict in this region -- nobody . If the CCP can attain its goals without a shot being fired , they will try to do that . They are already trying to do that . But the fact of the matter is , if the People  Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party worked to conduct a military invasion of Taiwan , there are a multitude of risks of mistakes , miscalculations , and other dangers that could lead to a larger conflict . And I believe we have a responsibility in the United States to make sure , to the extent humanly possible , that that does not happen . We want peace , but we also want to stand up to the kind of aggression that we are seeing in practice and being threatened in the Indo-Pacific region . I believe that countering and first confronting the threats from the PRC is one of the greatest national security imperatives of our generation . Russia , obviously , is a significant power , mainly because it holds nuclear weapons ; but it mainly tries to find places where the United States is having a hard time and tries to make those situations more challenging for us . It does not compare to the Chinese Communist Party and the PRC in terms of its regional ambitions , its attempt to project its power and its control over the region . We need to reorient the way that our country views and responds to this threat , and I believe that time is of the essence . As I said , some people have said that President Xi could wait until as late as 2027 to try to take Taiwan , but there is no guarantee that it could not happen earlier if they deem it an opportunity to exist for them to do so . The longer Beijing is treated as a reasonable , goal-oriented country by the international community , the more aggressive it will become . One seemingly small step we must take is to describe China  actions with accurate terms . We ca not do the CCP any favor using watered-down euphemisms like human rights abuses when what we are really talking about is genocide . Here in the Senate , as we know , words are important , but those words need to be accompanied with action . We will soon vote on the National Defense Authorization Act , which will help us raise the issue and visibility of this potential conflict and raise the opportunity for deterrence in response to growing threats posed by China . We can do good work here on the Defense authorization bill to raise the cost to the PRC in the event they decided to invade Taiwan . The Defense Authorization Act includes a bipartisan bill I introduced with Senator Duckworth called the Taiwan Partnership Act . This bill would establish a formal partnership between the U.S. National Guard and the Taiwanese defense forces to strengthen Taiwan  preparedness . Should troops need to deploy quickly in the event of a crisis , they would be armed with the same knowledge and skills as our dedicated U.S. National Guardsmen . This would also help Taiwan build up much of its asymmetric defenses . The Defense Authorization Act also includes legislation I introduced with Senator King , from Maine , to ensure that the United States and Taiwan can improve defense interoperability . There should not be any barriers to cooperating on important security measures like integrated air and missile defense systems . The Defense Authorization Act includes other provisions to increase defense cooperation with Taiwan and equip the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command with greater resources . It also ensures that the United States will take a stronger approach and confront the threats being made by the Chinese Communist Party . This is not a partisan issue , as you can tell . After the delegation I led to Taipei , it was followed on by a bipartisan coalition mainly from Members of the House , and I think it is absolutely critical that that spirit of bipartisanship and the reality of bipartisanship continues to exist when it comes to the threat posed by the People  Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party . I appreciate colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have championed the provisions I mentioned and those who may have other ideas about how we can deter acts of aggression , not only against Taiwan but against other countries in the region when it comes to disputed islands and other territory . I want to thank Chairman Reed , Ranking Member Inhofe , and our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for all the work they have put into this bill so far . One of our most solemn responsibilities is to provide for the common defense , and this is the best way to ensure that our national defense is prepared to meet the challenges on the horizon . I yield the floor . '\n",

    "rawjc2 = 'Mr. President , on one final matter , we know the Endless Frontier legislation , which is on the floor today , is part of our response to the competition caused by an increasingly belligerent and aggressive China , and I am glad the Senate has taken up consideration of this legislation . In coming days , I expect both sides to offer amendments to strengthen this legislation and to ensure that it addresses a broad range of strategic threats . As Leader McConnell has said , a robust amendment process is critical to the success of this legislation . One of the most pressing needs , though , is to bolster our domestic semiconductor manufacturing , which will be addressed and is addressed by the underlying bill . We rely on these microelectronic circuits , or semiconductors , for everything from our telephones that we have in our pockets to the cars in our driveways , to the missile defense systems that are right now knocking down Hamas rockets raining down over Israel . Over the past couple of decades , as our need for semiconductors has increased , as we have become more technologically centric , so has our dependence on the countries that produce those semiconductors . Here is a graphic reminder of our dependency on foreign supply chains in order to supply these critical semiconductors that are so important to our economy and to our national security . As you can see , 63 percent of the global market supply of semiconductors comes from Taiwan , 18 percent comes from South Korea , 6 percent from China , but nearly 90 percent of chips are sourced from Southeast Asia . As we learned in the pandemic called COVID-19 , vulnerable supply chains are something we need to be aware of and to fight against . I am reminded of what President Jimmy Carter said in 1980 in the State of the Union Message when he spoke about the Persian Gulf and Soviet threats to the movement of essential energy supplies through the Strait of Hormuz . President Carter at that time articulated the Carter doctrine , as it came to be known . He said : An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America . In other words , it would be an act of war because of the dramatic dependence that the United States had at that time on oil flowing through the Strait of Hormuz . But I think you could consider today that semiconductors are the new oil . Instead of the Strait of Hormuz , we are now dependent on a supply chain from parts of the world we can no longer depend upon . Just as a blockade would have left the world with devastating consequences , a blockade of the semiconductor supply chain would have far-reaching , negative consequences to our national security and economy . In fact , we are getting a glimpse of what that might look like right now . There is a global semiconductor shortage that is largely related to COVID-19 and has led to far-reaching consequences across virtually every industry . In Texas a couple of weeks ago , I met with executives from companies across the range of industries that have been impacted by the shortage of semiconductors , including automotive , consumer electronics , and defense . So we need a strong response to restore domestic semiconductor manufacturing , which is why last year , Senator Warner , the Senator from Virginia , and I introduced what we call the CHIPS for America Act . Thanks to the leadership of then-Chairman Jim Inhofe on the Senate Armed Services Committee , that became law , and it will help restore American semiconductor manufacturing by creating a Federal incentive to encourage chip manufacturing right here in the U.S.A . But the thing we could not do then , even though the amendment we introduced passed 96 to 4 , to authorize this Federal incentive program , the one thing that was missing was the money and the finances in order to make this happen . My preference is always to fund things through the regular order whenever possible . We simply can not get into the habit of cutting the Appropriations Committee out of the appropriations process . But there is clearly broad support for the CHIPS for America Act . As I said , 96 Senators voted to include it in the Defense Authorization Act . I am committed to securing funding for the program created by the bill , and there have been many conversations about the alternatives available to us on how to do so . Originally , we introduced a tax credit provision , but unfortunately that did not seem to gain the traction that we needed . When we tried to get the funding in December , we came up emptyhanded . But today I am glad to say there is a significant emergency appropriation included in the underlying bill . But unfortunately , politics being what it is and Washington being a political city , there are unnecessary and purely political provisions related to the payment of prevailing wages , which U.S. semiconductor manufacturing companies already pay their employees , and they [ [ Page S2774 ] ] have created a problem for funding this noncontroversial measure to bring chip production back to American soil . I have reached out to our friends across the aisle to try to work in good faith to reach a compromise that allows this funding to pass with a broad bipartisan majority . There is a clear and urgent need to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing and to secure one of our most , if not the most , critical supply chains . Here is what a recent support of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence said : [ T ] he United States is almost entirely reliant on foreign sources for production of cutting-edge semiconductors critical for defense systems and industry more broadly , leaving the U.S. supply chain vulnerable to disruption by foreign government action or natural disaster . It is clear that other countries -- notably China -- are steadily investing in their own semiconductor manufacturing . Today , as I speak , China is building 17 fabs , or manufacturing facilities , in the People s Republic of China . The United States needs to compete , and in order to do so , we need to pass this essential funding . We should not be bogged down by bipartisan or political points to be scored when , in fact , they really do not make any difference to the semiconductor industry because they already pay high wages . The only reason to do this is to try to advance the interests of organized labor and impose additional costs on the construction of these advanced fabrication facilities . The fact is , this actually expands the role of prevailing wage requirements because this is essentially private construction , funded in part -- in a modest part -- by U.S. Federal tax dollars . So now is not the time to let politics get in the way of our progress . It is just simply too important to our country . I yield the floor . '\n",

    "rawjc3 = 'Mr. CORNYN . Mr. President , in my lifetime , China has gone from a poor and isolated country to now accounting for nearly 20 percent of global gross domestic product . There is no doubt that the ingenuity of the Chinese people has contributed to this success , but we know the driving force behind this dramatic rise is the aggressiveness of the Chinese Communist Party . Its aims can be summed up with four Rs : resist , reduce , replace , and reorder . China resists American economic influence by manipulating American businesses and industries and stealing intellectual property . It reduces internal dissent and free expression of ideas through mass surveillance and censorship of its own people , and it seeks to exert its power and influence in the United States . The Chinese Communist Party intends to replace America as the world  technology leader through the Made in China 2025 initiative , which seeks to achieve Chinese dominance in high-tech manufacturing . Finally , it hopes to reorder international norms and institutions around itself . That is their vision . That is their strategy . That is their plan . Now , the Chinese Communist Party  ruling strategy can best be described as `` win at all costs . '' In other words , they do not play by the same rules we do . And make no mistake , these ambitions paint an alarming picture for the United States and our allies . Former Attorney General Bill Barr said last year : `` It is clear that the PRC , '' or People  Republic of China , `` seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies , but to replace them altogether . '' In everything from electric cars to advanced robotics , to artificial intelligence , China aspires to lead global [ [ Page S3315 ] ] production and to dominate global production , and they are throwing serious money into the effort to get China there . China is expected to spend $ 1.4 trillion by 2025 covering investments in everything from 5G to artificial intelligence . This is not the time for the United States to be complacent , to sit back and watch the Chinese Communist Party pursue tech domination . By the time it has made significant progress , we would be too late . We need to take action now to ensure that our economy and our military can continue to outcompete China , and that is precisely what we can achieve through the Endless Frontier Act . As Leader McConnell said , a robust amendment process will be critical to this piece of legislation . As I was discussing with Senator Schumer this morning , for most Members , this 1,500-page substitute bill landed on their desks just a little bit earlier this week , so it is going to take a little time for us to understand and to digest the complexity and the ambitions , really , I should say , of this bill . In the coming days , I hope the Senate will vote on amendments from Members on both sides that will strengthen this legislation and ensure that it addresses the broad range of strategic threats we are facing . One of the most urgent priorities is to secure the supply chains of our most important products . We really learned that from the pandemic . When the COVID-19 virus hit , starting in China and then spreading around the world , we learned that China made most of the personal protective equipment in the world , and thus we were competing with China and other parts of the world to get access to the personal protective equipment that our first responders , our frontline healthcare workers , and others needed in order to be safe . That was one of the first signs that our supply chains may be vulnerable . But before any piece of technology becomes usable for its audience , it includes parts and pieces and materials that literally come from around the world . This was the theory of globalization : Go wherever this product can be produced the least expensively . But we did not count on pandemics . We did not count on natural disasters . We did not count on the potential for military conflict to jeopardize the availability of these essential products . Regardless of where a product is finally assembled and packaged , each of those individual pieces is key to protecting the supply chains of our most valuable assets . Right now , supply chains for everything from cars and cell phones to missile defense , to communication systems are at risk because of one tiny piece of technology called a semiconductor or a microelectric chip . It goes by numerous names . I have shown a floor chart previously , and I will probably bring it out again sometime here before we are through , but the fact is , the United States relies heavily on other countries for these essential advanced semiconductors . Nearly 90 percent of those chips are made by companies in Southeast Asia , including Taiwan . As a matter of fact , Taiwan alone produces 63 percent of the world  advanced semiconductors , and we depend on that sole source for these most advanced microchips . One company , Taiwan Semiconductor , accounted for more than half of the total foundry revenues last year , and , as I said , companies in Taiwan control 63 percent of the market . If for any reason that supply chain was cut off , it would lead to very , very serious economic and security consequences across our entire economy . In recent months , we have gotten a glimpse of what this might look like , particularly when it comes to our car manufacturing capacity . At the beginning of the pandemic , automaker suppliers predicted a drop in car sales , and so they canceled their orders for semiconductor chips . Semiconductor manufacturers replaced the auto chip capacity with other in-demand products , like chips for personal computers that kept kids learning while they were at home or chips that went into ventilators to keep COVID-19 patients alive . But American consumers kept buying cars at prepandemic rates , and the carmakers needed to make up for the chip to meet that demand . Unfortunately , restoring the production of auto chips is not a quick or easy process . There is a long lead time , in fact , to manufacturing a single chip , which can take up to 6 months . Although chipmakers are filling auto chip orders , we are still likely to face a shortage that may last throughout the summer . In response , some automakers have removed certain technology and extra features , like GPS , from vehicles in order to reduce the number of chips they need . Others have cut production across the board and laid off some of their workforce . But as bad as that may sound , it could be much , much worse . The squeeze we are feeling now is more or less the result of a backlog , and we have every expectation that in a few months , things will return to normal . But what if , instead of a decrease in supply due to increased demand , the supply was cut off entirely ? This is not some fictional doomsday scenario ; it is a real possibility . Our dependence on other countries for these chips could leave us in a very vulnerable position if access were suddenly cut off or restricted . Unlike the supply chain shortages we experienced at the start of the pandemic for things like PPE , hand sanitizer , and the like , there is no quick fix here . In order to build a single chip , you need very expensive and highly advanced equipment . You need the skilled workforce . And , as I said before , you need quite a bit of time because it can take months to build a single chip , and that is assuming you have the facility and all the equipment ready to go . A couple of weeks ago , I met with executives in Dallas who represent a full range of businesses and industries impacted by the current chip shortage . An executive at Qorvo talked about how the process of building a new chip fabrication facility is not just expensive ; it is time-consuming . It can take years to receive all of the high- functioning equipment necessary to build advanced microchips . Building a foundry is a huge undertaking that requires a massive investment . A single foundry where these advanced semiconductors are built can cost upwards of $ 10 to $ 20 billion -- $ 10 to $ 20 billion . Indeed , that is the reason why we are so reliant on Taiwan , because it is a low-cost provider . Again , we made the mistake of thinking that cost was the only thing that mattered , as opposed to dependability of our supply chain . So there is a clear need to bolster our domestic semiconductor manufacturing . The United States is not the only country that sees the handwriting on the wall . Other parts of the world , from South Korea to China itself , to the European Union , are investing billions of dollars in new manufacturing capacity . Right now , as I speak , there is one semiconductor foundry being planned for Arizona by Taiwan Semiconductor . China is building 17 while we are just getting started to build 1 . As I said , the European Union is investing huge amounts of money , about $ 35 billion ; South Korea is investing $ 65 billion ; and China is investing a whopping $ 150 billion in semiconductor manufacturing . Other countries around the world recognize the risks to their economy and their national security given the current semiconductor manufacturing landscape . Our competitors are pouring tens of billions of dollars into boosting their supplies , and the United States needs to do likewise , which is why Senator Warner , the Senator from Virginia , and I introduced CHIPS for America Act last year . The premise of this legislation is straightforward : to create a Federal incentive program to encourage chip manufacturing here in the U.S. of A . Rather than rely on manufacturers in Taiwan or China or compete against other countries for the limited supply of chips worldwide , let us bolster the supply of American-made semiconductors . This way , we can secure our most critical supply chains , create thousands of well-paying American jobs , and boost our global competitiveness by supplying made-in-America chips to our friends and allies around the world . We were not alone in thinking this is a good idea . In fact , when we considered the authorization for this CHIPS for America Act in the Defense authorization bill last December , it passed with a vote of 96 to 4 . So it is clear that the entire Senate understands the [ [ Page S3316 ] ] gravity of this issue and its importance . That authorization became law in January , and now we have the job of fully funding these programs so they can actually get to work turning over dirt and getting these foundries off the ground . The strong support for this legislation on a bipartisan basis shows that this is a priority for a majority of the Members of this body . There is no reason these funding programs should not be bipartisan too . We are already seeing divisions about provisions related to the payment of a prevailing wage , so-called Davis-Bacon provisions , which is , frankly , dividing us , which is a moot issue given the current wages of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing companies . It is a nonissue for them . Yet some of our Democratic colleagues decided to insert this divisive issue in this underlying Endless Frontier bill . We should not allow unnecessary or purely political provisions to weaken our strong support to our consensus commitment to deal with these vulnerable supply chains . I am committed to securing funding to bolster our domestic semiconductor manufacturing , and there have been a lot of conversations about the most effective way to do so . But let me be clear . The Davis-Bacon provisions inserted into the committee markup in the Endless Frontier bill is jeopardizing this funding . I hope our friends on the other side of the aisle will work with us in good faith to come up with a compromise that allows this funding to pass with broad bipartisan support , just like the CHIPS for America Act . There is a clear and present need and , I might say , a clear and present danger to the United States . We need to bolster our domestic semiconductor manufacturing and secure one of our most vulnerable supply chains . As I said , this is a matter of both our economic and national security and something far too important to fall prey to partisan jockeying . I yield the floor . I suggest the absence of a quorum.'\n",

    "rawjc4 = 'Mr. President , the Senate is moving quickly , I hope , toward a vote on a far-reaching proposal to confront threats from China . Based on everything we know about the might and the ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party , there is a clear and urgent need for us to take action . Every year , the U.S. intelligence community issues a threat assessment report outlining the greatest challenges confronting our country on the horizon . Topping the latest report , which was released last month , is China  push for global power . The report outlines China  efforts to strengthen its military power , diversify its nuclear arsenal , and fine-tune its cyber espionage skills , which are already quite considerable . One major area that can not be overlooked is China  industrial policy . Through the CCP  Made in China 2025 initiative , it seeks to achieve China  dominance in high-tech manufacturing . For everything from electric cars to advanced robotics , to artificial [ [ Page S3846 ] ] intelligence , to quantum computing , China wants to lead global production , and they are throwing serious money into the effort to get there . China is expected to spend $ 1.4 trillion by 2025 , covering investments in everything from 5G to artificial intelligence . The 2021 threat assessment report raises alarm bells here too . It says China will maintain these efforts because `` Chinese leaders see this strategy as necessary to reduce dependence on foreign technologies , enable military advances , and sustain economic growth and thus ensure the CCP  survival . '' I view this as both an alarming statement but really more as a call to action . If China is making these kinds of investments to increase its independence and global presence , we should be investing in our industrial base and our national security here at home . The most important place to start , I believe , is with semiconductor manufacturing . The pandemic is hopefully soon to be in our rearview mirror as more and more Americans , more and more people get vaccinated . One of the most important lessons I believe we should have learned is the vulnerability of our supply chains , everything from personal protective equipment , most of which is made in China -- and in the global race to get the PPE we needed during the pandemic , China got a head start because China manufactured it and we did not here at home . So that opened up my eyes to the vulnerability of that supply chain , but we cannot stop there . We need to look at how heavily we rely on other countries for semiconductors because nearly 90 percent of the semiconductors in the world are made in Southeast Asia , with Taiwan dominating the market . In fact , one company , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company , accounted for more than one-half of total foundry revenues last year . Companies in Taiwan control 63 percent of the advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the world . Now , if you are like me , before I got involved in this issue , I did not really know very much about semiconductors , so I asked my staff to explain to me the significance of this vulnerability . They said : Well , Senator , think of it this way : Everything with an off and on switch involves semiconductors . Well , that helped me quite a bit . Then I asked them to research something for me . I said : You see those rockets that are raining down on Israel from Hamas ? Some of those interceptors are made by Raytheon , an American-based defense contractor . Ask them how many semiconductors are in a single interceptor . They did the research , and they reported back -- 750 semiconductors in a single interceptor . So these semiconductors or microelectronics are everywhere , everywhere -- in the phones we carry , in the planes that our Air Force , Navy , and Marines are flying , the fifth-generation stealth fighter , the F-35 . Semiconductors are everywhere . Given China  ambitions , it is easy to imagine how they might be tempted to interfere with the supply chain and our dependence on Asian-produced semiconductors . If China were to block or even invade Taiwan , we would be literally helpless . Back in 1980 , Jimmy Carter gave a speech in which he laid down what came to be known as the Carter Doctrine . This was 2 years after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan . He wanted to send a message to the world that they should not mess with U.S. access to the oil that came through the Strait of Hormuz in the Middle East . So he laid down the Carter doctrine . He said : Anybody who interferes with our access to the oil that we need to power our armed services and our economy , that would be an act of war . Well , I do not think it is an exaggeration to say if another country were to block our access to semiconductors , it could well rise to the same sort of act of war that Jimmy Carter warned about in 1980 . In other words , semiconductors have become the new oil in terms of our dependency , and it is a dangerous dependency we must correct . This is precisely why the senior Senator from Virginia and I , Senator Warner , introduced the CHIPS for America Act . It is crucial that we shore up our dependence on chips manufactured overseas and we shore up our domestic production . The vast majority of our colleagues have agreed that this is a critical task . It was carefully crafted after monthslong bipartisan , bicameral negotiations . Recently , we had a meeting at the White House , and President Biden agreed with us that this was a critical imperative . This is literally a bipartisan , bicameral agreement with the executive branch and legislative branch that this is something we need to fix . Last fall , when we took up the National Defense Authorization Act , we introduced an amendment that authorized what we now hope to be able to pay for , which is an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act , which passed 96 to 4 . Now we need to fund the program , and there is just one issue standing in the way . During committee consideration of the Endless Frontier Act , an amendment was adopted that would apply controversial Davis-Bacon language to the underlying CHIPS for America provision signed into law last year . This provision creates , I believe , an unnecessary distraction from our focus , which should be on defeating this vulnerability in the supply chain . The fact is , current wages of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing companies do not need Davis-Bacon . They pay much better than the prevailing wage Davis-Bacon would require . So it is really a nonissue when it comes to semiconductor manufacturing . But what is more significant -- and I think the reason why some of our Democratic friends are insisting on this inclusion -- is it represents an expansion over labor policies by applying it to private construction as opposed to public works . Obviously , this would set a troublesome precedent . Leaving this language in the bill , I do believe , has the potential to weaken the support for the broader legislation . And I hope we can all agree that the stakes are too high to risk letting that happen . Last week , I introduced an amendment to strike this unnecessary and divisive provision and maintain strong bipartisan support for the underlying CHIPS for America legislation . A partisan provision with zero impact is hardly a reason to sacrifice the strong bipartisan support we have seen for the CHIPS Act . Republicans and Democrats have worked very closely together and , I think , really in an encouraging and responsible way to bolster domestic manufacturing of semiconductors and confront one of the biggest looming threats to our national security and our economic security . Now is not the time to backpedal on the progress we have made . I expect the Senate will vote on my amendment later this evening . I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment so we can maintain the strong bipartisan support we have demonstrated so far for this critical , critical legislation . I yield the floor . '"

    "rawjt = 'John THUNE . Mr. President , I am pleased that today we will finally move to a vote on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 . Thanks to the Democrats focus on their reckless Build Back Better tax-and-spending spree , consideration of the NDAA , one of the most important bills we consider every year , was delayed for months . Of course , once we finally got onto the bill , Democrats rushed the process . Senators of both parties filed a total of 1,000 amendments on this bill , but not one -- not a single one -- of those amendments received a vote on the Senate floor . But at least we are finally here set to pass this critical legislation . I am pleased the Republicans were able to strengthen this bill in committee and in the so-called preconference negotiations . This includes removing troublesome provisions like red-flag laws that would summarily suspend the Second Amendment rights of our men and women in uniform . Thanks in large part to Republican efforts , the final bill is $ 25 billion above President Biden  inadequate budget request . [ [ Page S9172 ] ] We have made a lot of progress over the past several years on rebuilding our military , which , I might add , after years of underfunding and budgetary uncertainty , combined with heavy operational demands , had been left underequipped , undermanned , and underprepared to meet the threats of the 21st century . The situation had gotten so bad that in 2018 , the bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission released a report warning that our readiness had eroded to the point where we might struggle to win a war against a major power like Russia or China -- an especially chilling warning considering the mounting destabilization from both of these countries today . The Commission noted that we would be especially vulnerable if we were ever called on to fight a war on two fronts . But , as I said , over the past several years , we made a lot of progress on restoring military readiness . Unfortunately , President Biden  inadequate budget request threatened to undo some of that progress . So I am pleased -- very pleased -- that , thanks in large part to Republican efforts , Democrats and Republicans have agreed on a final number that will continue our reinvestment in our military so that our men and women in uniform will have the resources they need to address the threats of the 21st century . With both China and Russia flexing their military power and the growing danger of a further Russian invasion of Ukraine , it is critically important that we ensure that our Nation is always prepared to defend itself and our vital national interests , whatever the threat . On the subject of Ukraine , I am very pleased the final bill we will vote on today includes an additional $ 50 million in military assistance for Ukraine . Ukraine has spent years dealing with a Russian invasion that threatens to push further into its sovereign territory , and we should be supporting the efforts of this free nation to defend itself from Russian aggression . I am particularly proud to announce that this year  NDAA contains the necessary funding to continue essential preparation for the B-21 mission at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota . We found out in June of this year that Ellsworth had officially been named `` Main Operating Base 1 '' for the future B-21 bomber , home of the Raider . This designation not only means Ellsworth will be the first base to host the B-21 Raider but will also host the formal training unit and the first operational squadron . The stealth B-21 bomber will eventually replace the Air Force  B-1s , which have been a proven workhorse within Global Strike Command but must be divested to free up capacity and resources for an even more agile and capable bomber fleet . Once operational , the B-21 Raider will be a critical part of our Nation  long-range strike capabilities and nuclear deterrent well into the future . I am incredibly proud that South Dakota and Ellsworth were chosen to serve as the first operating base for the B-21s . When I first came to the Senate , the outlook for Ellsworth was not so rosy . I had barely arrived here in the Senate when Ellsworth was placed on the base realignment and closure , or BRAC , list . It was an all-hands effort by the congressional delegation and Ellsworth and State and community leaders to make the case to the Bush administration and BRAC Commission to remove Ellsworth from the closure list . Many thought that South Dakota might not have the clout to make this stand , that we did not wield enough influence . We were only given about a 12-percent chance of pulling through , but we were determined that we were not going to lose Ellsworth . We stood our ground , and we won the day . Ellsworth was removed from the BRAC list that August , and we got right to work on building up the base so that we would never again find ourselves in the same position . In 2007 , we saw the Air Force Financial Services Center open at Ellsworth , and 2011 saw the arrival of the 89th Attack Squadron and its command and control stations for MQ-9 Reapers . In 2015 , a decade-long mission paid off with the quadrupling of the training airspace for the base . The Powder River Training Complex is now the largest training airspace in the continental United States and can be used for large- force exercises that draw combat aircraft from across this country . It is also well-suited for B-21 training , which is undoubtedly one of the reasons Ellsworth was chosen as the first home of the Raider . I am committed to ensuring that Ellsworth has everything it needs for its new mission so that it can continue to serve as one of our Nation  essential military assets for decades to come . To that end , I worked to ensure that this year  National Defense Authorization Act contain not only full funding for B-21 development but full funding for the first of many equipment and support facilities that will be needed for the B- 21 mission at Ellsworth , including a low observable coating and restoration facility , a wash rack and maintenance hangar , expanding the flight simulator facility , and more . It is imperative that these and follow-on military construction projects at Ellsworth stay on pace to ensure the B-21 , once fielded , can begin operations alongside the current B-1 mission at Ellsworth to enable a smooth transition from one mission to the next . The National Defense Authorization Act also ensures adequate support for our B-1s in South Dakota and in Texas and deployed on Bomber Task Force missions so that they have the resources they need until they are replaced by the B-21s . I will continue to do everything I can here in Congress to support our B-1s at Ellsworth and advance the B-21 mission . Providing for our Nation  defense is one of our most serious responsibilities as Members of Congress . We have an obligation to ensure that our Nation is prepared to meet any threat , whether the danger comes from terrorism , rogue states , or major powers . We have an obligation to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the resources they need to confront the threats that we ask them to face . I am frustrated that it took us so long to move to consideration of this year  National Defense Authorization Act , but I am happy we did at least manage to secure a solid piece of legislation , and I look forward to voting for this bill later today . I yield the floor . '\n",
    "rawjt2 = 'Madam President , from the beginning , the story of the U.S. auto industry has been one of ingenuity , of taking risks , and of pushing forward . At the dawn of the 20th century , most Americans could hardly comprehend the idea of the automobile . Yet , 20 years later , they had become nearly ubiquitous in American life , thanks to the insistence of entrepreneurs like Henry Ford on making the automobile affordable for the majority of Americans . The democratization of the automobile , rather than the invention of the automobile itself , is , in my opinion , one of most remarkable and uniquely American success stories . Automobiles allowed Americans to capitalize on the economic dynamism of the roaring twenties and helped Americans move and adapt during the Great Depression . They contributed greatly to the American industrial base and the know-how needed to fight and win the Second World War and help propel the United States to its current status as a preeminent global economic and military power . Visionary investments like the Interstate Highway System made cars a staple in American economic and cultural life . And cars certainly made it a lot easier to get to and from rural America . In a place like rural South Dakota , with limited public transportation , the automobile , often a pickup or an SUV , is typically the only way to get around . Today , the automobile industry stands on the brink of a new technological revolution , which promises to dramatically transform mobility once again . Over the past three decades , the internet has transformed our economy and our way of life , and the next generation of the internet , 5G , which is currently being deployed across the Nation , will enable a host of new innovations , including a revolution in vehicle technology : automated vehicles or what we call AVs . AVs will change the way that we move in numerous ways , making the transportation system safer , more efficient , and more accessible . Individuals whose mobility is currently limited , for example , Americans with disabilities , could gain new independence with the deployment of automated vehicles , allowing them to work or visit friends and family safely and easily . I am proud that my proposed AV amendment to the Endless Frontier Act was recently endorsed by the National Federation of the Blind , and I ask for unanimous consent that the letter of endorsement be inserted in the Record '\n",
    "rawjt3 = 'Madam President , imagine a farmer in rural South Dakota who can no longer drive to get to town for appointments , prescriptions , or groceries -- enter the automated vehicle . This technology has potential to keep people in their homes and communities longer . Moreover , AVs have potential to greatly increase roadway safety . Currently , there are an average of more than 35,000 traffic fatalities on our Nation  roadways each year , including pedestrian , motorcycle , and bicycle fatalities . Automated vehicles could dramatically -- dramatically -- reduce that number . Distracted driving , driving while impaired -- automated vehicles could eliminate those dangers . For automated vehicle technology to advance , it is imperative that the regulatory framework catch up with private-sector innovation . That is why I have pushed for the enactment of AV legislation over the years and why I had hoped -- I had hoped -- that we would be voting to add my automated vehicles amendment to the legislation before the Senate today . I have spent nearly 5 years -- 5 years -- working in a bipartisan manner on a legislative framework to govern the testing and deployment of automated vehicles . The amendment I offered to the bill before us today is an amendment that I had hoped to be able to offer with bipartisan support . It would have paved the way for expanded testing and deployment of automated vehicles in the United States under the oversight of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration . And let me emphasize that oversight point . My amendment would ensure that automated vehicles would not -- not -- touch pavement without the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  certification that they are at least as safe as a conventional vehicle . The data gathered from the vehicles deployed as a result of this amendment would be crucial to the development of future motor vehicle safety standards for AVs . Unfortunately , bipartisan agreement on my amendment collapsed when special interests expressed their opposition , despite major efforts to accommodate their concerns . And I am deeply disappointed that , once again , Democrats yielded to pressure from special interests against the best interests of our economy and the American people . Advancing AV technology is not just a vehicle safety issue . It is also an issue of U.S. leadership and global competitiveness . Investing in the production of AV technology here in the United States would not only strengthen the resilience of the auto industry but also the Nation  industrial base and our national security . The auto industry touches nearly every American State . For example , Horton in Britton , SD , manufactures engine cooling systems , providing steady , good paying jobs for that community and strengthening the local economy . The same story repeats itself countless times in communities all across the Nation . Providing millions of jobs and investing billions annually , the American auto industry is a critical component of the nation  economy . Right now , [ [ Page S3551 ] ] U.S. companies lead the world in AV technology , but other nations , like China , are seizing upon regulatory inaction and striving to take the lead . If we do not move forward with automated vehicle technology , we will soon see some other nation leading the AV revolution . The legislative package before us today is designed to bolster the global competitiveness of the United States . It is pretty difficult to understand why this reasonable and , I might add , no cost AV amendment that would lead to untold benefits for our Nation  transportation system , does not fit in . How can a bill making strong investments in artificial intelligence , quantum computing , and advanced manufacturing exclude a legislative framework for AVs ? Are we really going to back down from leading the world in automated innovation and technology and cede the future of this industry to nations like China ? Will we really ignore the enormous -- enormous -- safety benefits of these vehicles just to suit the political convenience of Democratcs? More than a century ago , when the automobile was invented , there were plenty of skeptics , but America  automobile pioneers did not let that stop them . They seized the moment and pressed forward and ushered in a transportation revolution . We can do that again today or we can cede this moment to nations like China and let the American automobile industry fall permanently behind . That is the choice in front of us . I hope we will choose to seize this moment and pass the legislation we need to usher in another American transportation revolution . I yield the floor . I suggest the absence of a quorum .'\n",

Threats from near-peer rivals like China and Russia are not the only ones we face . Terrorists continue to plot to destroy our way of life , so we must continue to take the fight to them . With strong investments in new capabilities and readiness , this bill enables our warfighters to do just that . Finally , I think we were all horrified by the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan . This bill includes important provisions to provide accountability and ensure that we honor the 2,500 Americans who gave their lives in Afghanistan to keep our Nation safe .

We have maintained the bipartisan tradition of the Armed Services Committee . Now , while this administration promotes weakness abroad and tyranny at home , robust support for defense in this bill ensures that our adversaries understand that our military has the resources required to stymy their aggressive ambitions which will guarantee that our military will succeed if called upon . This legislation will enhance readiness by funding the unfunded requests of the services and the co-coms . It will maintain our commitment to the nuclear triad and modernization and aggressively enhance our space capabilities . It protects our troops against punishment for personal politics , prohibits dishonorable discharge for COVID vaccination refusal , and requires a plan for exemptions . And it begins to hold the Biden administration accountable for Afghanistan . Now , while this bill fosters U.S.-Israeli cooperation , including $ 300 million for multiple collaborative programs , anti-Israel Democrats have stripped the continuing resolution of $ 1 billion for the Iron Dome missile defense system . What does it say about the Progressive Caucus that they object to Israeli citizens defending themselves from missile attacks ? It is reprehensible and anti-Semitic . Nevertheless , this bill as it currently stands is a bipartisan bill . I thank the chairman and ranking member for maintaining the collaborative nature of our committee . I want to thank especially the chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee , John Garamendi , for his leadership and commitment to bipartisanship .

I would like to start by thanking Chairman Smith ; Ranking Member Rogers ; and my colleague on the subcommittee , Mr. Lamborn ; and , of course , the House Armed Services staff who have worked many long nights putting this NDAA together . The bill that is before the House is a good bill , and I encourage my colleagues to support it . The jurisdiction of the Readiness Subcommittee covers a broad range of topics from civilian personnel , sustainment , and contested logistics to military construction , energy safety and environmental policy . With that in mind , I would just like to highlight some of the issues we have dealt with . Consistent with our work over the last 2 years , the readiness provisions continue efforts to address the climate change challenges of extreme weather and the necessity to reduce the greenhouse gas emitted by the U.S. military -- the largest single emitter in the world . We require each installation to develop a master plan to do these things . The health and safety of our servicemembers will always be a top priority of the subcommittee . The bill elevates the focus of the department on safety by establishing the Joint Safety Council and requiring the DOD to develop a plan for the establishment of a Mishap Investigation Review Board to provide oversight and independent review of safety and mishap investigations . This mark continues the  work of the subcommittee to improve the conditions for the servicemembers and their quality-of-life infrastructures , such as military family housing , barracks , and child development centers . We also step up the requirement of the military to address the PFAS contamination on and off bases . The bill helps advance the near-term readiness goals of our military and drives the department to plan for and take action against long-term threats . Madam Speaker , I urge my colleagues to support the fiscal year 2022 NDAA . Madam Speaker , today I rise in support of the fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act ( NDAA ) . I would like to start by thanking Chairman Smith , Ranking Member Rogers , and the House Armed Services Committee staff who have worked many long nights putting together the NDAA of this year. The bill that is before the House is a good bill , and I encourage my colleagues to support its passage . As the Chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee , I believe the bill upholds our responsibility to provide congressional oversight of and support to the sustainment , logistics , infrastructure , and readiness of our military . I would like to take a moment and thank my staff for their tireless work -- the Readiness Subcommittee staff , Jeanine Womble , Melanie Harris , Jay Vallario , Wendell White , Ian Bennitt , Dave Sienicki , and Sean Falvey , and my personal staff , Betsy Thompson , Rebecca Wolf , and Scott Bohn . I am proud of the contribution of the Readiness Subcommittee to the bill of this year , and I would like to highlight the following provisions . Consistent with our work from the last two years , the Readiness provisions in the NDAA continue efforts to address the climate change challenges of extreme weather and the necessity to reduce the greenhouse gases emitted by the U.S. military , the largest single entity in the world . The bill : Requires each military department to complete installation master plans at two of their most at-risk installations within one year of enactment ; Requires the Department to amend DOD building codes to require consideration of microgrids with islanding capability as part of planned new construction , and encourages the department to renegotiate contracts related to existing on-installation renewable energy projects to enhance installation resiliency during power disruptions ; Requires installation commanders to consult with local governments to ensure installation master plans include outside the fence line resiliency considerations ; Requires the Department to assess energy and water usage at existing data centers and set conservation goals for new data centers ; and Requires the Department to include EV charging infrastructure needs in their planning for new domestic military construction , and requires the Department to adopt industry standard planning considerations in the development and rollout of charging infrastructure at military installations . The bill also builds on efforts to address contested logistics challenges involving near-peer competitors by strengthening operational energy programs : Requires the Department to create a working group of program planners , energy staff , joint staff , and geographic combatant commands to enhance integration of military department energy initiatives into operational planning and platform development to combat contested logistics challenges ; Requires the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy , Installations , and Environment to report on alternative fuels and mandates the conduct of a wholistic review of the associated production , transportation , geopolitical , commercial , and research and development of alternative energy ; and Requires the Secretary of Defense to designate a Combatant Command as the agency responsible for global bulk fuel storage , delivery , and distribution , and directs the so-designated Combatant Command to conduct a strategy on the infrastructure and programs necessary to optimally support global bulk fuel management of the Department of Defense .'\n",
    "rawg2 = 'The FY22 NDAA also builds on the previous legislative and oversight activities of the Committee to address poor conditions in barracks , child development centers and housing : Requires the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy , Installations , and Environment to report on and provide a list of domestic facilities and average facility childcare wait list , assess efforts to find solutions and reduce wait times , assess the extent to which staffing availability impacts childcare availability , and assess whether including childcare facilities in agreements for new private housing would be an effective solution ; Requires the military departments to conduct safety inspections and develop 10-year facility improvement plans for child development centers ; and Requires the Department to place higher priority on the sustainment of quality-of-life facilities such as barracks by setting aside a percentage of infrastructure sustainment funds for that purpose . Additionally , the bill builds on the oversight activities of the Committee to address preventable training accidents and build a culture of safety in the military departments : Establishes a Joint Safety Council within the Office of the Deputy Secretary of Defense that advises on all operational safety matters , establishes safety standards , collects and analyzes safety data , and develops safety priorities ; Addresses concerns about the quality and objectivity of the mishap investigations of the military department by directing the Deputy Secretary of Defense to develop a plan for the establishment of a Mishap Investigation Review [ [ Page H4801 ] ] Board , which would provide oversight and independent review of mishap investigations ; Requires the Secretaries of the Army and Marine Corps to develop a plan to address the recommendations contained in the recent report of the GAO on tactical vehicle mishaps ; and Requires the Secretary of Defense to review the risks , benefits , and plans for enhancing the protections for combat uniforms in an effort to protect service members from flash fires . Furthermore , the bill continues efforts to address contamination associated with per- and polyfluorinated compounds on and around military installations : Requires the Department of Defense to review current practices to prevent or mitigate AFFF spills and promulgate best practices for spill prevention and mitigation , enterprise wide ; Increases transparency and facilitates information-sharing with defense communities impacted by PFAS contamination ; and Places a temporary moratorium on the incineration of PFAS- contaminated materials until DOD adopts and promulgates EPA interim guidance for disposal . The bill continues to build on efforts to support the Department of Defense civilian workforce : Requires the Secretary of Defense to provide a report detailing the number of military , civilian , and contractor personnel assigned to or employed by OSD over the past ten years , to assess whether the number of civilian billets in OSD-Policy has kept pace with changes in the mission of the organization over time , and to provide a recommendation as to whether an increase to the statutory personnel caps  of the OSD is necessary to ensure sufficient civilian staffing and enable corrective action for any inappropriate contracting ; Prohibits changes to the size or function of the Naval Audit Service until the Comptroller General completes a report on the operations of the Naval Audit Service ; Requires the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan to address the recommendations contained in the Comptroller General of the United States report entitled `` Sexual Harassment and Assault : Guidance Needed to Ensure Consistent Tracking , Response , and Training for Department of Defense Civilians ; '' and Requires that the Secretary of Defense to establish relevant metrics , collect and report on diversity statistics , and report on the status of diversity and inclusion efforts among the civilian work force . The bill also continues efforts to ensure modern weapons systems are sustainable and affordable over time and to support our industrial base : Requires the Comptroller General to report on organic maintenance capability and capacity within the F-35 program including depot standup , technical data requirements , unique tooling , and contractor assistance in depot standup ; assess the potential to transition supply- chain management from a contractor-led to a government-led function , and ; assess key field-level maintenance challenges as well as mitigating actions . Requires the Comptroller General to provide annual reports in the years 2022-2025 on the F-35 program sustainment system , including an analysis of the sustainment strategy , an analysis of the ability of the Department o reduce costs toward affordability metrics , and an analysis of the efforts of the Department to provide oversight of key contractor-led sustainment functions . Requires the Secretary of Defense to initiate a pilot program to develop a digital twin of the facilities and operations of at least one government-owned and operated military depot that is not a shipyard . Requires the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition , Logistics , and Technology to review efforts to digitize field-level maintenance for ground vehicles . '\n",

Thirty days after an exemption is granted , the President would be required to submit a report to Congress detailing the location , size , duration , and need of the burn pit , the number of personnel assigned to the location , and the personal protective equipment or other methods that will be used by those personnel to mitigate the health effects of said pit ; Directing the Department to pay fees associated with the transfer of adopted dogs to the adoption agency or individual and directing the inclusion of veterinary care and services into the Joint Trauma Education and Training Directorate ; Including significant Facilities Sustainment , Restoration , and Modernization ( FSRM ) projects on the online listing of military construction projects of the DOD and MILCON contracting awards ; and Authorizing the Maritime Administrator to use appropriated funds to purchase duplicate medals authorized under the Merchant Mariners of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2020 .

    "raww = 'Robert J. WITTMAN . Madam Speaker , I thank the ranking member for yielding . I want to preface by saying that I do not agree with everything in this bill , but the committee-passed bill is worthy of support . I want to especially thank Ranking Member Rogers and Chairman Smith for their attention to minimizing extraneous provisions in the markup that have little to do with our national security or supporting our servicemembers . Our struggle to close conference last year because of these issues were wholly associated with provisions that are not connected to national security . And these attempts , I believe , were offensive , and similar attempts to include these unnecessary provisions this year should be rebuffed . Unfortunately , Speaker Pelosi has not listened to the lessons learned from the conference of last year and has decided to add several non-germane bills to the NDAA at Rules that have nothing to do with defense . I want to make this clear for my colleagues offering these amendments : We should not use servicemembers as a tool to achieve partisan gain . I repeat : We should not use servicemembers as a tool to achieve partisan gain . And I voted in opposition to the rule , but I hope that I can vote for final passage of the NDAA of this year. As to the committee mark , we started with an anemic budget request from the Biden administration that in the Seapower portfolio requested only eight ships , two of which were fleet tugboats . How the administration can set China as the pacing threat and reduce Navy force structure is simply baffling . Fortunately , with the leadership of Ranking Member Rogers and others on the committee , we were able to authorize additional funds to the defense top line to provide the real growth necessary to dissuade future conflict . With this , we authorized 13 battle force ships and rebuffed the request of the administration to retire three cruisers . Additionally , we sought to expand the submarine industrial base by authorizing funds that enable a submarine construction build rate of three by 2025 . The mark also includes critical capabilities to support the deterrence of our Nation with continued strong investments in the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine and the B-21 Raider bomber . I think this is a good bill in its current form , and it is worthy of the support of my colleagues.'\n",
    "raww2 = 'Madam Speaker , I thank Mr. Rogers for yielding . Madam Speaker , our national security is in jeopardy . Russia literally has over 100,000 troops sitting on Ukraine  doorstep . Iran continues to threaten the viability of Israel and other regional nations , and China is preparing to bully the ASEAN nations into submission and declare their regional hegemony , not just in Hong Kong but the entire region . Just this year , China surpassed the United States in battle force ships and is rapidly approaching parity in our combat aircraft . Do we have the courage to stand up to these regional tyrants ; do we oppose an Iranian regime who threatens to destabilize neighboring countries while they seek nuclear capabilities ; or even do we seek to appease a North Korea who continues to threaten South Korea and even the United States with their nuclear expansion ? Our Nation sits at the precipice of a national security inflection point . I know which path our Nation should select and I am emboldened to ensure our Nation is prepared to choose , at a time of our choosing , what will be in the best interest of our Nation . A strong national defense is necessary to preserve our democratic ideals and the nations who seek to live free from subjugation and oppression . Madam Speaker , that is why I am particularly pleased that we have rejected a multitude of national security objectives proposed by the Biden administration . This bill authorizes a 20 percent increase in ship construction , partially rejects an ill-advised `` divest to invest '' strategy , and blocks a multitude of poison pills that were haphazardly tacked on to this bill . I thank Ranking Member Rogers and his leadership during the top-line debate this year . We are adopting his authorization vision today , a vision that ensures real growth for defense . I also particularly thank Chairman Smith and Chairman Courtney for their approach to national security and their desire to reach a bipartisan consensus , doing what is in the best interest of our Nation .

The NDAA of this year continues the tradition of the committee of improving the lives of servicemembers and their families by supporting a 2.7 percent pay raise ; increasing parental leave for new mothers and fathers , including adoptive and foster parents ; expanding financial assistance for in-home child care ; improving the legal representation for exceptional family members ; and demanding an independent review of suicides . Following the horrifying murder of Specialist Vanessa Guillen and a ground swell of activism from survivors of military sexual trauma , H.R . 4350 also boldly confronts sexual assault and harassment in the military , which has been one of my top priorities for a decade , by removing the commander from decisions related to prosecution of special victim crimes , improving sexual harassment investigations , and continuing to improve military criminal investigative resources . It also establishes standalone offenses for sexual harassment and violent extremism under the Uniform Code of Military Justice . These reforms will increase trust in the military justice system and encourage survivors of sexual violence to come forward . The bill also requires an independent review of whether to transfer additional offenses such as murder that are out of the chain of command . Where servicemembers serve , so do their families . That has been our mantra on this subcommittee , which is why this bill ensures that the military health system continues to have sufficient providers to meet the healthcare needs of beneficiaries. H.R . 4350 also improves services covered under TRICARE , including contraception , without copays . Together , servicemembers and their families make sacrifices for our Nation , and we must continue our commitment to them .

We can not erase their anguish , their pain , their abuse , their scarring , but we can , through this NDAA , change it for future servicemembers . Make no mistake , Madam Speaker , this is a seismic reform of the military justice system as it relates to sexual assault , as it relates to murder , as it relates to kidnapping . It is , in fact , creating a separate , distinct office which will be populated by those who are professional lawyers skilled in sexual assault , and investigators who will do the investigations . They will make the decisions as to whether or not these cases move forward . Beyond that , we make a crime of sexual harassment . We do not go far enough because , unfortunately , it is still in the chain of command . Mind you , 100,000 servicemembers are sexually harassed every year . Sexual harassment begets sexual assault . We have more work to do there . Beyond that , in this particular measure we have a 2.7 percent increase for our servicemembers . We also provide up to 12 weeks of parental leave . Our version had a required opportunity for 12 weeks , but that was changed , and , hopefully , we will move on that in the future . We are improving childcare centers that are failing . We have required an independent review commission to look at suicides within the military . Madam Speaker , we have now required racial and gender data collection for NJP .

    "rawrp = 'Rand Paul Mr. President , we are currently $ 28 trillion in debt . Whose fault is it -- Republicans ? Democrats ? The answer is yes , yes on both fronts . Both parties are responsible for the debt , and one side is honest about it . One side will tell you they do not give a fig about the debt : The debt be damned . We are for new monetary theories . Spend as much as you have got ; borrow as much as you can ; and somehow we are going to combat the influence of China by borrowing more money from China . It does not really seem to make a lot of sense , but that is where we are . So we have before us a bill that will simply add to the debt . We will go further in debt . You might make the argument that we are actually less strong as a nation the more in debt we are . Where is the opposition ? Now , there is no opposition on one side of the [ [ Page S3916 ] ] aisle , and on the other side , there is feigned opposition . The Republicans will feign opposition to the debt . They will say : Well , yes , we care about the debt , and the other side spends too much and borrows too much . You will hear Republicans throughout the land campaigning against the debt , only to come to Washington and vote for most of the debt . So what we end up with is a $ 28 trillion debt . We actually borrow more in a month than we used to borrow in a year . In March of this year , we borrowed $ 660 billion in 1 month . The proposals for spending are alarming . We have spent and borrowed more in the last 2 years than we did during World War II . There are going to be repercussions of so much borrowing in such a short period of time . We are seeing a misallocation of capital throughout the economy . We are seeing a grossly inflated stock market . We are starting to see inflation throughout the supply chain throughout the economy . There are going to be repercussions . The question we have to ask ourselves is , Are we willing to look at the example of countries like Venezuela or Zimbabwe that completely destroyed their currencies ? People say that could not happen in America . It largely has not happened because we have been the reserve currency of the world . We have been fortunate . People describe it as having the cleanest shirt in a closet full of dirty shirts . The dollar is weakened by such extravagant spending . Yet people still cling to the dollar because the other currencies are weaker . This bill simply adds more to the debt . We say we are going to combat China through this bill , but we are going to combat China by increasing a Department of government -- the National Science Foundation -- that is actually , probably , one of the most wasteful Agencies in government . William Proxmire was a conservative Democrat from Wisconsin back in the sixties and seventies . He started an award called the Golden Fleece Award . One of the first Golden Fleece Awards William Proxmire gave was an award for a study about what makes people fall in love . You would think , with the lampooning through the years of the ridiculous lizards on treadmills and of Panamanian frogs , that , after a while , people would say : Instead of giving more money to this Agency that is so full of waste and ridiculous studies , we should give it less money . So , perhaps , if we wanted it to reform , we would say to the National Science Foundation : Instead of increasing your budget 68 percent , why do not we reduce your budget 10 percent and say behave better . What if we were to reform how they pick their committees ? For example , if you want to study cocaine and if you want to study Japanese quail using cocaine and if you want to know if they are more sexually promiscuous , do you know how you would get approval for your funding ?

What they do is they select other people with ridiculous studies , and they say : We will vote for yours if you will vote for mine . So how do we get $ 500,000 spent in studying Panamanian frogs ? They want to know whether or not the mating call of the country frogs in Panama is different than the mating call of the city frogs . Well , in coming from a rural State , I can tell you that the mating call of the country folk is always different than the mating call of the city folk . We could have polled the audience . Are quail more sexually promiscuous on cocaine ? I think we could have polled the audience . The thing is , there could be some reforms . For example , as much as I am opposed to government spending , there are some important diseases . Let us say Alzheimer  , cancer , diabetes , heart disease . Why would not we make the committees for the National Science Foundation have someone on there from one of the big five diseases ? Why would not we put a taxpayer advocate on there ? Why would not we have some sort of inspector general process so that this does not happen ? We have to review this . This is not an academic point . We have now discovered that the NIH was funding the Wuhan lab . So we should have oversight on what happens , but after 50 years of abuse at the National Science Foundation , we are still studying will people eat ants to combat climate change . Seriously , that was a study . How many ants will people eat , and how many ants do you have to eat to reduce the global warming by 1 degree ? It is a lot of ants . The thing is , those are the kinds of studies that we are having coming out of here , and we do not make it any better by increasing their budgets . If you are a wasteful Agency and we give you more money , we will get more waste . If you want less waste -- and this goes not only for this . It goes for the military . It goes for any other Agency of government . If you give any Agency more government money , you will get more waste . You wo not get less . The cocaine was actually the NIH , not the NSF . The NIH has got some of the same problems . One of the ones from the NIH , in recent years , was $ 2 million to see , if someone in the buffet line in front of you -- when you are going through the buffet or Luby  Cafeteria -- sneezes on the food , are you more or less likely to eat the food ? $ 2 million . Now , look , if you want to come to me and say that we should study Alzheimer  disease , I have open ears -- and on heart disease , diabetes -- but if you want to study whether if somebody sneezes on the food makes you more or less likely to eat the food , that is just ridiculous . The American people know it is ridiculous . If the American people could see what we are voting on , they would say : Oh , we are going to combat China by giving more money to the most wasteful Agency in the world . Where is the money coming from ? Is it out of a surplus ? Can we go over to the Federal Reserve and open this big safe ? Is there a big case of money ? Is there a rainy day fund ? Is there a savings account that we can tap into to say we are going to have government-funded research to combat China ? No . We have to borrow the money from China . Think of the irony . We borrow the money from China to put it into technology . We complain about Chinese socialism , which is the government running everything and spending all of the money . So what are we going to do ? The same thing . We are going to borrow the money from China . Then we are going to have government-directed research , to which we will all say : Oh , socialism is not good , but the government directed this . Yet we are going to do the same thing , and we are going to be stronger than China . '\n",
    "rawrp3 = 'This is a good example -- and this is sort of a technical detail -- of how the committee process works and how grant funding works . There was $ 700,000 allotted from the National Science Foundation for autism . Look , I know parents who have kids with autism , and I can be convinced that the Federal Government can be involved in some way , but the $ 700,000 that was allotted for autism was then taken and subcontracted to a bunch of eggheads who wanted to listen to a tape of Neil Armstrong on the Moon . If you are as old as I , you can remember being in school and seeing the crackly black-and-white pictures coming back from the Moon and hearing Neil Armstrong say : `` [ O ] ne small step for man , one giant leap for mankind  -- or did he say : `` [ O ] ne small step for a man  ? A group of `` researchers  -- and I use the term loosely -- at the National Science Foundation got $ 700,000 of autism money to study one word , the preposition `` a .  Did Neil Armstrong use the letter `` a  or the word `` a  or did he not ? So they studied , and they were diligent . They listened to this 20-second clip over and over again . I think it took them a year of listening to this . They wrote reports and had findings . Do you know what their conclusion was in the end ? It was , We just do not know . We just do not know . Was it `` [ O ] ne small step for man  or `` [ O ] ne small step for a man  ? This is something you could fix before throwing and heaping more borrowed money on the National Science Foundation . Maybe we could say that you cannot subcontract money that was meant for Alzheimer  to ridiculous research . [ [ Page S3917 ] ] How would you stop it ? Maybe you would have a committee that reviews the grants and that has someone on the committee from one of the big five diseases who actually says : Should we be spending the money on autism or should we spend the money on Neil Armstrong  statement on the Moon ? Should we be spending it on this versus diabetes ? You see , everything is a tradeoff . Everybody comes to Washington . If you ask them -- you know , the people who advocate for Alzheimer  or diabetes or cancer -- `` Are you getting enough money ?  and when I tell the autism parents that their money went to study Neil Armstrong , do you know what I get ? I get dropped jaws and people going : You have got to be kidding me . My mother or father is dwindling away from Alzheimer  , and they spent money studying Neil Armstrong ? Did he say : `` [ O ] ne small step for man  or `` [ O ] ne small step for a man  ? This is lizards on the treadmill . Dr. Coburn was a Senator here for a long time , and he liked to talk about waste as I do . This was a decade ago -- maybe more -- that Senator Coburn was on the floor and would be talking about lizards on a treadmill . I think his was lizards underwater on a treadmill or -- no . It was shrimp on a treadmill , I think . They have got lizards on treadmills , but they have got shrimp , and they have got crawfish on treadmills . Think about it , really . We are a big , proud country , but we are $ 1 trillion in debt . Before we get to all of the extra stuff -- before we get to all of the COVID bailouts -- we are $ 1 trillion in debt just from the institutional expenses of the country . We bring in about $ 3 trillion in revenue , and we spend about $ 4 trillion . Of the money that we bring in , $ 3 trillion is a lot . We could spend that on a lot of good things , but we cannot simply just say we are going to spend it on lizards on a treadmill and that somehow we have enough money to do that . So of the expenses that we have , most of the money is consumed by Medicare , Medicaid , Social Security , food stamps , and the military , and then a variety of the welfare programs . But that consumes $ 1 trillion more than comes in . '\n",
    "rawrp4 = 'So we have been meeting over the last year , just spending extra money beyond the trillion-dollar deficit . So we have a trillion-dollar deficit just from our ordinary expenses , and then we add to that , you know , a couple trillion here for COVID last year , a couple trillion more . We are going to do a couple trillion more for free college , free daycare , free this , free that , but it is not free . There is no such thing as a free lunch . There is nothing in this world that you will get for free . You will either have the future paying for it -- our kids and our grandkids paying for it -- or you will pay for it through inflation or you will pay for it through default . And you can default in a dramatic way , through the destruction of a currency , or you can default in a gradual way through price inflation . As it is , we are starting to see the price inflation take off . There are people concerned about inflation that is already in the stock market and where this goes from here . But I do not think this bill makes us stronger . In fact , I think the Chinese sit back and , you know , hold their hand up and sort of titter and laugh at America thinking they are going to be stronger by borrowing more money from China . So I just do not think it makes us any stronger at all . I think it makes us weaker , and it would be one thing if it were not being so horribly wasted . Lizards on a treadmill . So they get the lizard on a treadmill and then they have active x rays to look at its joints . They were curious as to why a lizard waddles . So if you have ever seen a lizard or an iguana when they walk funny , they waddle . So why do they waddle ? You know , what do their joints look like in x rays ? And so we spent , you know , $ 1.5 million studying lizards on a treadmill . One of the perennial problems in the Third World is the black market . We have it in our country . It is sort of a function of when taxes and regulation in the official economy become so onerous that you need to escape the official economy . That is what the black market is . So a good example is New York City . The taxes on cigarettes are so high in New York City that you have a black market . In fact , the death of Eric Garner -- the sad death of Eric Garner being choked to death in New York City had to do with taxes . And some people were offended by this . They go : It was police brutality . Of course , it was , but it was police brutality based on exorbitant taxes that caused this man to be selling cigarettes -- loose cigarettes in order to try to make a living . But that is what happens when government becomes so big . So in parts of Africa , Uganda in particular , there is a big black market . And so God knows why or why in the world we are spending our money studying this , we decided to study gambling in Uganda . So we spent $ 30,000 studying gambling in Uganda . Well , it turns out the black market develops because they do not have good title to their land , they do not have good rule of law , they do not have the things that have made our country great . But instead of sort of exporting think tank ideas on how great capitalism is , we waste it through government grants studying why Ugandans gamble . It kind of is reminiscent going back to the Wuhan lab . People say -- this is what Dr. Fauci has been saying . Dr. Fauci says : Well , who would not want to study the SARS virus ? Well , yeah , we should . But , then again , why would we pay the Chinese to do it ? Well , there are all these viruses in China . Well , are the Chinese destitute ? I think we are here because the Chinese are kicking our butt in trade , and everybody is worried about China so we are going to do all this stuff to combat China , and yet we send money to a Chinese lab . Now , we recently voted to change that , but it has been going on for decades . In fact , Dr. Fauci , in committee the other day , said he still trusts the Chinese , the Chinese scientists . He seems oblivious to the fact that perhaps there is a military influence in these labs and perhaps the scientists do not do anything without permission of the Chinese military ; perhaps if there was a militarization of the virus going on -- oblivious to that . So there is a Space Camp in Alabama . My kids went to it one year . It is a great camp , and I am all for it . I , you know , would like to see more Americans go . If some American kids , you know , do not have the means , it would be nice if we could help American kids go to Space Camp . But I am not so sure , you know , why we borrow money from China to send kids in Pakistan to Space Camp in Alabama or to Dollywood -- you know , $ 250,000 . We also spent over a million dollars in Afghanistan doing an anti- drug program . Unfortunately , really , the drug problems in our country -- they grow it . They grow it like corn . It is a crop for them . The problem is the demand comes from us , but we spent a million dollars on public relations television programming in Afghanistan , and it was to convince the Afghanis not to use drugs . It was in English . So the vast majority of them could not understand or -- you know , most of them do not have television sets anyway . But this is the kind of thing that runs rampant throughout our government . So , you know , we talk about where would we find the resources to be a strong country again , to do the things that we could do to combat what happens in China . When we look at that , we say where could the money come from ? Well , we spend $ 50 billion a year in Afghanistan on the war . It has been going on 20 years . '\n",
    "rawrp5 = 'The war is 18 years past having any useful mission at all . The mission was over probably once the Taliban was defeated . There was still some mission for bin Laden , but it did not really require necessarily troops on the ground and nation-building . But we have been doing nation-building in Afghanistan . So our Nation crumbles , and we worry about China -- you know , the threat of the ascendance of China -- and yet , what are we doing ? We are borrowing money from China to build roads in Afghanistan . One of the things they did in Afghanistan years ago is they were going to build a natural gas gas station . This was to reduce the footprint of Afghanistan , the carbon footprint . So this is the absurdities we sometimes go to with climate change . This is a country that cooks their food on [ [ Page S3918 ] ] open fires often . This is a country with an average income of about $ 800 . Most people do not have a car . So what did we decide to do for Afghanistan to reduce their carbon footprint ? We decided to build a natural gas gas station So the natural gas gas station was built . It was supposed to cost $ 800,000 , but , you know , sometimes government is not that efficient so they had a few cost overruns -- 83 -- and it ended up costing $ 45 million . So my question , as I heard about this natural gas gas station , was , How many Americans have a car that runs on natural gas ? I think there are a handful of people who are really into it and have converted their cars into running on natural gas . There is a trucking company I am aware of . You know , it is not a bad idea , but it is a boneheaded , idiotic idea to build a gas station for natural gas vehicles in Afghanistan . They do not have cars , much less cars that run on natural gas , but we did it . We spent $ 45 million in Afghanistan on it . So my staff was over there looking at the waste , and they said to the military : Can we go see the famous natural gas gas station ? And as they -- they wanted to go see it . The marine said : Well , it would take two helicopters full of 30 marines in each helicopter to take you to the gas station , so we were told it was too dangerous , and we did not want to insist on something that was that dangerous . So we spent $ 45 million on a gas station that we cannot visit because it is too dangerous to serve up natural gas that nobody has a car that runs on natural gas . And my imagination goes to the gas station , and all I can imagine is sort of copper tubing sticking out of the ground , people running off with copper tubing . We built major highways over there , but one of the biggest problems is no cars , but the other problem they have in Afghanistan is people put their camels in their tents , and so if you ever want a car to go up and down the road , you got to shoo the camels and the tents off the road . We decided to build luxury hotels . See , this is part of our national defense . I think it was the Overseas Investment Bank , or whatever . We spent $ 90 million on a hotel in Kabul . Well , we did not quite get it finished . The contractor built about half the hotel . He built the shell of the hotel with no walls . I think he completed one room so he could send pictures home to say he was making progress . The hotel was never built . The guy ran off with , like , 60 million of the 90 million . The hotel still sits there , and guess what . It is a shell of a building . Our people are worried about the Taliban crawling up in it and shooting down into our Embassy . So the next thing is -- I am surprised it is not in this bill . It may be . Who knows what is in this bill . They need another 250 grand to destroy what is left of the hotel . The guy ran off with the money , and we have a shell of a building . It is a danger to our Embassy so we need to tear it down . So , really , you know , we should have an amendment to put more money in this bill to tear down the hotel -- the luxury hotel that we subsidized in Afghanistan . The list goes on and on and on . The frustration of the American people is , Why does it never change ? William Proxmire was talking about this in 1972 , studying why people fall in love . Why do people date ? The government is doing dating apps studying why people are happy or unhappy , studying whether or not , if you take a selfie of yourself smiling and look at it later in the day , whether or not that will make you happy . Seriously . Half a million here , a million there . Is there anything in this bill that will stop that from happening ? So it has been happening for 50 years . You know , we did not even authorize these things . They just go on and on . There is no oversight . You ask any questions , nobody wants to give you any answers , and it goes on and on . Now , this is not just one party . Both parties do it . Both parties are going to vote for this bill , but I guarantee , if you put up the different waste things that are going on in our government and you said that this is the Agency that is studying the mating call of the Panamanian frog , these are the Agencies studying whether someone sneezes on your food , you think the American people would be with you ? They are only with you because they do not know what you are doing today . They do not know that you are wasting more money ; that you are shoveling good money after bad . They do not know that this is more of the same ; that this has been going on for 50 years . And nobody , Republican or Democrat , is fixing the problem . We are just shoveling more money out the door . We are destroying our country . We are destroying our currency . Right now , it is a little bit at a time . It is coming through inflation , but inflation is out there . It is lurking . People are talking about it . But there is also another way you can destroy your country . If you look at the 20th century and you look at the decline in the stock market , most of it is in , like , 7 days . So those who think that we could not have a precipitous correction ; that there could not be a precipitous correction , where all of a sudden everybody wakes up in the marketplace and says `` Oh , my goodness . The emperor has no clothes  -- we are $ 28 trillion in debt , and we have companies that have , you know , 200-to-1 price-to-earnings ratio . We have companies that are worth hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars , and yet what is their profit ? Some of them do not make a profit . Is there going to be a day where people wake up and say : `` Oh , my goodness , the stock market . The emperor has no clothes ,  and there is a massive selloff ? I do not know . But I do worry that the stock market is grossly inflated . I do worry , when we pass out $ 1,400 checks , which we did not have , we give them to everybody , and what do the young people do with their checks ? Buy GameStop . So GameStop goes through the roof , makes no profit . It is a dying company , and it goes through the roof because everybody gets giddy on it because everybody has got all this free money . There is no free money . Ultimately , the $ 1,400 we gave to people will be lost as wages do not keep up with inflation . It happens even as we speak . Inflation has been low , but over the last decade , the dollar lost 17 percent of its purchasing power . Do you think everybody in America got a 17-percent gain ? See , this is sort of the difference between the seen and the unseen . Frederic Bastiat was a philosopher , parliamentarian in France in the 19th century , and he talked a lot about this . He wrote a book called `` The Law ,  and he talked about the seen and the unseen . It is also the intended and the unintended . People -- I call it the big heart , small brain syndrome of Washington . Everybody wants to help somebody . We have the same compassion . We want to help those out of work , but if you give people too much not to work , then they will not work . If people do not work for a long period of time , they will not be hired again . This was illustrated when we extended unemployment to 99 weeks . It was done out of compassion , but as we extended unemployment to 99 weeks , what happened ? Anybody who stayed out of work 99 weeks and came in looking for a job , if there was another worker that had been out of work less , guess who got hired . Every study showed this . So if an employer is faced with two employees , one has been out of work 10 weeks , one has been out of work 99 weeks , guess who gets hired . The one who has been out of work 10 weeks . So when you institutionalize unemployment , when you pay people more from the government not to work than to work , you get a permanent class of unemployed , and there comes a point when they are unemployable . What does that do to the people ? What does that do to a person ? I think our self-esteem is tied up in what we do for a living , and I think there is self-esteem in every job , from cleaning the floors , to designing a carpet , to creating the carpet , to laying bricks , to being a doctor or lawyer . Your self-esteem comes from being proud of your work . It comes from work . You can not get self-esteem without work , and you cannot be given self-esteem . We have some newfangled ideas in school that we just give it . You know , Johnny cannot spell , but we are going to pat him on the back and give him a [ [ Page S3919 ] ] trophy because it will help his self-esteem . No . You have to earn self- esteem . But if we get a whole class of people who do not work , it is a problem -- the lack of self-esteem , the worry and concern that come from this . The lack of what it takes to be a robust person is part of the problem with the sinking into despair and addiction that we have as a problem in our country . This is another waste project that comes out of our State Department . We fund the State Department for diplomacy . I am for that . But we end up funding things in the State Department , and you wonder if they are useful for diplomacy or whether they are just pork barrel politics . This is $ 850,000 that was given to a for-profit Afghan television station to support the development of a national cricket league . Really ? So our State Department , which -- you know , we have to pay Ambassadors . We have to pay Assistant Ambassadors . We have got to pay all the different personnel , those protecting the Ambassadors and our Embassies . We have to pay for Embassies , the electricity . All that stuff , we have to do . I am for that . Where do we get the money to pay for cricket ? Why is this the business of the U.S. Government ? But here is the point : Does it ever get better ? Does someone say `` My goodness . Someone stuck this little earmark in for the National Cricket League  ? Does someone ever say `` Oh my goodness . We did this ?  and we reform the process and never do it again ? No . We give them more money . Every year , every Agency in government gets more money . If you think there is a waste problem in government and you want to fix it , it will not get better if you give people more money . You would have to give them less . So what I would do is I would give everybody 99 percent of what they had last year -- if it is a terrible Agency like the National Science Foundation , I might give them 50 percent of what they had last year -- and I would say to them : Prove to me that you are not going to do this again . They were studying dating back in 1972 , and Proxmire lampooned them . Fifty years later , they are studying selfies . They have not learned their lesson . If you look at the process , they pick the people they want to approve their projects . You scratch my back ; I will scratch yours . You do cocaine studies ? Hey , me too . You approve my cocaine study ; I will approve yours . That is what goes on at the National Science Foundation . This one is kind of close to home . You may have seen it . We call it `` A Streetcar Named Waste .  It is about a couple blocks from the Capitol over on H Street . It is a streetcar they spent millions of dollars on . For years , there was nobody on it , and for years , it did not go anywhere . It was a streetcar to nowhere , basically . But we spent $ 1.6 million on this , and basically you could see it as basically a trolley car with nobody in it . It was sort of this nostalgia . It is one thing to preserve something , but it is another thing to create some sort of thing that has not existed for 50 years and nobody rides . And that cost us $ 1.6 million , and often you will see it sitting vacant and not in use at all . Now , we have decided that -- I do not even know why they even think they need this anymore because I think climate alarmism has really penetrated all of our education . But just in case there is a child in the country who is not afraid that the oceans will rise and cover the land and that we are all going to drown and that the polar bears are going to drown , we need to make sure they know it through a special video game . So we spent half a million dollars on a video app to try to convince our kids that the polar bears are drowning sometime soon and that the end of the world is around the corner . Will the Chair inform me how much time I have remaining ? '\n",

    "rawg = 'Mike GALLAGHER . Madam Speaker , I stand before you today in proud support of this bipartisan bill , which is a reflection of the hard work of both sides that went into this . This process remains some of the most gratifying work that we do in Congress and a testament to the way in which this institution can work when we put our mind to it . The FY22 NDAA includes a top-line budget that restores funding for shipbuilding , procurement , missile defense , and a number of other priorities that will help ensure the national defense of our great Nation . The bill that was voted out of committee continues to support and improve the lives of those who sacrifice for our country on a daily basis by authorizing a military basic pay raise of 2.7 percent . This bill reinforces the committee longstanding commitment to the military family by requiring the Department of Defense to increase parental leave , expands the in-home childcare pilot program , and improves support available to military families with special needs children . This bill also addresses the threat of COVID-19 by prohibiting the use of DOD funds to conduct research , including biomedical , infectious disease , and genomic research in China or with any entity controlled by the Chinese Communist Party . It requires DOD to report to Congress on the number of military personnel infected with coronavirus at the 2019 Military World Games in Wuhan , China , and requires DOD and the Director of National Intelligence to assess the involvement of the Chinese Communist Party in the origins of COVID-19 . I thank the chairman and ranking member for an outstanding bipartisan bill . I thank them both for their work on it , and I am proud to be a member of this committee . Let us do our duty . Let us support servicemembers , military families , and retirees . Let us pass this bill . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , at this time , I have no further speakers , and I reserve the balance of my time .'\n",
    "rawg2 = ' Madam Speaker , I stand before you today in strong support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 . This year NDAA includes a top-line budget that restores funding for shipbuilding , procurement , missile defense , and a number of other priorities that will help ensure the national defense of our great Nation . The NDAA continues to support and improve the lives of those who sacrifice for our country on a daily basis by authorizing a military basic pay raise of 2.7 percent . The bill reinforces the committee  longstanding commitment to the military family by requiring DOD to increase parental leave , expand the in-home childcare pilot program , it improves support available to military families with special needs children , and provides comprehensive reform of DOD  family violence prevention and response program . It also requires the Department to standardize the definition of professional military education across the joint force . It requires DOD to report to Congress on the number of military personnel infected with COVID-19 at the 2019 World Military Games in Wuhan , China . It increases funding for COVID-19 vaccine research , while providing $ 35 million for research and treatment of Havana syndrome . Madam Speaker , this is an outstanding NDAA . I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for their tireless efforts in working together to preserve the bipartisan spirit of this committee . I also want to thank the chairwoman of the Military Personnel Subcommittee that I work with , Ms. Speier . Madam Speaker , this is a bill we can all be proud of . '\n",

    "rawmr = ' Marco RUBIO . Mr. President , a year ago Saturday , the previous administration , the Trump administration , launched something called Operation Warp Speed . At that time , it was a $ 10 billion program by the government , and it was designed to incentivize pharmaceutical companies to invest in developing , researching , and producing effective treatments and a vaccine for a disease that was ravaging and continues to ravage the world today . Less than 4 months later , a new antibody treatment was beginning to save American lives and improving the outcomes of patients with COVID- 19 here in America . And less than 7 months after that Operation Warp Speed program began , Americans began receiving the first dose of two different and highly effective vaccines . Why did the government have to step in ? Why did the government have to provide the money ? Would not the market have solved this ? There was certainly a demand . There was certainly a need for it . In fact , I would argue that people probably would have paid whatever it took to get their hands on a vaccine and on new treatments given the level of desperation that existed in May of last year here and around the world . Yes , the market would have eventually developed the antivirals , would have developed the antibody treatments , and would have developed the vaccine . The market would have eventually done it without the government stepping in , in this dramatic way . But it would not have done it in the timing that we needed it . We needed it right away . Our economy was shut down . Children were not going to school . Workers had no jobs . Small businesses were being wiped out . Hospitals were being overrun , and people were dying . We were facing a global crisis and a national emergency . It was a moment that required urgent attention and the fastest results possible . So for the common good of our country , our government partnered with the private sector to reach a targeted end , one that served the interest of our country and our people . In short , we pursued `` industrial policy  and almost 1 year to the very day , it was announced that life in America is , slowly but steadily , returning to normal . I first spoke about the need for a 21st century American industrial policy well over a year before the pandemic hit . Let me tell you that for much of my adult life , much of the time I even paid attention to policy , `` industrial policy  was generally sort of a dirty phrase for me . Politically , I was raised capitalist orthodox . It is an economic faith grounded in the belief of less taxes and less government and more freedom . I still believe in less taxes and less government and more freedom , and my faith in capitalism has only grown because , unlike socialism , the market always produces the most efficient outcome and , usually , generally , invariably , the result of that is prosperity and opportunity . The free market -- capitalism -- has eradicated more poverty than all the socialist programs in the world combined . [ [ Page S2559 ] ] But the market is agnostic . It does not take into account the impact that an efficient outcome , a market outcome , would have on its people . Thus the market does not take into account its national interests . It is agnostic . We in public policy can not be agnostic . The job of those of us who serve in the American Government is to make decisions that are in the best interests of America and the people that we serve . I believe that , generally and invariably , that usually means supporting a vibrant system of free enterprise in which private businesses invest and innovate and produce , and government makes it easier for them to do that and gets out of the way . But what do we do , what should we do , when the market reaches the most efficient outcome and the most efficient outcome is one that is bad for America , bad for Americans , or does not meet a crisis at hand fast enough ? What is our role when we face such a crisis , when we must address one that has to be addressed faster than the market  ability to do it ? This is not a hypothetical question . It describes what we faced in May of last year , when Operation Warp Speed was announced , and it describes many of the important challenges we face today . Over the last 20 years -- maybe 25 years -- the market sent American factories and jobs to other countries . This was the most efficient decision to make because workers in other countries cost less , and so it lowered labor costs and increased profits . It was the market  decision . It was the efficient decision , but it destroyed the jobs of Americans . It shattered families . It gutted once-vibrant communities . Major American corporations headquartered here in the United States -- multinationals -- have allowed China to steal trade secrets and cheat on trade because , for them , gaining access to even a small sliver of the growing Chinese market of over a billion people led to profits . This , indeed , did create short-term profits and extravagant wealth for some , but in the process it began transforming America from a country that invents and makes things into one that increasingly just finances and buys them . It is , indeed , more efficient to make the active ingredients in many of our medicines in China . It is cheaper to do it . So , today , we find ourselves depending on China to produce the active ingredients in everything from acetaminophen , which is generic for Tylenol , all the way to blood thinners and everything in between . It was cheaper to buy rare-earth minerals from China -- it still is -- than to produce and mine our own . Today , we depend on them for almost 90 percent of these valuable metals that are needed not just for advanced electronics but for our own major weapons systems . We made the decision to allow Chinese companies free rein to own and to buy and to make money in America , almost without restrictions , because we are capitalists They , on the other hand , restrict and ban our businesses from doing work in China because they are nationalists . None of this is an accident . China has a plan . It has a plan to overtake America as the world  leading economic , technological , geopolitical , diplomatic , and military power . I do not say this to you based on some supersecret intelligence document or an educated guess . They put it on paper . They have written this out for everyone to see in 2015 . The Chinese Communist Party laid out a plan with a title called `` Made in China 2025 .  It basically is a plan to invest in and overtake us in 10 of the industries that will define the 21st century economy -- biomedicine , advanced technology , air and space , artificial intelligence , quantum computing , telecommunications , 5G , rail systems , ship building . They intend to lead the world in all of these areas , and they are executing on a plan to carry that out , and we have been complacent and distracted . So while China channels every element of their national power , every element that you can imagine -- while they channel all of it -- to dominate these key industries and to do it at our expense , we assume that our position in the world will continue on its own without having to do anything to maintain it . While China is pursuing economic and technological dominance , we find ourselves here busy canceling people , demanding the use of the right pronoun to describe people , or claiming that requiring a photo ID to vote is the return of a Jim Crow era . We have placed ourselves on the road of decline and humiliation , headed toward a world in which a totalitarian regime -- one guilty right now , as we speak , of committing genocide against Uighur Muslims -- becomes the leading power on the planet and relegating our country , America , into the status of a once great nation in decline . We do not need to abandon capitalism and embrace socialism to take on this challenge . I believe socialism would only accelerate the damage our decisions are doing to our country . We need capitalism , but it must be a capitalism geared toward promoting the national interest and the common good , where the private market drives our economic decisions . And in those instances where the market outcome is bad for our country , in those instances in which the market  most efficient outcome is one that is bad for our people , for our national security , for our national interests , bad for America -- in those instances -- what we need is targeted industrial policy to further the common good and to protect our people , our country , and our future . We need an industrial policy targeted not to every industry or to the one who hires the right lobbyist . No , we need an industrial policy like Operation Warp Speed , targeted to urgent national needs ; policies like my Medical Manufacturing , Economic Development , and Sustainability Act , which would help bring back our ability to make medicines in this country again , including in places like Puerto Rico that need the economic growth and jobs ; like the CHIPS Act we passed last year to make sure we never have to depend on China or any other country , for that matter , for semiconductors . In 2019 , well before the pandemic , I proposed modernizing the Small Business Administration and aligning its programs to the national interest , like my American Innovation and Manufacturing Act , which would incentivize private investment in small American manufacturers through the SBA . And even as we make these sorts of targeted industrial policy decisions , we need to make sure that we are protecting them from being stolen from us . One of the changes we need to make in the China bill that is now before the Senate is we need to have stronger protections against the research that we are funding from being stolen . First , more of this money should be invested through agencies like DARPA , as an example , which has very good safeguards in place . Second , we should prohibit any entity from receiving the funds called for in this bill if they receive China-based financial or in-kind support , or if they otherwise failed to disclose foreign funding in the past 10 years . Third , we should require certification that a potential recipient of the funding has sufficient protections in place to guard against IP theft and other threats from foreign governments before they were giving them the money . It would be something if we appropriate all this money for industrial policy , we invest it , and then we see it stolen . Fourth , we should prohibit Federal employees and contractors from participating in any foreign government talent recruitment program , and we should require Federal contractors to disclose any commercial ties they might have to the Communist Party in China . And , fifth , we should establish a system of outbound investment screening . Even if we are successful in preventing adversarial actors from acquiring Federal research dollars or intellectual property developed by it , there is nothing to stop nationless corporations from simply buying the IP and using it to develop capacities to benefit China and hurt our interests . This is an important moment , I think , one that will define the remainder of the century . When the book about the 21st century is written , it will have a few chapters about a lot of different things . But that book is going to be about the relationship between China and the United States and what happened , and what happened is in very many ways being decided right now . [ [ Page S2560 ] ] We must ensure that our public policies are aligned to the urgent challenges of our time . Our job here is to promote the common good and to defend the national interest . By and large , that is a free enterprise , capitalist economy that will produce the innovation , the investments , and all of the things necessary to make that possible . Yet , in those instances in which a national need is urgent , in which the outcome that the market has delivered is harming our country and its long-term future , we have an obligation to act on the common good . We should not allow orthodoxy or policies that made a lot of sense in the 1980s -- a very different world from today -- to stand in the way of the sorts of targeted government-private partnerships needed : the kinds of partnerships that gave us a vaccine that is bringing us back to normal ; the kind of partnership that will allow us to tackle the challenges we face now so that the 21st century will ultimately be an American century and so that our leadership in these key industries that will define the century is neither endangered nor lost . I yield the floor . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The Senator from Texas . '"

    "rawcs = 'Chuck SCHUMER . Mr. President , now , speaking of bipartisan legislation , today the Commerce Committee will begin marking up the Endless Frontier Act , one of the most significant investments in American innovation in generations . The bill will be at the core of comprehensive legislation to address American competitiveness and security in the 21st century . Once again , for the information of the Senate , it is my intention for the Senate to consider and finish competitive legislation before the end of the month . There have been productive bipartisan talks over the last week to improve the Endless Frontier Act . This is an issue I have worked on with my friend the Republican Senator from Indiana for the past few years . He has been a great help , a great partner , and I appreciate his work . And , of course , Senator Cantwell , our chairman of the Commerce Committee , and Senator Wicker , our ranking member , have come together . And everyone had to give a bit here , there , and everywhere , but I think we have a strong bill that should get strong bipartisan support . The simple truth is very simple . The Endless Frontier Act is legislation our country desperately needs . For decades after the Second World War , our country led the world in science and technology , from healthcare to computers , from telecommunications to manufacturing , to defense . Our workforce brought these innovations to the global economy , and it produced more than half a century of prosperity . People in the last 50 years , from 1950 to 2000 , thought the future was going to be better even than the present , and it created the usual American optimism . But things have changed , and one of the things that has changed is years of Federal investment in sciences , and they have exposed long-term weak spots -- serious weak spots -- in our economic competitiveness . This could hurt us dramatically in the next 50 years . The longer we put off investing in sciences , the likelier it is that other countries , like China but others too , will overtake America as the global leader in innovation , and that will have profound consequences for our economy , our national security , even the future of human liberty , and it will have a lot to do with whether Americans believe that the future economically will be better for them than the present , which is part of the American hallmark and trademark , our sunny optimism , which we must restore . There has been a sourness in the land lately . It is our mission to restore it . So to take the initiative back , the Endless Frontier Act provides $ 100 billion for basic research through the National Science Foundation , focusing on the critical technologies of tomorrow , where we have to stay the leader : AI , advanced manufacturing , renewable energy , quantum computing , cyber security , 5G , battery storage , and so much more . This bill will nurture tech labs and tech hubs across the country in places where they are not now . We have to spread the wealth . The clock is ticking on the need to make these critical investments . The Chinese Communist Party has gone to extraordinary lengths to steal a generation of American intellectual property and cheat their way to innovating and economic growth . We do not , we definitely do not -- Democrats , Republicans , liberals , conservatives do not want a future where the Chinese Communist Party dictates the global order and how the world uses 5G , artificial intelligence , quantum computing . That is why the Endless Frontier Act is resoundingly bipartisan . We already have six cosponsors from each side -- six Democrats , six Republicans -- because these issues affect the future of our entire country . I greatly look forward to the good work that Chair Cantwell and the Commerce Committee will do to advance the bill this week . '\n",
    "rawcs2 = 'Mr. President , first , I , too , would like to thank Senators Cantwell and Wicker for an amazing , bipartisan job ; and Senators Menendez and Risch , another great bipartisan contribution . All the Members -- just about every Member has contributed to this bill . I do want to single out two of my staff members who just slaved over this bill relentlessly , and that is Mike Kuiken and Jon Cardinal . Mike is there . I do not know if Jon is here . But they deserve tremendous kudos for what they did . Without them I do not think we would have had a bill , to be honest with you -- and everybody else , all the other staffs who worked so hard . Now , this is a quote from Dr. Vannevar Bush : `` Without scientific progress , no amount of achievement in other directions can insure our health , prosperity , and security in the modern world .  That was Dr. Vannevar Bush , the head of the U.S. Office of Scientific Research , writing in 1945 . His report to President Truman was titled : `` Science -- The Endless Frontier  -- an inspiration to the legislation we considered today . In the wake of Dr. Bush  report , we created the National Science Foundation . We funded the National Laboratories . We split the atom . We spliced the gene . We landed a man on the Moon . We unleashed the internet . We generated 75 years of American prosperity and fostered an innate sense of optimism in the American spirit . We face a challenge now -- in this century -- to replicate the success of the previous one . But the Federal Government  commitment to science , unfortunately , has waned . As a percentage of GDP , we spend less than half as much as the Chinese Communist Party on basic research . We rely on foreign nations to supply critical technologies that we invented , like semiconductors . That sunny American optimism has flickered as well . The world is more competitive now than at any time since the end of the Second World War . If we do nothing , our days as the dominant superpower may be ending . We do not mean to let those days end on our watch . We do not mean to see America become a middling nation in this century . We mean for America to lead it . Passing this bill -- now called the U.S . Innovation and Competition Act -- is the moment when the Senate lays the foundation for another century of American leadership . Let me say that again . This bill could be the turning point for American leadership in the 21st century , and for that reason , this legislation will go down as one of the most significant bipartisan achievements of the U.S. Senate in recent history . Around the globe , authoritarian governments believe that squabbling democracies like ours cannot unite around national priorities . They believe that democracy itself is a relic of the past and that by beating us to emerging technologies , they -- many of the meritocracies -- will be able to reshape the world in their own image . Well , let me tell you something . I believe they are wrong . I believe that this legislation will enable the United States to outinnovate , outproduce , and outcompete the world in the industries of the future . I believe that the strongly bipartisan work on this bill has revealed that in this Chamber , we all believe that another American century lies on the horizon . I urge my colleagues to vote yes . I yield the floor . '\n",

    "rawmb = 'Marsha BLACKBURN . Madam President , over the past week , the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas has launched more than 3,000 rockets at civilian targets in Israel . Violent mobs have taken over the streets of Jerusalem , and even seasoned veterans of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict have expressed shock at the intensity of the violence . This is not normal . This is not the Middle East version of the Resistance . This is terrorism . Still , pro-Hamas activists have flooded the media with Instagram-friendly content condemning Israel for defending itself and questioning the legitimacy of Israel  very existence , which is an argument that in any other context would bring all hell down on the person foolish enough to say it out loud . The level of denial and misinformation about what is happening in Israel and why it is happening is appalling . Nearly every single member of the United Nations Security Council embarrassed themselves this weekend by embracing a generic draft statement condemning the violence but refusing to acknowledge the hundreds of Hamas rockets that started it . The U.N. has a shameful history of ignoring threats and violence against Israel , but rarely in recent memory has the Security Council so blatantly regurgitated anti-Israel propaganda while Israeli civilians cower in fear under persistent rocket fire . Thankfully , the U.S. mission blocked the statement  release , but I think it is important -- important -- to inject a little reality into the ongoing discussion . First , we must acknowledge that Israel has the absolute right to defend itself , no matter the state of their relations with the Palestinian Authority . There is a world of difference between a state- sponsored terrorist attack on a civilian population and action taken to stop that attack . We have a responsibility to counter the dangerous argument that because Hamas currently lacks the weapons capability to win this battle , Israel must stand by and allow terrorists to slaughter civilians . Second , I would encourage all of my colleagues to join me in making it clear that the United States is and will remain Israel  closest friend and ally . We will continue to assist with the development and production of advanced missile defense systems like the Iron Dome . We will not step away from that obligation simply because celebrity influencers would rather witness a slaughter than a proportionate response to mass terror . Last , it is important to acknowledge that this violence is a symptom of a much more serious disease . Hamas terrorists may be the ones launching rockets at civilians , but it is Iran , the world  leading state sponsor of terror , that is paying for it . That is right , Madam President -- it is Iran , the world  leading state sponsor of terrorism , that is footing the bill for these attacks . When we provide assistance and support to Israel , we are not just [ [ Page S2538 ] ] protecting an ally ; we are containing the destructive influence of our most belligerent adversary in the Middle East . This month , the Biden administration traveled to Vienna to negotiate sanctions relief with Iranian officials . Since then , President Biden has also spoken to Prime Minister Netanyahu and reaffirmed Israel  right to defend itself from these attacks . However , I would take this opportunity to remind my Democratic colleagues that the United States designated Hamas as a terrorist organization more than 20 years ago . That is right . For the past two decades , we have recognized Hamas as a terrorist organization . As a rule , we do not provide them assistance of any kind . They are a terrorist organization . But by opening the door to sanctions relief for Iran , we can not help but enrich a regime that will not stop until it destroys Israel . That is their goal . We know it because they have told us that is their goal . We must not provide sanctions relief to Iran or give quarter to any regime that allies itself with this evil . It is my hope that all Americans will take some time this week to just unplug and think about this and reflect and then pray -- pray that reason and wisdom will prevail as we seek an end to this outbreak of violence and the defeat of this terrorist group that wants to destroy the nation of Israel . Tennessee Madam President , this weekend , we had a positive development in the status of the I-40 bridge that connects West Memphis , AR , and Memphis , TN . Just as a reminder , last week , inspectors discovered a crack in one of the steel beams supporting the bridge . The crossing was immediately closed to all vehicle and barge traffic . On Friday morning , the Coast Guard reopened the stretch of Mississippi River that runs under the bridge , but the bridge itself remains closed indefinitely . Now , a lot of armchair experts have decided to sound off with the argument that this closure wo not affect local economies , but with all due respect , those making this argument really should spend a little bit more time out in the real world . This part of Middle America that we are talking about is an incredibly important part of our Nation  domestic supply chain . We have a 15-mile stretch along the Mississippi River , and that houses 68 waterfronted facilities . Thirty-seven of those facilities are terminal facilities moving products such as petroleum , tar , asphalt , cement , steel , coal , salt , fertilizers , rock and gravel , and grains . Shipping companies and cross-country trucking companies depend on the I-40 crossing , and so do the local grocery stores , industrial facilities , restaurants , retail outlets that purchase the cargo , and , of course , our Nation  farmers . Commercial trucking constitutes 25 percent of all traffic that crosses the I-40 bridge . The river traffic that flows beneath the bridge is just as important . When the Coast Guard reopened that stretch of the Mississippi , they had to juggle 60 vessels hauling more than 1,000 barges . Yes . We had a little traffic jam in the Mississippi River . It is amazing to me how quickly a problem like this does turn into a bottleneck . Tennessee and Arkansas transportation officials are still working out a timeline for repairs , but as of now , the trucking industry is preparing for a downward spiral . According to the Arkansas Trucking Association , this could cost operators and their customers more than $ 2 million a day , which is an amount that the industry actually can not absorb . This means that the delay could end up costing consumers an additional $ 2 million a day . And depending on what they are buying , they could also see empty shelves due to a supply chain interruption . Meanwhile , the Biden administration is putting all their energy and focus into checking items off of a decades-old wish list of social programs . They put forward an infrastructure package worth more than $ 2 trillion that wastes about two-thirds of this total pricetag on projects that have nothing to do with infrastructure , nothing to do with making sure that major bridges and thoroughfares are safe and open or expanding broadband access or making sure that parents in rural Tennessee can get their kids to school without worrying that a rainstorm will flood the road on the way to town . This is making the American people feel so incredibly unsettled and very frustrated , and Tennesseans are pretty nervous about the future . If I could give the President one piece of advice , it would be this : If you want to waste time peddling Green New Deal policies or expanding social safety nets , admit it -- just admit it . Call it what it is . Do not call it infrastructure and then turn around and throw pocket change at actual infrastructure problems that need to be addressed right now . That mislabeling makes it look like you are trying to pull a fast one over the American people , and it makes the American people believe that you really do not care . And that is a dangerous message to send in the middle of a traumatic pandemic recovery , especially considering that prices are already on the rise . We see it in utilities . We see it at the gas pump . We see it in the packaged snacks we purchase for the children  Sunday school class . Even basics in the produce section at the grocery store are beginning to get out of reach . It is affecting basic nutrition . This is the Biden surcharge . We are paying a premium just to live from the moment our feet hit the floor in the morning to the time we brush our teeth and get into bed at night . The barebones cost of living is going up thanks to these reckless spending priorities . My Democratic colleagues need to understand that a government subsidy can not save a family from that kind of hit to their monthly budget , affecting everything from the moment their feet hit the floor in the morning to the time they brush their teeth and go to bed in the evening . The Biden administration is creating a perfect storm of income insecurity , shortages , and the uneasiness that comes when Americans see more month at the end of their money than money at the end of the month . They know how to manage their budget , and they know what they have to do when prices creep up 25 cents , $ 1 or $ 2 at a time . Their instinct is not to reach out to the Federal Government for help ; their instinct and their action is to cut back on the extras and to prepare for harder times ahead . The only way to avoid this even now is to make prudent , targeted investments in economic recovery , supply chain security , cyber security , and , yes , actual real infrastructure projects . The American people can not afford all the extras that are on the Democratic Party  wish list . Their income ca not keep up with the inflation that is hitting their pocketbook every single day of the week . And they really are concerned with what will happen when those trend lines cross and inflation heads north every single day .'\n",

    "rawmc = 'Maria CANTWELL . Mr. President , we come to the floor today after a lot of hard work by the Commerce Committee to pass out the Endless Frontier bill last week -- 24 to 4 . I know my colleagues from the committee will be out here to speak on this important legislation , as will the majority leader , Senator Schumer , who authored this important legislation , and our colleague from Indiana , Senator Young . We thank them for kick-starting what is a very important national discussion about how much we should be investing in research and development or what I would say is American ingenuity or , to put it a little more simply , I just say American know-how , because we are a nation of people who know how to innovate , who know how to use science to transform our economy , and we have done it over and over and over again . I do not know . Maybe it came with , in getting in a boat and coming all the [ [ Page S2753 ] ] way across the ocean , you had to be an adventurer to begin with . If you had to settle the frontier , you had to be innovative in your own right . If you had to continue to expand our country , you had to have a great ability to take risks in order to calculate and move forward . Yet , somehow , in the United States of America , we are blessed with ingenuity in our DNA . We as a nation are a nation that has figured out that if we continue to partner together with those great , creative minds , that the investment by both the public sector and the private sector and through our universities and now our community colleges and now research centers -- that we can grow our economy , compete on an international level , and protect opportunity for future Americans . So it has been many eras of innovation . When I think about it , I think about Thomas Edison and the light bulb , I obviously think about Henry Ford and automobiles , and in my part of the world , we think about Bill Boeing and aviation . Innovation is so much part of our DNA that I do not think we sometimes absorb the littler things that we might not know about . People probably do not know about Nathan Stone Stubblefield , a Kentucky inventor who in 1902 demonstrated the first wireless transmission of communication using magnets . I know we have a big wireless industry today , but people probably do not know that , in 1902 , a Kentucky inventor basically helped to turn the page on a new generation of technology . People probably do not know that a Louisiana professor , J. Lawrence Smith , in 1850 , invented the microscope . Think about how much that led to the important discussions of science and healthcare for us as a nation . People probably do not know that , in Indiana , a State police officer invented the breathalyzer test , a gentleman named Robert Borkenstein , who basically just said , `` We do not know what is happening here , '' and he introduced and created the breathalyzer test . That is what America is . America is the spirit of know-how and getting things done . In fact , a report read : Americans prioritize being a world leader in scientific achievements more than other global [ communities ] . That is from the Pew Research Center report by Cary Funk and several other authors last September . The report goes on to read : [ S ] even in ten Americans believe it is very important for the United States to be a leader in scientific achievements . Clearly , what makes us different than other nations is that we are willing to put significant American tax dollars on the table to ensure that the national investment , the research in science , and the development of our ecosystem take place . That investment is matched with a good education system , capital formation , and , as I said , private sector investments in research and development . All of that has continued to make us the world leader in science and technology innovation . It also helps us create job growth here at home . The question before us today is , How much research and development should our government be doing given how important th practical sciences and engineering are to the next generation of Americans ? We are here to discuss this proposal by Senators Schumer and Young , who , as I said , have been working on this concept for years because , no doubt , we have fallen off the pace -- that is to say , the pace of scientific research investment at least as a percentage of the GDP . Even though President Bush , in his second term , tried to signal the importance of this investment , he issued a report basically calling the American Competitiveness Initiative the leading world innovation agenda . That was in February of 2006 . In fact , at that time , President Bush said : [ T ] he role of government is not to create wealth ; the role of our government is to create an environment in which the entrepreneur can flourish , in which minds can expand , in which technologies can reach new frontiers . George Bush had it right . He knew that this competitiveness issue was starting to challenge us from a competitive perspective , and he knew that we needed to make a bigger investment . Unfortunately , with the two attempts that we had -- the America COMPETES Act in 2007 and the America COMPETES Act in 2010 -- it really was a goal by us to basically double the NSF budget within a 7-year window . While we started out in the right direction , we had a huge economic downturn , and these goals were not met . If we had kept our promises to these science agencies , we would have invested $ 80 billion more in innovation investments over the last 14 years than we have done today . The challenge that we face now is that , after decades of not living up to what had been outlined for America COMPETES , we now know that it is an environment in which we are facing much more aggressive competition . We have to think about the lack of investment that we did not realize in the context of how long it takes to do technology breakthroughs . Look at just one example , the internet as we know it today . Literally , in the 1960s , the ARPANET was first talked about . It took us to the 1990s to really , with the University of Illinois and Marc Andreessen , to affect what we would later know as hypertext links and a browser . Today , what it means to us is more than $ 2 trillion annually to our economy . When you think about the investments we are asking our colleagues to make today , we have to consider that , in fact , Federal dollars for R & D is near its lowest point in 60 years as a percentage of the GDP . I cannot say that we are going to discover the next internet , but I can say that , if we continue to underinvest in this , we will be shortchanging generations of innovation . There is no doubt that key investments in research and development in other parts of the world are certainly getting attention . Since 2000 , research and development in China has grown by 1,600 percent ; in Taiwan and Korea by 400 percent ; while , in the United States , just by 150 percent . That is in a 20-year window of looking at this issue . Americans believe that competition is good , and we believe that competition helps to drive innovation . So you will not find me as one on the floor who is obsessed about other nations as much as giving a perspective here about what the world market opportunity represents . If we are not making the investments here in science and technology and innovation , not only are we missing opportunities in our own country , we are missing opportunities around the globe . The rest of the Nation , in an information age , is not going to sit by idly , so we have to think about how we move ahead on critical technology that helps us in all sectors of our economy -- how it helps us with supply chains and , certainly , how it helps us with national security . What we are talking about here , with this bill proposed by our colleague Leader Schumer and Senator Young , is more than a doubling of NSF  budget in 5 years ; it is the start of trying to catch up . It is also a $ 17 billion investment in energy innovation -- a key sector of our economy in which we need to make continued transformation . That represents a 28-percent increase in some of the projects from the Office of Science and things like ARPA-E that could see investment . What we are also investing in , which our colleagues were very adamant about and very convincing , is a new tech directorate -- that is to say that our research is very good with basic and very good with applied but that we actually have to get better with the user implementation of our science and spur more innovation in a more rapid fashion . So we are investing , between this new tech directorate and tech hubs , nearly $ 39 billion to help stimulate the faster translation of our advancements into real innovation . This is something the committee thought long and hard about , and we took testimony from experts who have worked on innovation issues for many years . In this bill , we also increase the protection of intellectual property from our universities . We are helping our universities do better tech transfer but also protect their intellectual property . In an information age , when so much is published online , if other nations , hungry for development , can read our research and act an effect on it because we have not patented it , then we need to do a better job of patenting our innovations and helping our universities . [ [ Page S2754 ] ] Our universities are unbelievable research institutions , and helping them spend more time on tech transfer is something that we have done in the Pacific Northwest . A new program ushered in there literally led to 20 startups from research that had been done but just had not been translated into new areas . We also are trying to help get more regional diversity to our research and investment dollars . There are about 25 States in our Nation that previously qualified for a program that says they should get a share of research dollars . This legislation says all the money being spent here , 20 percent of it should go to that , what is called EPSCoR efforts , which is expanding research and development into those States . And for the first time , we will have over at NSF an office of diversity -- an office to focus on the lack of women and minorities in science and to make real progress on this issue . People see the chart behind me , and , yes , it is no mistake , the picture we picked . The point here is that we know from NSF  own research that we cannot be passive about this . Literally , the University of Washington got an NSF grant that helped them study why we are not making more progress with women and minorities in science and innovation , and they came back with : It cannot be passive . You cannot just put dollars on the table for STEM . You cannot just put a few programs in place . It has to be an active approach to changing many aspects to the way we educate in science . I am very proud of the University of Washington on this point because they made changes , and now of those who are teaching in what are considered STEM sciences at the University of Washington , 70 percent of them are women or people of color . So we have changed what the face of teaching science looks like at the University of Washington , and now we have to change some of the criteria and curriculum so that we can continue to attract more people . This bill is a very good step in that direction . So what are we trying to achieve ? We are trying to achieve what NSF Director Panchanathan is saying . He is saying that we need , in this next decade and in decades to come , innovation everywhere , tied to opportunity everywhere , tied to our universities . That is what we are trying to do in advancing this legislation . We processed over 100 amendments in committee and a broad range of input from our colleagues . We will , I am sure , here in regular order process many more , but , hopefully , these amendments and more of the substance of this underlying bill we will go into in detail . We have to remember what our goals are with this investment -- to stay competitive , to create future jobs , to help our economy by unleashing innovation , to protect our national security , and do what Americans know how to do best -- that is , use that ingenuity to help create a better future . I will see if my colleagues want to speak , but we will be coming back to expand on many other layers of this legislation . We will be back to talk about semiconductors . We will be back to talk about the new tech directorate . We will be back to talk about NASA funding . We will be back . And that reminds me . If anybody at home is saying , `` Well , you know , OK , that was interesting ; I do not really know about this ; what is American innovation ? '' just go and Google two things . You can either look at SpaceX rocket return , which they did in 2015 , or Blue Origin . In both of those -- the New Shepherd and the Falcon , two different approaches -- there are literally engineers who said : If we are going to go to space , if we are going to go to the Moon , if we are going back to the Moon and go to Mars , we need to figure out how to have returnable rockets . Just go Google those two clips , and you will see alive and well the spirit of American ingenuity when those engineers see that rocket returning from outer space and reland because they have pulled off an incredible achievement . You will see jubilant joy and excitement over that accomplishment . I guarantee you , we will not see everything that this bill will unleash , but I guarantee you it will unleash things that will deliver that kind of excitement for Americans in the future , and we will have to be very thankful that this Congress set the record straight on the level of investment we need to achieve to keep us competitive .

    "rawmc2 ='Mr. President , I come to follow my colleague from Texas to talk about the very issue that he brought up , which is where is America going with semiconductor manufacturing , design , and development . On this last point , I am pretty sure we see things differently . I am pretty sure that the majority -- probably all of the Democrats would be enthusiastic about supporting both manufacturing in the United States as well as making sure that if Federal dollars are used , prevailing wage should be applied . I am sure we will differ on that point . But I think that we are , at least on our side of the aisle , supportive of this concept that chip fabrication , chip manufacturing in the United States of America is an important sector and that we are facing a chip shortage and that we should do something about it . If you think about it , semiconductors are like the oil of the 21st century . They have become an essential aspect . They can be found in children  toys , in appliances , computers , cell phones , our telecommunications networks , and advanced national security technology , as my colleague was mentioning . They enable healthcare , artificial intelligence applications , financial services , and certainly in the area of defense . They have transformed how we communicate , how we learn , how we socialize . Yet they are so complex and manufacturing so expensive , it can cost anywhere from $ 5 to almost $ 20 billion -- $ 20 [ [ Page S3847 ] ] billion is one number I have heard -- just to build these facilities . This is why this issue has become so important . The United States has had strong leadership in the semiconductor area , but massive investments from other nations put us at a disadvantage when it comes to manufacturing . They are subsidizing and getting tax benefits up to 40 percent to build in Korea than in the United States of America . The Endless Frontier Act tries to address that because it really is a national security and telecommunications policy In the 1990s , the United States produced over 37 percent of the global chips supply . As you know , here in the United States , we have 48 percent of the world  aircraft production , but now with these challenges , as we look at the chip supply , they are down to 12 percent . I noticed in the Wall Street Journal they said : Why do we care ? Why do we care ? They basically are saying that chips in fabrication have become a commodity and that we do not have to worry about it anymore . As long as we are winning on the design side , we do not care where it is manufactured . Well , if you ask me , that is so 1980s -- I mean , the idea that you could design a product here and then have it manufactured somewhere else . Maybe that works with shoes or outdoor clothing , but it does not work with something as sophisticated and changing as a high-tech innovation product like semiconductors . In fact , I would say , if you really think that type of thinking works , just look at what happened . It is really pro-COVID thinking . We thought we could have the design done here and , basically , some of these devices that we use here , like ventilators , we will just produce them overseas . What could possibly go wrong ? Well , we figured out what could go wrong . If we are not manufacturing ventilators here in the United States , something could go wrong , and it did . The question is , What is going to go wrong if we do not manufacture chips in the United States of America ? The thing I do not think that the Wall Street Journal quite got right is that they do not understand that in today  innovation cycle , having a cluster of design , of manufacturing , of supply chain , of customers -- everybody working together is the new way to have an economic advantage . In fact , there is a recent study done by a Chicago research organization . I am going to read from this report . Basically , it is all about clusters and why clusters are so important : An industry cluster is a group of firms , related stakeholders , and supportive institutions that gain productive advantages from close geographic proximity and related economies of scale . As groups of related industries grow and develop , clustering can help lower business costs and increase the extent of benefits of specialization . Deeper labor pools , better access to customers and suppliers , knowledge spillover -- these and other advantages are derived from an environment of balanced competition and collaboration . I could go on . I will submit it for the Record . That is what is happening with semiconductors . The Asian market has , basically , now become the epicenter for this level of production , and the question is , Are we just going to forgo that and end up , basically , with not 12 percent of market share here but 6 percent of market share ? Then our suppliers are going to continue to go where the investments and the energy and the ideas are . That is why in the United States of America , where we still have clusters in various parts of the United States -- my colleague from Texas knows this well because he has a cluster in Texas . My colleague from Oregon , who was out here earlier , knows because they have a cluster there . There are clusters in places like Arizona . This is about whether the United States of America is going to continue to make this investment ourselves . Chips are essential to our national security and to telecommunications . In 1990 , we produced over 37 percent of global chip supply , and we need to continue to make sure that we are going to be an investor in chip fabrication today . Today , as I said , we are at an inflection point because of what is happening in a global basis . According to Goldman Sachs , 169 industries in the United States have products with embedded semiconductors , and there will be a 20-percent shortfall of components needed for those products . Last month , Caterpillar , headquartered in Illinois , said it anticipated the chip shortage impairing its ability to meet growing demand of construction and mining equipment . We are not just talking about kids gaming consoles or computers . We are talking about many sectors of our economy that depend on this . National security experts argue that if there were a greater trade war or military conflict , the United States would not be able to fill its demand for chips for national security and critical infrastructure needs . That means people like car manufacturers , appliance manufacturers -- if you think about 5G and new technology -- the post-pandemic economy will not be able to keep moving forward . The shortage also forced the auto sector to cut 27,000 jobs in April alone . Earlier this year , General Motors temporarily shut down three North American plants due to the shortage . Ford cut back Michigan production of F-150s and the popular Explorer . And Dodge is reducing worker schedules in a Nevada plant producing the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango . These are having real-life impacts on us today . The question is , We had a ripple of this just because of COVID . What if we had a ripple of this because somebody decided not to supply things to us ? These are things we have to worry about just in a national security perspective . You have to worry about whether we are going to get a supply chain that we can depend on . We really are at an inflection point . We are at an inflection point where we need to do something about this sector . One of the issues also is that chip fabrication and private R & D make huge investments . What we are talking about here represents a very small R & D investment partnership with the private sector as it relates to this . We are talking about trying to get more manufacturing jobs here in the United States . My colleague was just discussing this sector , overall , and one of the things that people should think about -- and I am pretty sure people at home will not be able to see this -- but these jobs in production and in various aspects of design and even on some of the other aspects , even in management and computer , these are all well-paying jobs . These are jobs that , literally , are the types of jobs we want to be producing in the United States . I heard this story about Idaho . Micron , a big company that used to be a major chip fabrication -- they are still doing chip fabrication -- but the number of jobs in Boise , ID , has fallen off , probably in the thousands , because this production has gone to other places . Now we are replacing them with call center jobs . The question is whether we are going to make this investment in a key technology critical to our national security -- critical to a lot of applications of the technology future , whether it is 5G or AI or various things -- and whether we are going to be a competitor in this area of a supply chain and cluster that continues to innovate . We know for a fact that semiconductor jobs in the production area are literally $ 94,000 a year . That is why we are fighting for this because it is a sector , in just the production end , that is high-paying jobs . So are we going to spend time letting things go overseas and basically saying , `` OK , they will allow us to have call centers , '' or are we going to fight for these high-paying jobs in the semiconductor space that we know will help us maintain our expertise and skill in the United States ? I ask my colleagues to just think about the fact that this notion that we design something here and ship it overseas for cheap production does not fit this bill . That is not what we need to do to maintain competitiveness , in the information age , on something as important as semiconductors . I think our history is rich with people like Thomas Edison and the Edison Park , which is what we established in New Jersey , or Menlo Park , or what now exists in Seattle or in various places . People get that innovation happens in clusters . So , if we are going to innovate , we have to make sure the United States is attracting this investment . We have to make sure that we are doing this here , on our shores , with the expertise and support . [ [ Page S3848 ] ] A lot of my colleagues might say : Well , do you know what ? Let us just have the private sector do this R & D . As I said , the private sector spends a lot on R & D . In fact , we think the private sector spends about $ 377 billion a year on R & D . Yet , as we know , R & D is not just done by the private sector for its specific interest . Basic science and lots of advanced research and applied science are done by the United States . That is why this bill is plussing up this number here from the National Science Foundation . We had discussions here about plussing up the number from the Department of Energy . Obviously , we had a vote in the Senate of even increasing the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and its dollars . What works about the United States of America is that we are an ecosystem . We are not a top-down . It is not like we are basically the government , saying : This is what is going to be done . We create an ecosystem that is really based on American know-how -- our ingenuity in how to get things done . What we are asking for , as it relates to not only NSF funding in order to continue the work of R & D as it relates to semiconductors , is also to make sure that we are going to continue the focus of manufacturing and design and R & D and development and clustering and supply chain and companies working together . I know how important this is because , in the Seattle area , in Washington State , we are a leader in aerospace technology . We are 49 percent , in the United States , of aerospace manufacturing . If you do not keep manufacturing , do you think the supply chain will stay in Seattle ? Do you think the supply chain would stay in Seattle forever -- all of those companies ? We have hundreds of companies that make products for Boeing . Do you think they would stay there if it were not there ? They will end up moving where the manufacturing is . That is what the information age is about , and it is certainly about that when it comes to technology products . The technology products are developed faster , quicker , and with the innovation and the input from their customers . That is why , if you look at these centers around the United States , they are also the places at which you will find the biggest users of this technology . They are there , and they are there because they want to be close to their customers . They want to understand their customers needs . They want to have interaction . They want to have collaboration . That is what innovation is today . Innovation is doing design and manufacturing close together . That is how we win . That is why we need to pass this legislation as it relates to an investment in chip design and manufacturing R & D and so we continue to attract manufacturing in the United States . Back to my colleague from Texas , who I know agrees with this principle in an underlying way , when the Federal Government wants to make an investment in actual construction , we say that we should apply prevailing wage . I have talked to many of these people in the semiconductor manufacturing-design space . They say : Do you see how expensive it is to do these plans ? Do you see how expensive the equipment is ? It is very expensive ; so we need the best workforce . So guess what . We pay prevailing wage . So we are saying , because we are putting Federal dollars on the table , we should pay prevailing wage . They think we should also pay prevailing wage . I am not speaking for them , but , in general , they feel like that is when they get their best product . I know where my side of the aisle is . We are going to be here to make an investment in this particular sector . We are going to figure out how to be competitive against Asia in semiconductor manufacturing . We are going to continue , as Andy Grove said , to be paranoid because we know that this is a changing landscape , and we are going to follow our colleagues who have made these decisions and make an investment for the future . I ask our colleagues to turn down the motion to strike the underlying bill , as the underlying bill already has this provision in it , and let us get about this business of waiving a budget point of order and deciding to make the investment that we need to make to be competitive in a key sector of the U.S. economy . If we do that , I guarantee you we will be well-positioned to continue to move forward , and our national security will be more secure because we will have made this decision . I yield the floor .

    "rawmc3 = 'Madam President , I come to the floor , hopefully today will be the day we wrap up debate on the America Competes-Endless Frontier legislation now known as the USICA , United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021 . We come to talk about this now , primarily because we know that the research dollars invested today are going to decide the jobs of the future . And we know that we all believe a significant increase in the investment in research and development dollars will help us spur innovation , continue to help us compete , and continue to be competitive in key sectors of our economy that are so important to us . We know that we have been having this debate literally now for more than a decade , starting with President Bush  2006 report saying America needed to invest more in the National Science Foundation . And at the time , I am pretty sure we thought we were in a track meet where our competitor was maybe half a lap behind us I am pretty sure now , as the decade has moved on , we are looking over our shoulder and realizing that the competition is gaining . So we need to make this investment in research and development to stay competitive , to grow jobs for tomorrow , and solve some of our most pressing problems , whether that is climate change , national security on cyber issues , or the advent and usage of artificial intelligence and what that will mean both for our opportunities and for our challenges . So we are making a renewed commitment to the National Science Foundation . I thank my colleagues again , Senator Schumer and Senator Young , for [ [ Page S3975 ] ] their innovative legislation . They are telling us a couple of things . They are saying , one , invest more money in research and development , so this bill not only increases the NSF budget , it increases DOE  budget and increases the Defense Advanced Research Program Agency  funding as well by $ 17.5 billion . So it is saying , yes , basic research is still very important . But it is also saying , for the first time , we need to get more out of the research that we do , and we need to have more translational science , that is , taking the basic research and applied research and actually using the applications of that in a more robust way so that we can translate more of that into actual science and manufacturing . Why is this so important ? Because we know that our competitiveness as a nation is suffering from the fact that people are looking at our own research and development . They are looking at our teachings and our publishing at universities and actually going and implementing this . So we need to do better on tech transfer . This underlying legislation not only helps us do that by helping to help universities who are our No . 1 research partner with Federal dollars , it allows those universities to help us with more tech transfer in innovative ways , that universities not just do the research , but help commercialize it . It also makes investments and helping them protect the patenting of that critical information , so no longer having that patentable information used in other places around the globe , but actually capitalizing on the jobs here in the United States . It also makes a huge investment in STEM , the science , technology , engineering , and math jobs that we need for the future . And clearly , you cannot make a major investment in research and development if you do not have the workforce to carry it out . And we need a workforce to carry it out . So this underlying legislation helps us not only diversify our workforce by a major investment in STEM , going from an annual budget of about $ 1 billion in the year 2020 to about $ 4 billion a year by 2026 . So we are going to get a more diversified STEM workforce with women and minorities participating . And we are also trying to distribute more of our engineering and science capacity around the United States . Our colleagues , Senators Schumer and Young , were adamant that we also look at innovation infrastructure happening in more regional places in the United States , where they may not currently have the R & D capability of some of our major institutions . So this legislation promises 20 percent of the research and investment dollars go to those EPSCoR states , Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research , an already identified landmark in how we distribute research dollars , that tries to grow the regional research infrastructure in more places in the United States . Again , I thank my colleagues Senator Wicker for leading the charge on that and helping us make that investment . And it also triples the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program , so that we get more out of manufacturing workforce training and resiliency of our supply chain for the future . As I mentioned before we left , it also includes an authorization for NASA and the Artemis mission and making sure that we are staying competitive . As Senator Nelson said in a House hearing on our mission and challenges , as China has made it clear , they are going to Mars , we are going back to the Moon to ready ourselves to go to Mars , and we think that it , too , deserves the funding and support to make us competitive . I think the bottom line here is that we know that American innovation drives the economy of the future . In a lot of ways , in passing this legislation today -- and just so our colleagues know , we will have a couple of votes here before we get to a final passage -- we really are doing our part . People hopefully will support this legislation enthusiastically , well past the majority of Members , because you believe in the history of the United States research and development that we have achieved innovation goals -- whether that was what we did with the internet , whether that was what we have done on biosciences , even on some of our issues as it relates to energy . We have achieved big breakthroughs . So today  vote is about investing in that innovation economy of the future . I am pretty confident because I have met some of these innovators across the United States . I do not know if everything that we have done so far will be absorbed by universities , our researchers , and our labs , but literally , we are trying to dust off R & D skills and make them more competitive for today . I guarantee you , though , these dollars that reach American entrepreneurs , who reach American innovators , they are ready and willing to take up this challenge . Give them those collaborative research resources through innovation at universities , through tech hubs , through more collaboration on workforce training , through investments in semiconductors , and I guarantee you these entrepreneurs in America will innovate our economy and create the economies of the future . And what is at stake ? If my colleagues have a better idea , I am willing to hear it . But I know this : Americans want us to lead on their regional economies , on the U.S. economies , and on global economies . They do not want to get left behind . They look at this time and era as a challenge to the leadership we have provided in the past . So settling for Federal investment being near their lowest point as a percentage of GDP in 60 years will not cut it . What cuts it is making an investment in R & D and empowering those entrepreneurs so they will create those future economies . I yield the floor . '\n",
    "\n",
    "rawmc4 = 'Mr. President , I come to the floor today to continue our discussion about the Endless Frontier Act and why America needs to make more investment in the areas of research and development for our Nation . This is critically important as we have gone through this debate with some of our colleagues , to talk about why this is important for the United States . I spent my time yesterday -- maybe somebody from the staff can come over and help me with the charts but , thank you -- the biggest reason we are doing this is because we believe in American know-how , that is we believe in American ingenuity and we believe in American know-how and we have discussed already how that has helped to build our country over and over and over again , that we are a nation of , if you will , explorers , of pioneers , and by necessity , inventors , and that has continued throughout the history of our country . So we are so proud to continue to make these investments in all areas of science , certainly in the areas of healthcare , but we are more specifically talking about the engineers of the physical science and engineering . And we are talking about why we should make an increase in both basic research with this underlying bill that continues to drive dollars into curiosity driven early stage research , so that we can continue to grow jobs and help our economy , and it also continues the effort by saying we should make more investments in STEM education , so the workforce that it will take for us to meet the job challenges of the future . So we are excited that we are there with American know-how , but we are also cognizant of this international debate that is going on , the debate about other countries and what they are investing in research and development . And one of the reasons why I like where we are in the United States is because our research and development ecosystem is really an ecosystem of many different agencies doing research and development . And not only are those research and development investments by these various agencies helping in particular areas -- because it is really distributed as this chart shows , the United States works with the private sector , it works with our public universities , and it works with various agencies . Instead of a centralized approach that you might find in other countries , the fact that we have this distributed ecosystem with , you know , the Department of Energy may collaborate with the Department of Agriculture , they may collaborate with the Department of Defense , NSF may collaborate with universities , universities may collaborate with the private sector -- it is an ecosystem , and that ecosystem is what is unique about research and development in the United States . It is not hierarchical , it is not the majority driven by the private sector , or by government , it is an ecosystem , and the fact that it is so distributed . That means , almost like the competition in various places , and the collaboration is helping us grow the innovation economy . So the one thing that we need to be cognizant of in this debate is that we want to preserve that . We want to preserve the uniqueness of our ecosystem . And that is why we are really talking today about this NSF , the National Science Foundation , principally , and you can see from this big pie we just had this debate , right , we had this debate , well , let  increase the defense R & D -- well , we are already doing a lot in defense R & D , of course , our colleagues are talking about the budget overall as it related to defense , but you can see that NSF , the numbers that they are at today at 6.8 are not really at the -- you know , you might think this whole debate we are spending , you know , billions of dollars to change the focus . This agency is a powerhouse , and it is a powerhouse mostly connected with universities , and the R & D that is done there has been in the basic research area . But now , this bill by our colleagues Senators Schumer and Young is about taking the basic research , continuing that , making a little bit of investment in that basic research , but then also now trying to accelerate all the research that we now have at our hands , our fingertips , at our minds , and saying , What other user-based research can we take , that basic and applied research , and actually put it into use in commercialization in the United States ? So if you will , capitalizing on a faster tech transfer and a faster deployment of these technologies -- why is this so important ? Well , it is important because , in the information age , a lot of people can read our published research and development , they can read what we are doing , and they can continue their research and development . Other nations are figuring out that research and development in an information age economy really does matter . They are figuring out that the United States has come a long way as a nation in building job growth , maintaining competitiveness , national security issues , all because we at the Federal Government level have said we believe in research and development with the public taxpayer dollars and it has benefited , whether it is the internet or the bio sciences and healthcare or on national security , the American public gets that that research has made us competitive as a nation . So we have had two previous attempts to make investments in this issue in America COMPETES , first started in the Bush administration in [ [ Page S3184 ] ] 2006 when President Bush published a report about America  competitiveness and proposed this concept of that small NSF budget that I was referring to , and articulated that we needed to double that budget within a 5-year or 7-year window of time .'\n",
    "\n",
    "rawmc5 = 'They felt that , with the level of change and transformation and innovation , that we would not be keeping pace on a global basis unless we made that investment . So in 2007 we passed the America COMPETES Act which gave money both to NSF and to DOE , and literally the first 3 years , we thought we were going to double this DOE budget and an investment in DOE within 7 years . So there was a little good news , a lot of euphoria in R & D , a lot of hope for STEM education , science , technology , engineering , and math . And then , in America COMPETES , the same request basically of a 60/40 split between NSF and energy , people thought we would end up -- well , we are not on pace , where we want to be , but , oh , we will get there within 11 years . Well , we will put enough money into this innovation effort that we will double our research and innovation budget as it relates to NSF and our energy innovation efforts in 11 years . Well , this is what really happened . We did not do either of those things . We are really on a track to have taken those 2007 numbers and double them in 22 years . So when you look back at the history and you say , Well , how did we -- what happened ? If we are so enthusiastic about this , if we identify this -- both a Republican President identified this and then a Democratic administration followed up , why did not we execute on this ? Why did not we execute on this doubling of this number and making this investment ? Well , we all know what happened , we basically hit a recession . And in a recession of 2009 and 2010 , we just did not live up to this obligation of funding the research and development that was in America COMPETES to the aggressiveness that we had all hoped for . I am not sure everybody even realizes that this effort fell short , that we did not make quite the level of investment that we wanted , that we were falling behind . I do not think anybody really understood it until now , when people see the incredible level of international competition . All of a sudden , as we see this incredible investment from the international community , people are starting to say , Well wait , what have we done on this effort ? So our next chart shows the fact that the United States has been a leader in global research and development , and as I said , I mentioned on the floor a report that was done by the Pew Charitable Trust -- I mean the Pew Research Center , that basically said 7 in 10 Americans believe in public investment in research and development . We have a higher regard for this than other nations , and we just do , I think , because people get it here , I think they get that we have invented a lot of things , they believe in that innovation , they know it creates jobs . And so we have a higher regard for that , and consequently , we have been the leader in world R & D for a very , very long time . But as this Information age has come along , other nations get that R & D leads to job creation , transformation , and certainly to security . So just since 1991 , we have seen China who was ninth in R & D -- now , they are No . 2 , and I am pretty sure , at current trajectories , will end up being No . 1 sometime very , very soon . And so it is , you know , not everything about China , although many of my colleagues here are going to discuss this is a China bill , I view it as a bill about the future and making the investments in the future to capture the economic opportunities . There are security issues here , clearly national security issues here . There are clearly issues about a supply chain and whether you can depend on a supply chain and whether , if you have a concentration of an industry in one region of the world , then are you really dependent on that one region of the world for that particular product ? What happened to all of us in the last year and a half -- and I am saying now on a global basis -- is the world community realized with COVID , well , wait , supply chains really matter , product really matters , where we get product in an emergency really matters , whether it does what it says it does in an emergency really matters . And so all of these issues about supply chains and who is building what and the intricacies of it really got ripped open in the COVID debate , and now , we are really , as the world community starts to look at this too , where do we get our product , who is making it , is it made to the standard that we want , is it secure ? And obviously , you know , people have made lots of decisions about supply chain based on just pure cost and effectiveness of a product , but now , people are starting to realize that it is way more complex , and it has led us to this current debate . So again , why do we do this , why does America want to make an investment in an innovation economy ? Well , we do not have to go too far to understand that from our past history . It enables competitiveness , and if you just think about , you know these sectors-I will never forget years ago we had somebody -- this was in the 80s , visit Seattle , and they said , Well , what is everybody going to do , make car phones and computers ?'\n",
    "\n",
    "rawmc6 = 'And in reality , there was a big decade or so of making what then was supposed to be great technology of a car phone , and obviously , we all know where we have now been with computers and operating systems and how much it drives the economy of the future , but at the time when we were seeing a transformation to that , people just thought , Well , what are we all going to do ? Is that what we are going to do ? Well , telecommunication , semiconductors , advanced materials , all were huge things that enabled this competitiveness of our Nation-in automobiles , in aviation , in the tech sector , in healthcare , in a whole variety of things . And it drives our economy with this level of innovation . The internet , just one example , is something we started working on in the 60s , became a reality in the 90s , and today , it is $ 2.3 trillion part of our national economy , and 12 percent of U.S. GDP . That is what we got out of previous research . That is what we got out of saying we are going to let scientists do basic research and figure out what they think are the most important advances moving forward . The job growth , millions of jobs , and national security today , we can see just from this past week in a pipeline that was affected by a cyber attack , we can not afford to take our foot off of national security research and development in the purposes of things like cyber security . We have to continue to be a leader in this area of technology . It is not as if you are not going to have intimidation of our Nation by somebody maybe sticking the nose of a foreign sub in U.S. waters or flying a spy plane over the United States , it is going to come in the form of intimidation of our banking system , or pipelines , or other senses of security and hacking . And so there is no doubt -- no doubt -- we need to stay on top of the level of investment in national security . I would say the underlying bill that we will be talking about next week in detail relates to a very important aspect of national security , and that is the area of semiconductors . We need to make an investment in our competitiveness in semiconductors , and we need to make that investment because it is going to be critical to our national security . So let me talk about a few things that are in the bill , just so people understand some of the priorities that Majority Leader Schumer and Senator Young came up with as it relates to this legislation . As I mentioned , it creates a new Tech Directorate in the office of NSF , the National Science Foundation , so that it will be like a DARPA system , that is , that they work with the private sector , they create technology centers , they build partnerships between government and academia , they support rapid technology demonstration , they advance the competitiveness of the United States in important fields like artificial intelligence quantum computing , biotechnology , and they focus on these ideas , similar to how DARPA has done , where the individuals involved are critical to the effort , that is to say , to get the best and brightest minds who are working in these areas to be part of this effort and concentration . We also looked at and improved in this legislation the fact that universities and academia provide a lot of research and development , but oftentimes , do not even -- in the academia world , people are focused on publishing . Publishing their research , that [ [ Page S3185 ] ] is kind of how they get known , that is what they get basically almost rewarded for at the university system , and you will be surprised how little time they take to actually take that research , turn it into a patent , and then turn it into a commercialized product . So one thing we heard in our hearings is that we needed to give more help to universities on tech transfer and patenting of information .'\n",
    "\n",
    "rawmc7 = 'Why patenting ? Because patenting helps us protect the science that we already have developed . It helps us -- say that somebody cannot just take that published science report and then go off in another country and develop it because it is now protected under our U.S. law . So we feel this is a very important effort , and we think that it also helps lead a lot of research at universities to then be supported , developed , exposed to the venture capital markets and thus actually helped turn into commercialization . So efforts at the University of Washington that specifically focused on this , specifically hired somebody to come into the university and kind of , if you will , shake the tree of the level of R & D that was being done and say , What are we doing to actually patent this content , what are we doing to actually transfer it into commercialization , had outstanding results ? Yes , it was a transformation of what our universities do , but in the end , they came up with something like , just in a few years , 20 companies that ended up becoming been , you know , supported by venture capitalists and making it on to the markets . So we are very excited that we will now , with this provision , be trying to get more out of the research we do , by patenting it and doing tech transfer . Our colleagues Senators Young and Schumer also believe that university research should continue to get investments , and that is the major aspect of the provision here is to have the Tech Directorate work on these 10 areas of expertise , work with selected universities around the United States on this critical focus of technology . I mentioned some of them : artificial intelligence , quantum computing , biotechnology , and many others . So the fact that the bill really is depending on our university system , I think , is something that our colleagues should applaud and be excited about . That chart that I showed at the beginning where everybody is working together , this is just research dollars going to the best universities in our Nation to continue to focus on this , but now focus on it in partnership with experts in these sectors and with industry so that we can actually get to a faster adoption rate and a faster implementation into commercial markets . So I think we are leaning in to our university system . That is a good idea . That is a good idea . What we are giving the university system , though , is the tools , the tools to help accelerate that development . And then , as I mentioned , we are also making a huge investment in STEM , more than $ 10 billion into STEM education . The chart I showed before talked about how we were going to do all these great things under America COMPETES in STEM . We did not quite get there . We did not really do that . I think this is like broadband . Everybody talks about it all the time , we think we have solved it five times , and you still think , Wait , I thought we solved broadband ? STEM is the same thing . You think we have funded STEM . We have not funded STEM . This represents a huge increase in our STEM education budget , but I will just tell you , this is so that we can get the researchers , the scientists , the fellows , if you will , at the higher education level for STEM . We still need to go and build the pipeline at our K-12 system so that we are putting more people into the pipeline . But hopefully , with the STEM dollars here , we will be , if you will , creating a new workforce for the innovation that we are trying to chase with the investments of these dollars . And we felt so strongly about this that we looked at the numbers and we were just astonished . There are so few women and minorities in STEM fields -- so few . The underlying bill our colleagues , Senator Schumer and Young , created a diversity office at , for the first time , over at NSF so they can focus on this issue . We put more resources to it within this STEM category so our colleagues and those at NSF could focus on it . And we expect to really try to take a very aggressive role here . That is what we heard from NSF in their research . STEM education cannot be a passive thing . It cannot be just , We are going to put some more dollars out for education . If we want to diversify in the sciences , we have to have a very , very aggressive approach . And so that aggressive approach means changing the faces of those who do the education , changing some of the faces of people who do investments , changing the dynamics of research . A lot of women were hurt in the last COVID pandemic who were researchers because they were juggling both taking care of their families or taking care of parents and doing their research . And so they had extra strains on them that made complexity to when they could get their research done . So we know we have to think about STEM education from the perspective of what are some of the challenges that face people going into those fields . But no doubt , this underlying legislation before us will have a big investment in that and continue NSF  leadership in trying to grow a more aggressive workforce . So the bill also includes , I should say , a few things about how one of our goals is to diversify innovation to many different parts of the United States . The challenge there is , you know , you are not going to sprinkle some dust on some magic words on some region of the United States , and all of a sudden , something is going to pop up-and nor do I personally expect it to . I always give the example of Walla Walla , which is a real place , Walla Walla , WA . I had a journalist ask once if that was a real place . Yes , it is a real place . It is a great wine-making place . But somebody might say , Walla Walla , WA , should be a research center . It has got a university , an outstanding university , Whitman . People might say it should be a tech hub or it should be a research center . Walla Walla found its rightful place when research was done , and a university professor at the University of Washington said , You know what , we can grow wine grapes . That really was not that long ago . That was in the 1980s . He said we can grow grapes . We were not growing grapes . Now , a couple of decades later , we have over a thousand wineries in the State of Washington . So not everybody is going to be a tech hub , but it does not mean that you are not going to use science to the best and highest use for a region of your State or the country . It is about empowering . As Director Panchanathan , the head of NSF says , it is about trying to have innovation everywhere , connected to opportunity everywhere , connected to universities . The point is let  build a better ecosystem that goes all throughout the United States so more and more people can take advantage of technology and innovation . So this is really , really important because we never know where the next person is going to come from , who is going to play a critical role in technology . And the more we build this infrastructure , the better . So this allows money for regional technology hubs to help concentrate in various parts of the country and expertise , more money for our manufacturing institutes which help manufacturers all across the United States focus on being competitive in their particular area , and it supports $ 2.4 billion for manufacturing extension programs , which are those things that really do work with , say , a particular sector like automobiles or aviation or some other type of manufacturing and help make them competitive . And as mentioned , it also , just like in the former COMPETES Act bills , puts some money into DOE . In this case , it puts about $ 17 billion into the Department of Energy so that its energy innovation can move forward . So let me talk for a second about this issue about national security and where we are with semiconductors because I expect this will get a bunch of focus next week as we talk about this legislation . The underlying bill has about $ 52 billion of investment for the semiconductor industry , so I am pretty sure people think , Well , wait , this is a lot of money , but it is a very big sector . It is essential to our defense , it is essential to navigation , it is essential to [ [ Page S3186 ] ] satellites , it is essential to healthcare , it is essential to consumer products . And the United States has been a leader in this area . The United States has been a leader in this area for a long time -- or I should say , was a leader in this area for a long time , when you think of companies like Intel or others , even some of the companies that are foreign investors who made huge footprints in the United States . But the point is that we are no longer in this position -- as this chart shows , only 12 percent of a global supply . A report recently done on the semiconductor industry by Boston Consulting Group , I just want to read this one part : `` The U.S. has been the long-standing global leader in semiconductors with 45 % to 50 % share of the worldwide market  -- 45-percent to 50-percent share of the worldwide market -- `` in the last 30 years . However , significant focus is being placed on ending the U.S. share in semiconductor manufacturing which now only stands at 12 % installed capacity .  This is a report that I am pretty sure you could get online . That is the end of that statement . So we have gone from 45 percent to 50 percent , that is where we started out , and over the last 30 years , now , we are down to 12 percent -- 12 percent . So I ask my colleagues , if you were 12 percent of anything , how long would you be around to be competitive ? How long would you drive the supply chain ? How long would you drive job growth ? How long would you continue to be competitive in this very , very important sector that is important to all of these things ? And while I am somebody who supports continued growth of our global economy because I think we build and make great things and we want people to sell them to , this presents to us a very unique challenge , the fact that something as critical to the information age as semiconductors , we have gone from 40 percent to 50 percent down to 12 percent the question is what is going to happen next . Well , the question of what is going to happen next is , if we do not make this investment , very , very likely that that 12 percent is going to , in the next several years , turn into 6 percent . It is going to turn into 6 percent . So staying status quo right now , doing no investment , it is very likely that 12 percent will turn into 6 percent , which means people are not going to want to locate their boundaries in the United States . People are not going to want to locate their research in the United States -- people are not going to want to have their companies and the supply chain and the workforce . Literally , this industry simply is clusters , it is clusters . Seattle did not get to be Seattle overnight . Seattle did not get to be the hub of the No . 1 STEM city in the United States of America and certainly an epicenter of software and software development overnight . It took decades -- decades . Literally , you know , even in the 1980s and 1990s , it was not that diversified . It has just been in the last 15 years that it has really diversified . But , yes , it took the work of the University of Washington . Yes , it took the work of many companies being there . Then it took the work of then people attracting a workforce who would rather be there than , say , in Silicon Valley . And then it took the efforts of universities to produce a workforce . Then it took attracting venture capital . Then once they got venture capital , then more companies wanted to come there because then you have the entire ecosystem . You had universities , you had venture capital , you had leading companies , you had a workforce , and you had all of this stuff . Well , that is in software , and software can continue to move forward , but if you did not have those things , you are not going to be a cluster for semiconductors . The United States of America -- the cluster of semiconductor development is going to be in Asia . It is going to be in Korea . It is going to be in Taiwan , and it is going to be in China . So we have to ask ourselves if we are only 6 percent of the supply in the future and we cannot really control the development and we lose our edge in this and then basically we have to rely on a supply chain for all the chips , you know , in the world , where is the supply chain that we are going to rely on for the national security products and defense technology and satellites and maybe some of these other consumer products that then end up getting used for other purposes ? That is what this debate is about . It is about that we went from 45 percent to 50 percent down to 12 percent . If we do nothing , we are going to 6 percent , and the epicenter of a critical technology is going to move to Asia . So I personally want to see us be successful in keeping a sector in the United States . I am very proud that that same Boston report shows that we have 49 percent of the aerospace manufacturing market in the United States . I am very proud of that because we are an epicenter of that . Forty-nine percent of the manufacturing market for aerospace is in the United States . That represents , to my region , maybe 150,000 to 200,000 jobs in the Northwest . To the United States , that is 2 million jobs -- more than 2 million probably if you think about some of the other related sectors . So being 49 percent of the supply chain in the United States for aerospace really , really , really matters . And I do not want to see that slip . You know , we have had a discussion about the fact that we have the Jones Act . Now , some of our colleagues might not support the Jones Act , but the Jones Act is we decide , Well , we are not going to be all the shipbuilding in the world . Shipbuilding is going to get built in other places . But , oh , my gosh , we have to have enough shipbuilding in the United States so if we are at war , products and services that we need to support our military can be transported on U.S. vessels . That is why we have the Jones Act because we decided that that sector was critical enough to support . And what we are saying here is that this sector is critical enough to support , too . I do not know that we are ever going to be 49 percent like aerospace manufacturing is -- probably not , probably because it would take a lot more money than we are talking about here -- because the rest of this world is chasing this market , too . They are chasing it fast and furious . We have to ask ourselves , Do we want to end up at 6 percent , or are we want going to try to reverse this trend and make an investment and make it as smart as possible ? I thought we had one more chart , but I guess we do not . So I guess we are back to this . Is this bill  investment worth taking the chance on American know-how ? Is it worth the history of our country and saying , We have done a lot in research and development , and we know how to get things done . When I think of some of the people in this story , I think one of the guys on the GI Bill was one of the first contributors to semiconductors . It is a guy who basically went to school on a GI Bill , and if you think about the capital formation and capital markets we have in the United States , it has contributed to allowing that technology to move more rapidly . Our investment in higher education has allowed this to move more rapidly . So to my colleagues who are not sure about this legislation or think that it sounds like a lot or thinks that it sounds like , Oh , I do not understand it , it is really quite simple . Do you want to make a bigger investment in our contribution to American know-how with research and development and let them compete to winning the next generation of jobs ? I do . I do . I want to do that because I want to see what comes next . I think it is one of the most exciting things about today and where we live today . We are not in the agrarian age ; we are not in the industrial age . We are in the information age where everything can be created in the blink of an eye and now distributed and transform our economy in such significant ways . I want to see what comes next . But we cannot do it by passing legislation , authorizing things and then not appropriating the money and then waking up in 10 years and finding that we are at the lowest percentage of research and development to GDP in 60 years . That is where we are , the lowest percentage . So we cannot do that . We have to make these investments and if we invest in American know-how , the rest of this will take care of itself . I yield the floor .'\n",

    "rawdd = 'Dick DURBIN . Mr. President , last week , China announced that it would now allow families to have three children -- a profound shift from their previous one- and two-child policies . Why the change ? China looked to the future and realized that its population policies would hamper economic growth . Now , the U.S. Government will never tell families how many children to have . That choice is profoundly personal . Yet we must ask ourselves the same questions China is asking : What kind of changes will lead or deter the United States from a future of economic growth and prosperity ? How can we enhance America  competitiveness ? And more than just compete , how can we make sure America comes in first ? [ [ Page S3978 ] ] The answer is obvious : Invest in American creativity . China is investing heavily in electric vehicles , critical minerals , energy production , computer chips -- the list goes on . In all of these areas , China is beginning to pull ahead of the pack . They are aiming for first . And what underscores all of their efforts ? Research . Every breakthrough , every new technology , every scientific step forward opens new markets and drives their economy into the future at high speed . Unfortunately , it is a different story in America . For decades , in both the public and private sectors , we have downsized our discovery and innovation investments . Since the days of the space race , we have stepped away from the great challenge of discovery . If we were to commit the same percentage of our national budget to research today as we did in the Apollo era , we would invest $ 900 billion over 5 years . That kind of an investment puts people on the Moon . That kind of investment puts us in first . So how do we get there ? The U.S . Innovation and Competition Act would set us back on track and at a fraction of the cost of Apollo-era spending . As we debate and hopefully pass this bill , we must keep asking : What are we willing to do to be No . 1 ? One important way we can compete with countries like China is by increasing support for domestic manufacturing and strengthening our domestic supply chains . The legislation before us does exactly that . It provides $ 52 billion in emergency funding to boost our domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities . In 1990 , the United States produced 37 percent of the world  semiconductors , but today , just 12 percent of semiconductors are manufactured in the United States . Now , we are facing a global shortage of microchips , which is impacting jobs in my State and many others . I am proud that Illinois has long been a leader in auto manufacturing , thanks to dedicated workers like those at a Stellantis plant in Belvidere , IL , who assemble Jeep Cherokees . Unfortunately , that plant was forced to shut down in March due to the global shortage of semiconductors . And last month , Stellantis announced that as many as 1,640 employees at the plant could be laid off in July -- again , because it does not have enough microchips . After briefly resuming operations last week , the plant already has had to shut down again for 2 weeks because of this shortage . Last week , I spoke to representatives from Stellantis who shared that the U.S . Innovation and Competition Act could make a real difference in terms of boosting supply of these chips . This funding is not just important for the assembly plant in Belvidere . Sadly , we are seeing similar impacts of the semiconductor shortage at Ford  Chicago Assembly Plant , which supports 5,800 jobs . That plant was idled through April , with shutdowns extended into May . We urgently need to act to address this global microchip shortage to provide certainty to the workers whose livelihoods depend on a stable supply of semiconductors . The legislation before us will not only address our immediate market needs but it will also help prevent these shortages again the future . This investment supports jobs across the entire supply chain , from construction of new facilities , to manufacturing and development of chips , to workers in the auto industry who depend on a reliable supply of semiconductors , to American consumers . The U.S . Innovation and Competition Act is the result of weeks of negotiation and bipartisan work . I was puzzled by some of my Republican colleagues  arguments for voting against cloture on this bill . If you do not want China  products and values to dominate the global marketplace , why would you cede that marketplace to China -- or anyone else , for that matter ? If you believe in America  products , values , and most of all , its people , then do the smart thing : Invest in them . Although some of my colleagues seem to believe otherwise , invective is not going to win this global competition . We need investment to remain No . 1 . No one bill will secure America  economic prosperity or national security or resolve all of the outstanding issues in our relationship with China , but strengthening America  role as a global leader in science and technology is an essential piece of our effort to preserving American leadership in this world . So I put it to my fellow Senators : Let us take a step forward today . Let us invest in the research , the jobs , and the future that all Americans deserve . I plan to vote in favor of the U.S . Innovation and Competition Act , and I urge my colleagues to do the same . Let us not settle for second best . Let us put America in the lead . '\n",

    "rawdd2 = 'Mr. President , years ago , I traveled to Israel with then-minority leader Senator Harry Reid . We met with Shimon Peres , and something happened that I have never forgotten . [ [ Page S2750 ] ] Senator Reid asked : `` What do you see as the greatest threat in the world to the United States ? '' That was just a couple of years after 9/ 11 when that question was posed . I thought Peres might cite terrorism or loose nukes . Instead , he said without hesitation : `` China . Do you not see that ? '' Economically , strategically , diplomatically , China was already focused like a laser on advancing its position as the world  most powerful nation , and that was 16 years ago . Five days ago , China launched a spacecraft safely and landed it on Mars , becoming only the second nation in history , after the United States , to land on the Red Planet . In 1957 , at the height of the Cold War , the Soviet Union became the first nation to launch an Earth-orbiting satellite into space . That launch shocked the world and caught us off guard . Our response was an unprecedented commitment to reclaim America  dominance in the world as a leader in scientific and technological discovery and innovation . The effort became known as America  Sputnik moment . Twelve years later , America put a man on the Moon . You might say that now , instead of a Sputnik moment , America is going through a Zhurong moment . That is the name of the Chinese Mars rover , Zhurong . Let me be clear . While China is our fastest growing competitor , the United States has lost some ground globally as many nations recognize the importance of R & D investments to their industrial innovation and competitiveness . In 1960 , just 3 years after Sputnik launched , the United States accounted for approximately 69 percent of the world  R & D funding . By 2018 , 58 years later , this percentage had dropped from 69 percent to 28 percent . Others were joining in the pursuit of technology and innovation at a record clip . The question is , Can we come together , as Americans did in the last century , to make investments in science , technology , and competitiveness to guarantee that America  economy remains the world  largest and most innovative ? Some Members of Congress and the Senate -- and we have heard their speeches on the floor -- say : Go slow . No hurry . Well , I think they are committed to a solid second-place finish for the United States of America , and I do not want to be a part of it . The Endless Frontier Act , which we are going to consider , gives us a reason for hope . It is broad-based . It is bipartisan . It shows leadership by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer ; Senator Todd Young , Republican of Indiana ; along with Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell of Washington and Ranking Member Roger Wicker of Mississippi . Like America  response to Sputnik , the new era of scientific and technological discovery will be driven by seed money from the Federal Government , but this effort is not limited to government spending . America is home to the world  best research colleges and universities and laboratories , like the Argonne National Lab in my State of Illinois . They are part of this effort too . We will harness the combined efforts of America  best scientific and technological minds in the public sector and the private sector . The Endless Frontier Act and broader competitiveness package represent the largest investment in U.S. science and technology since the Apollo era . It will authorize more than $ 100 billion over 5 years to support breakthrough scientific discovery and technological innovation in 10 key areas vital to building an innovation economy for the 21st century and creating good jobs in the process . These key areas include fields such as advanced energy , semiconductors , artificial intelligence , biotechnology and genomics , quantum computing , robotics , materials science , disaster prevention , and , of course , cyber security . If you need a reminder of why it is urgent that we improve U.S. cyber security , look at how the ransomware attack last week by Russian cyber criminals on a major American oil pipeline caused long gas lines and panic buying throughout the eastern half of our country . Investing strategically in these 10 key innovation areas will enable the United States to protect America  position as a leader in the global economy and protect our national security . It will reinvigorate and expand our industrial and manufacturing base , and it will create a stronger middle class in our country . The Endless Frontier Act will also strengthen the security of essential supply chains and our ability to solve disruptions caused by crises . Remember those fearless doctors and nurses working in COVID-19 wards last year , when they had to dress in garbage bags because of a nationwide shortage of PPE ? A nation as wealthy and powerful as ours should never be caught so dangerously unprepared . This bill will make sure that we are not . Here is another cautionary tale about supply-line disruption . In Belvidere , IL , which is in the northern part of our State , workers at the Stellantis plant are proud of their work assembling Jeep Cherokees . In late March , that plant was forced to shut down because of a global shortage of microchips . The plant is scheduled to reopen as soon as the end of this month . But late last week , the company announced that the plant will be forced to shut down one of its two production lines in late July , again because of microchip shortages . As many as 1,600 employees could be laid off . You cannot build a prosperous economy and stable middle class if you cannot secure your supply lines . We know that American workers can build cars and trucks for the future because they are already doing it , and they are going to be launching it in many places around our Nation . Just this week , President Biden visited an electric vehicle assembly plant in Michigan . And they are doing it today as well in Normal , IL , where a company called Rivian -- remember the name : R-I-V-I-A-N , Rivian -- repurposed and expanded a former Mitsubishi assembly plant to produce the company  first assembly plant for electric cars and trucks . Is this going to work ? Will it actually have a demand for electric vehicles ? Remember this one too . Amazon has already ordered 100,000 delivery vans from this plant . By the end of the year , Rivian expects to employ 2,500 people at the Normal assembly plant , 2,500 workers in good- paying , middle-class jobs in America . The Endless Frontier Act and President Biden  American Jobs Plan provides the leadership and resources to make sure that America remains the world leader in the 21st century . On another critical issue , let me say that we need to get serious when it comes to combating intellectual property theft and counterfeiting . The previous administration  policies were haphazard . We can do better . The Endless Frontier Act will impose tough sanctions on entities that violate U.S. intellectual property and trade protections . I am working with Senator Cassidy , a Republican from Louisiana , and others on a bipartisan bill that provides additional safeguards to combat the sale of counterfeit goods , especially on the internet . As I said , the Endless Frontier Act and competitiveness package will invest more than $ 100 billion over 5 years to support breakthrough technologies . Now , $ 100 billion is a big investment , but it is dramatically less than what China is now spending in the same areas . And it is far less when adjusted for inflation than what we spent on the race for space . If we contributed the same share of our GDP to science and technology today as we did in the early 1960s -- 1 percent of our overall economy -- we would have to spend $ 900 billion , not $ 100 billion , in this effort . My support for the Endless Frontier Act builds on my commitment to securing steady , predictable funding increases for so many research Agencies of the Federal Government but especially for NIH . They provided the lifesaving vaccines that allow us to take off our masks and resume our lives . Monday , I went out to NIH with several of my colleagues . Senator Blunt led a group from the Appropriations Committee . We met with NIH Director Francis Collins , Dr. Anthony Fauci , and scientists who are working on breakthrough discoveries . It was 6 years ago that Senator Roy Blunt , Republican from Missouri , and I made an informal pact . We worked together to increase the NIH budget by 5 percent a year over and above inflation . With the help of Senator Patty [ [ Page S2751 ] ] Murray and Lamar Alexander , we increased the NIH budget more than 40 percent . Because of those modest investments and the genius of NIH-funded researchers , we have a real chance of developing better treatments and cures for terrible diseases , including cancers , sickle cell , and Alzheimer  . The race for the future is not an either-or deal -- either we invest in science or breakthrough technologies . We have to invest in both . I will continue to work with Senators from both parties to preserve steady , predictable funding increases for research . No one bill will safeguard our national security or resolve all of our outstanding issues with China . We still have a lot of work to do , both in Congress and diplomatically . We still have to strengthen our immigration system so that America continues to welcome immigrants who want to put their genius to work for the good of America , as Nikola Tesla and Albert Einstein did in the last century , as did Katalin Kariko , the Hungarian-born Nobel laureate whose NIH-funded research paved the way for today  COVID vaccines . Strengthening America  role as a global leader in science and technology is an essential piece of our effort to preserving our leadership in the world . For that reason , I support the Endless Frontier Act , and I urge my colleagues to do the same .'"
