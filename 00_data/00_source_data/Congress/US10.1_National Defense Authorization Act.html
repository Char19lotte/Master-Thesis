     under this chapter (referred to in this section as the 
     `applicant&#x27;), the Judge Advocate General shall order DNA 
     testing of specific evidence if the Judge Advocate General 
     finds that all of the following apply:
       ``(1) The applicant asserts, under penalty of perjury, that 
     the applicant is actually innocent of the offense for which 
     the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment or death.
       ``(2) The specific evidence to be tested was secured in 
     relation to the investigation or prosecution of the offense 
     referenced in the applicant&#x27;s assertion under paragraph (1).
       ``(3) The specific evidence to be tested--
       ``(A) was not previously subjected to DNA testing and the 
     applicant did not knowingly fail to request DNA testing of 
     that evidence in a prior motion for postconviction DNA 
     testing; or
       ``(B) was previously subjected to DNA testing and the 
     applicant is requesting DNA testing using a new method or 
     technology that is substantially more probative than the 
     prior DNA testing.
       ``(4) The specific evidence to be tested is in the 
     possession of the Government and has been subject to a chain 
     of custody and retained under conditions sufficient to ensure 
     that such evidence has not been substituted, contaminated, 
     tampered with, replaced, or altered in any respect material 
     to the proposed DNA testing.
       ``(5) The proposed DNA testing is reasonable in scope, uses 
     scientifically sound methods, and is consistent with accepted 
     forensic practices.
       ``(6) The applicant identifies a theory of defense that--
       ``(A) is not inconsistent with an affirmative defense 
     presented at trial; and
       ``(B) would establish the actual innocence of the applicant 
     of the offense referenced in the applicant&#x27;s assertion under 
     paragraph (1).
       ``(7) If the applicant was convicted following a trial, the 
     identity of the perpetrator was at issue in the trial.

     produce new material evidence that would--
       ``(A) support the theory of defense referenced in paragraph 
     (6); and
       ``(B) raise a reasonable probability that the applicant did 
     not commit the offense.

     provide a DNA sample for purposes of comparison.

     or within three years after the date of the entry of judgment 
     under section 860c of this title (article 60c), whichever 
     comes later. Such presumption may be rebutted upon a 
     showing--
       ``(i) that the applicant&#x27;s petition for a DNA test is based 
     solely upon information used in a previously denied motion; 
     or
       ``(ii) of clear and convincing evidence that the 
     applicant&#x27;s filing is done solely to cause delay or harass.
       ``(B) There shall be a rebuttable presumption against 
     timeliness for any petition not satisfying subparagraph (A) 
     above. Such presumption may be rebutted upon the Judge 
     Advocate General&#x27;s finding--
       ``(i) that the applicant was or is incompetent and such 
     incompetence substantially contributed to the delay in the 
     applicant&#x27;s motion for a DNA test;
       ``(ii) the evidence to be tested is newly discovered DNA 
     evidence;
       ``(iii) that the applicant&#x27;s petition is not based solely 
     upon the applicant&#x27;s own assertion of innocence and, after 
     considering all relevant facts

     result in a manifest injustice; or
       ``(iv) upon good cause shown.

     unmistakable, clear, plain, or indisputable and requires that 
     the opposite conclusion be clearly evident.
       ``(b) Appeal of Denial.-- The applicant may appeal the 
     Judge Advocate General&#x27;s denial of the petition of DNA 
     testing to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.

     the preparation of an inventory of the evidence related to

     under this section shall be paid by the Government.

     completed not later than 60 days after the date on which the 
     test is ordered by the Judge Advocate General; and

     DNA testing ordered under this section is completed, the 
     Judge Advocate General shall order any post-testing 
     procedures under subsection (f) or (g), as appropriate.
       ``(f) Disclosure of Test Results.--Reporting of test 
     results shall be simultaneously disclosed to the Government

     General may order further testing, if appropriate, or may 
     deny the applicant relief.

     under this section show that the applicant was the source of 
     the DNA evidence, the Judge Advocate General shall--

     applicant as the source of the DNA evidence, the applicant 
     may file a petition for a new trial or resentencing, as 
     appropriate.
       ``(2) Standard for granting motion for new trial or 
     resentencing.--The applicant&#x27;s petition for a new trial or 
     resentencing, as appropriate, shall be granted if the DNA 
     test results, when considered with all other evidence in the 
     case (regardless of whether such evidence was introduced at

     such personnel action shall result in an immediate hardship 
     to the member alleging the personnel action, the Inspector 
     General shall promptly notify the Secretary of the military 
     department concerned or the Secretary of Homeland Security, 
     as applicable, of the hardship, and such Secretary shall take 
     such action as such Secretary determines appropriate.&#x27;&#x27;.

     which there is a sentencing parameter under subsection (d), 
     the military judge shall sentence the accused for that 
     offense within the applicable parameter.
       ``(B) Exception.--The military judge may impose a sentence

     under paragraph (1) shall identify offense-specific factors 
     the military judge should consider and any collateral effects 
     of available punishments that may aid the military judge in 
     determining an appropriate sentence when there is no 
     applicable sentencing parameter for a specific offense.

       ``(A) In general.--There is established within the 
     Department of Defense a board, to be known as the `Military

     SEC. 747. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NATIONAL WARRIOR CALL DAY.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) Establishing an annual ``National Warrior Call Day&#x27;&#x27; 
     will draw attention to those members of the Armed Forces 
     whose connection to one another is key to our veterans and 
     first responders who may be dangerously disconnected from 
     family, friends, and support systems.
       (2) The number of suicides of members of the Armed Forces 
     serving on active duty increased to 377 in 2020, a figure up 
     from 348 the previous year.
       (3) The epidemic of veteran suicide has steadily increased 
     since 2014 with 6,435 veterans taking their own lives in 
     2018.
       (4) After adjusting for sex and age, the rate of veteran 
     suicide in 2018 was 27.5 per 100,000 individuals, higher than 
     the rate among all United States adults at 18.3.

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4663">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4663">H4663</a></a>]]

       (5) More veterans have died by suicide in the last 10 years 
     than members of the Armed Forces who died from combat in 
     Vietnam.
       (6) Roughly two-thirds of these veterans who take their own 
     lives have had no contact with the Department of Veterans 
     Affairs.
       (7) The COVID-19 pandemic has only increased isolation and 
     disconnection, further exacerbating mental and physical 
     ailments such as post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic 
     brain injury.
       (8) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention note 
     that law enforcement officers and firefighters are more 
     likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty, and 
     emergency medical services providers are 1.39 times more 
     likely to die by suicide than members of the general public.
       (9) Invisible wounds linked to an underlying and 
     undiagnosed traumatic brain injury can mirror many mental 
     health conditions, a problem that can be addressed through 
     connections to members of the Armed Forces and veterans who 
     can better identify and address these wounds.
       (10) Urgent research is needed to highlight the connection 
     between traumatic brain injury as a root cause of invisible 
     wounds and suicide by members of the Armed Forces and 
     veterans.
       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
     Congress--
       (1) supports the designation of a ``National Warrior Call 
     Day&#x27;&#x27;;
       (2) encourages all Americans, especially members of the 
     Armed Forces serving on active duty and veterans, to call up 
     a warrior, have an honest conversation, and connect them with 
     support, understanding that making a warrior call could save 
     a life; and
       (3) implores all Americans to recommit themselves to 
     engaging with members of the Armed Forces through ``National 
     Warrior Call Day&#x27;&#x27; and constructive efforts that result in 
     solutions and treatment for the invisible scars they carry.

     Operations, General John W. Raymond, has often stated; and
       (3) in areas in which legislative action is needed, 
     including with respect to organizational structure and 
     personnel requirements, the Secretary of the Air Force and 
     the Chief of Space Operations should maintain consistent

     build a small organization responsive to a rapidly changing 
     domain--is upheld.

     SEC. 1247. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON TAIWAN DEFENSE RELATIONS.

       It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96-8; 22 U.S.C. 
     3301 et seq.) and the Six Assurances provided by the United 
     States to Taiwan in July 1982 are the foundation for United 
     States-Taiwan relations;
       (2) as set forth in the Taiwan Relations Act, the United 
     States decision to establish diplomatic relations with the 
     People&#x27;s Republic of China rests upon the expectation that 
     the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means, 
     and that any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by 
     other than peaceful means, including boycotts and embargoes, 
     is of grave concern to the United States;
       (3) the increasingly coercive and aggressive behavior of 
     the People&#x27;s Republic of China toward Taiwan is contrary to 
     the expectation of the peaceful resolution of the future of 
     Taiwan;
       (4) as set forth in the Taiwan Relations Act, the capacity 
     to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that 
     would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic 
     system, of the people on Taiwan should be maintained;
       (5) the United States should continue to support the 
     development of capable, ready, and modern defense forces 
     necessary for Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense 
     capability, including by--
       (A) supporting acquisition by Taiwan of defense articles 
     and services through foreign military sales, direct 
     commercial sales, and industrial cooperation, with an 
     emphasis on capabilities that support the asymmetric defense 
     strategy of Taiwan, including anti-ship, coastal defense, 
     anti-armor, air defense, undersea warfare, advanced command, 
     control, communications, computers, intelligence, 
     surveillance, and reconnaissance, and resilient command and 
     control capabilities;
       (B) ensuring timely review of and response to requests of 
     Taiwan for defense articles and services;
       (C) conducting practical training and military exercises 
     with Taiwan that enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self- 
     defense capability, as described in the Taiwan Relations Act;
       (D) exchanges between defense officials and officers of the 
     United States and Taiwan at the strategic, policy, and 
     functional levels, consistent with the Taiwan Travel Act 
     (Public Law 115-135; 132 Stat. 341), especially for the 
     purposes of--
       (i) enhancing cooperation on defense planning;
       (ii) improving the interoperability of the military forces 
     of the United States and Taiwan; and
       (iii) improving the reserve force of Taiwan;
       (E) identifying improvements in Taiwan&#x27;s ability to use 
     asymmetric military capabilities to enhance its defensive 
     capabilities, as described in the Taiwan Relations Act; and
       (F) expanding cooperation in humanitarian assistance and 
     disaster relief; and
       (6) the United States should be committed to the defense of 
     a free and open society in the face of aggressive efforts by 
     the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China to curtail 
     or influence the free exercise of rights and democratic 
     franchise.

     SEC. 1249. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ENHANCING DEFENSE AND 
                   SECURITY COOPERATION WITH SINGAPORE.

       It is the sense of Congress as follows:
       (1) The United States and Singapore have built a strong, 
     enduring, and forward-looking strategic partnership based on 
     long-standing and mutually beneficial cooperation, including 
     through security, defense, economic, and people-to-people 
     ties.
       (2) Robust security cooperation between the United States 
     and Singapore is crucial to promoting peace and stability in 
     the Indo-Pacific region.
       (3) The status of Singapore as a ``Major Security 
     Cooperation Partner&#x27;&#x27; of the United States, as recognized in 
     the Strategic Framework Agreement between the United States 
     and the Republic of Singapore for a Closer Partnership in 
     Defense and Security, done at Washington, D.C. on July 12, 
     2005, plays an important role in the global network of 
     strategic partnerships, especially in promoting maritime 
     security and countering terrorism.
       (4) The United States values Singapore&#x27;s provision of 
     access to its military facilities, which supports the 
     continued security presence of the United States in Southeast 
     Asia and across the Indo-Pacific region.
       (5) The United States should continue to welcome the 
     presence of the military forces of Singapore in the United 
     States for exercises and training, and should consider 
     opportunities to expand such activities at additional 
     locations in the United States as appropriate, including 
     through cooperation mechanisms such as the memorandum of 
     understanding agreed to by the

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4694">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4694">H4694</a></a>]]

     United States and Singapore in December 2019 to establish a 
     fighter jet training detachment in Guam.
       (6) The United States should continue to strengthen all 
     aspects of the bilateral defense relationship with Singapore, 
     which benefitted from the signing of the 2015 enhanced 
     Defense Cooperation Agreement to expand cooperation in the 
     military, policy, strategic and technology spheres, as well 
     as cooperation in non-conventional security areas such as 
     piracy and transnational terrorism, humanitarian assistance 
     and disaster relief, cyber-security, and biosecurity.
       (7) As the United States and Singapore have renewed the 
     1990 Memorandum of Understanding Regarding the United States 
     Use of Facilities in Singapore and mark the 55th anniversary 
     of bilateral relations in 2021, the United States should--
       (A) continue to enhance defense and security cooperation 
     with Singapore to promote peace and stability in the Indo-
     Pacific region based on common interests and shared values;
       (B) reinforce the status of Singapore as a major security 
     cooperation partner of the United States; and
       (C) explore additional steps to better facilitate 
     interoperability between the United States Armed Forces and 
     the military forces of Singapore to promote peace and 
     stability in the Indo-Pacific region.

     SEC. 1250. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

       It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) South Korea continues to be a critical ally of the 
     United States;
       (2) the presence of United States Armed Forces in South 
     Korea serves as a strong deterrent against North Korean 
     military aggression and as a critical support platform for 
     national security engagements in the Indo-Pacific region;
       (3) the presence of approximately 28,500 members of the 
     United States Armed Forces deployed to South Korea serves not 
     only as a stabilizing force to the Korean peninsula but also 
     as a reassurance to all our allies in the region; and
       (4) the United States should continue to--
       (A) maintain and strengthen its bilateral relationship with 
     South Korea and with other regional allies such as Japan; and
       (B) maintain its existing robust military presence in South 
     Korea to deter aggression against the United States and its 
     allies and partners.

     SEC. 1251. SENSE OF CONGRESS WITH RESPECT TO QATAR.

        It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) the United States and the country of Qatar have built a 
     strong, enduring, and forward-looking strategic partnership 
     based on long-standing and mutually beneficial cooperation, 
     including through security, defense, and economic ties;
       (2) robust security cooperation between the United States 
     and Qatar is crucial to promoting peace and stability in the 
     Middle East region;
       (3) Qatar plays a unique role as host of the forward 
     headquarters for the United States Central Command, and that 
     partnership facilitates United States coalition operations 
     countering terrorism;
       (4) Qatar is a major security cooperation partner of the 
     United States, as recognized in the 2018 Strategic Dialogue 
     and the 2019 Memorandum of Understanding to expand Al Udeid 
     Air Base to improve and expand accommodation for United 
     States military personnel;
       (5) the United States values Qatar&#x27;s provision of access to 
     its military facilities and its management and financial 
     assistance in expanding the Al Udeid Air Base, which supports 
     the continued security presence of the United States in the 
     Middle East region; and
       (6) the United States should continue to strengthen the 
     relationship between the United States and Qatar, including 
     through security and economic cooperation.

     SEC. 1302. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED STATES DEFENSE POSTURE 
                   IN EUROPE.

       It is the sense of Congress as follows:
       (1) The United States is steadfastly committed to upholding 
     and strengthening its defense alliances and partnerships in 
     the European theater. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
     (NATO) alliance is the bedrock of these relationships, which 
     are central to deterring Russian aggression, upholding 
     territorial integrity and sovereignty in Europe, countering 
     malign efforts to undermine the rules-based international 
     order and disrupt shared values, fostering international 
     cooperation against collective challenges, and advancing 
     shared national security objectives worldwide.

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4695">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4695">H4695</a></a>]]

       (2) United States allies in Europe have made substantial 
     strides on responsibility-sharing and defense investment 
     since the Wales Declaration in 2014 and should be commended 
     for their ongoing efforts to increase complementary 
     investments in NATO deterrence capacity. These efforts have 
     provided an accumulated increase of more than 
     $130,000,000,000 in foreign investments between 2016 and 2020 
     to strengthen trans-Atlantic security, and it is essential 
     that the United States continue to press NATO allies to 
     achieve their Wales Summit pledges and continue to make 
     progress on greater complementary defense investments.
       (3) The behavior of the Russian Government has not improved 
     and has, in many aspects, become increasingly belligerent 
     since the invasion of Ukraine in 2014, with respect to--
       (A) military efforts to disrupt the territorial integrity 
     of sovereign countries in Europe;
       (B) threats against the United States, NATO, and other 
     United States partners;
       (C) intervention in allied democratic processes;
       (D) efforts to disrupt United States alliances, 
     partnerships, and values;
       (E) acts such as assassination and the use of chemical 
     weapons on the territory of other sovereign countries; and
       (F) other high-risk, disruptive efforts.
       (4) Continued commitment to enhancing the United States and 
     allied force posture in Europe is indispensable for efforts 
     to establish and sustain a credible deterrent against Russian 
     aggression and long-term strategic competition by the Russian 
     government. The Secretary of Defense must continue to--
       (A) support the European Deterrence Initiative and other 
     investments in a strengthened United States and allied force 
     posture in Europe;
       (B) support rotational deployments and robust exercises in 
     the European theater;
       (C) complete efforts to establish prepositioned stocks and 
     effective staging infrastructure to maintain credible 
     deterrence against Russian threats;
       (D) invest effectively in multi-service, cyber, 
     information, and air defense efforts to counter modern 
     military challenges, enhance the survivability and 
     flexibility of the United States force posture, logistics, 
     and planning; and
       (E) consider whether additional forward-positioned forces 
     in Europe would reduce cost and strain, enhance credibility, 
     and strengthen capabilities.

     SEC. 1303. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO THE 
                   BALTIC COUNTRIES.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) The United States has cumulatively allocated over 
     $498,965,000 in Department of Defense partner capacity 
     funding for the Baltic countries since fiscal year 2018, 
     including over $219,000,000 for the Baltic security efforts 
     known as the ``Baltic Security Initiative&#x27;&#x27;, executed using 
     sections 332 and 333 of title 10, United States Code, 
     including assistance with respect to air defense, maritime 
     situational awareness, ammunition, C4ISR, anti-tank 
     capability, special forces, and other defense capabilities.
       (2) The Secretary of Defense has completed the 
     comprehensive Baltic Defense Assessment required by section 
     1246 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
     Year 2020 and has recommended continued robust, comprehensive 
     investment Baltic security efforts in accordance with that 
     assessment, with assistance executed using such sections 332 
     and 333.
       (3) The Secretary of Defense has assessed that the 
     authority granted by such sections 332 and 333 affords the 
     most efficient and effective authority to provide this 
     assistance to the Baltic countries, and that attempting to 
     provide the assistance pursuant to alternate authorities 
     would hamper the Department&#x27;s ability to deliver assistance 
     and implement the investment program established by the 
     Baltic Defense Assessment.
       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress strongly supports the 
     robust assistance to accomplish United States strategic 
     objectives in accordance with sections 332 and 333 of title 
     10, United States Code, including by providing assistance to 
     the Baltic countries using those sections, funded by the 
     Baltic Security Initiative. It is the sense of Congress that 
     the security of the Baltic region is crucial to the security 
     of the NATO alliance and these efforts are critical to ensure 
     continued deterrence against Russian aggression and bolster 
     allied security.

            Subtitle B--Security Cooperation and Assistance

     SEC. 1311. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY FOR CERTAIN PAYMENTS TO 
                   REDRESS INJURY AND LOSS.

       Section 1213(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act 
     for Fiscal Year 2020 (10 U.S.C. 2731 note) is amended by 
     striking ``December 31, 2022&#x27;&#x27; and inserting ``December 31, 
     2023&#x27;&#x27;.

     SEC. 1312. FOREIGN AREA OFFICER ASSESSMENT AND REVIEW.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) Foreign Area Officers of the Army and their equivalent 
     positions in the other Armed Forces (in this section referred 
     to as ``FAOs&#x27;&#x27;) are trained to manage, grow, and enhance 
     security cooperation relationships between the United States 
     and foreign partners and to build the overall military 
     capacity and capabilities of foreign partners.
       (2) At present, some senior defense official positions in 
     United States embassies are filled by officers lacking the 
     necessary skills, training, and experience to strengthen the 
     relationships between the United States and its critical 
     partners and allies.
       (3) FAOs are trained to fill those positions, and 
     deficiencies in the equitable use, assessment, promotion, 
     diversity and inclusion of such officers, as well as 
     limitations on career opportunities, undermine the ability of 
     the Department of Defense to strengthen partnerships and 
     alliances of the United States.
       (4) A federally funded research and development center can 
     provide a roadmap to correcting these deficiencies, 
     strengthening the FAO branch, and placing qualified FAOs in 
     positions of positive influence over United States 
     partnerships and alliances.
       (b) Assessment and Review Required.--
       (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of 
     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall 
     enter into an agreement with a federally funded research and 
     development center to conduct an independent assessment and 
     comprehensive review of the process by which Foreign Area 
     Officers and their equivalent positions in the other Armed 
     Forces (in this section referred to as ``FAOs&#x27;&#x27;) are 
     recruited, selected, trained, assigned, organized, promoted, 
     retained, and used in security cooperation offices, senior 
     defense roles in U.S. embassies, and in other critical roles 
     of engagement with allies and partners.
       (2) Elements.--The assessment and review conducted under 
     paragraph (1) shall include the following:
       (A) Identification and assessment of the number and 
     location of senior defense official billets, including their 
     grade structure and availability to FAOs.
       (B) A review of the cultural, racial, and ethnic diversity 
     of FAOs.
       (C) An assessment of the assignment process for FAOs.
       (D) A review and assessment of the promotion criteria, 
     process, and possible pathways for career advancement for 
     FAOs.

     by geographic region.
       (F) An assessment of the training program for FAOs and its 
     effectiveness.
       (G) An assessment of the available career paths for FAOs.
       (H) An assessment of the criteria used to determine 
     staffing requirements for senior defense official positions 
     and security cooperation roles for uniformed officers.
       (I) A review of the staffing of senior defense official and 
     security cooperation roles and assessment to determine 
     whether requirements are being met through the staffing 
     process.
       (J) An assessment of how the broader utilization of FAOs in 
     key security cooperation and embassy defense leadership 
     billets would improve the quality and professionalism of the 
     security cooperation workforce under section 384 of title 10, 
     United States Code.
       (K) A review of how many FAO opportunities are joint-
     qualifying and an assessment of whether increasing the number 
     of joint-qualified opportunities for FAOs would increase 
     recruitment, retention, and promotion.
       (L) Any other matters the Secretary determines relevant.
       (c) Results.--The federally funded research and development 
     center conducting the assessment and review described in 
     subsection (b) shall submit to the Secretary the results of 
     such assessment and review, which shall include the 
     following:
       (1) A summary of the research and activities undertaken to 
     carry out the assessment required by subsection (b).
       (2) Considerations and recommendations, including 
     legislative recommendations, to achieve the following:
       (A) Improving the assessment, promotion, assignment 
     selection, retention, and diversity of FAOs.

     submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified 
     annex.

       (1) consistent with the Women, Peace, and Security Act of 
     2017 (Public Law 115-68; 131 Stat. 1202) and this section;

       (2) in furtherance of the national security priorities of 
     the United States.
       (b) Professional Military Education.--The Secretary of 
     Defense shall carry out activities consistent with the Women,

     SEC. 1601. IMPROVEMENTS TO TACTICALLY RESPONSIVE SPACE LAUNCH 
                   PROGRAM.

       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) the Space Force, in collaboration with the United 
     States Space Command, the military departments, relevant 
     Defense Agencies and, where practicable, the National 
     Reconnaissance Office, should continue to build on the 
     successful Space Safari tactically responsive launch-2 
     mission of the Space Force, which was a pathfinder to inform 
     concepts of operation regarding tactically responsive 
     launches; and
       (2) future efforts regarding tactically responsive launches 
     should not be limited to only launch capabilities, but should 
     also include all aspects that are needed for rapid 
     reconstitution and responsiveness to urgent requirements with 
     respect to satellite buses, payloads, operations, and ground 
     infrastructure.
       (b) Program.--Section 1609 of the William M. (Mac) 
     Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
     2021 (Public Law 116-283) is amended--
       (1) by striking ``The Secretary&#x27;&#x27; and inserting ``(a) 
     Program.--The Secretary&#x27;&#x27;; and
       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
       ``(b) Support.--
       ``(1) Elements.--The Secretary of Defense, in consultation 
     with the Director of National Intelligence, shall support the 
     tactically responsive launch program under subsection (a) 
     during the period covered by the future-years defense program 
     submitted to Congress under section 221 of title 10, United 
     States Code, in 2022 to ensure that the program addresses the 
     following:
       ``(A) The ability to rapidly place on-orbit systems to

     SEC. 1602. NATIONAL SECURITY SPACE LAUNCH PROGRAM.

       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) the Department of Defense and the National 
     Reconnaissance Office should, to the extent practicable, use 
     launch services under a phase two contract of the National 
     Security Space Launch program; and
       (2) for missions that fall outside of the requirements of 
     phase two of the National Security Space Launch program, the 
     Department of Defense and the National Reconnaissance Office 
     should continue to leverage the growing launch provider base 
     of the United States, including those companies that provide 
     smaller and ride-share launch capabilities, to incentivize 
     sustained investment in domestic launch capabilities.
       (b) Policy.--With respect to entering into contracts for 
     launch services during the period beginning on the date of 
     the enactment of this Act and ending September 30, 2024, it 
     shall be the policy of the Department of Defense and the 
     National Reconnaissance Office to--
       (1) use the National Security Space Launch program to the 
     extent practicable to procure launch services that are met 
     under the requirements of phase two; and
       (2) maximize continuous competition for launch services as 
     the Space Force initiates planning for phase three, 
     specifically for those technology areas that are unique to 
     existing and emerging national security requirements.
       (c) Notification.--If the Secretary of Defense or the 
     Director of the National Reconnaissance Office determines 
     that a program requiring launch services that could be met 
     using phase two contracts will instead use an alternative 
     launch procurement approach, not later than seven days after 
     the date of such determination, the Secretary of Defense or, 
     as appropriate, the Director of National Intelligence, shall 
     submit to the appropriate congressional committees--
       (1) a notification of such determination;
       (2) a certification that the alternative launch procurement 
     approach is in the national security interest of the United

     SEC. 1623. REVIEW OF SAFETY, SECURITY, AND RELIABILITY OF 
                   NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND RELATED SYSTEMS.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) On December 20, 1990, Secretary of Defense Cheney 
     chartered a five-person independent committee known as the 
     Federal Advisory Committee on Nuclear Failsafe and Risk 
     Reduction to assess the capability of the nuclear weapon 
     command and control system to meet the dual requirements of 
     assurance against unauthorized use of nuclear weapons and 
     assurance of timely, reliable execution when authorized, and 
     to identify opportunities for positive measures to enhance 
     failsafe features.
       (2) The Federal Advisory Committee, chaired by Ambassador 
     Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, recommended changes in the nuclear 
     enterprise, as well as policy proposals to reduce the risks 
     posed by unauthorized launches and miscalculation.
       (3) The Federal Advisory Committee found, unambiguously, 
     that ``failsafe and oversight enhancements are possible&#x27;&#x27;.
       (4) Since 1990, new threats to the nuclear enterprise have 
     arisen in the cyber, space, and information warfare domains.
       (5) Ensuring the continued assurance of the nuclear 
     command, control, and communications infrastructure is 
     essential to the national security of the United States.
       (b) Review.--The Secretary of Defense shall provide for the 
     conduct of an independent review of the safety, security, and 
     reliability of covered nuclear systems. The Secretary shall 
     ensure that such review is conducted in a manner similar to 
     the review conducted by the Federal Advisory Committee on 
     Nuclear Failsafe and Risk Reduction.
       (c) Matters Included.--The review conducted pursuant to 
     subsection (b) shall include the following:
       (1) Plans for modernizing the covered nuclear systems, 
     including options and recommendations for technical, 
     procedural, and policy measures that could strengthen 
     safeguards, improve the security and reliability of digital 
     technologies, and prevent cyber-related and other risks that 
     could lead to the unauthorized or inadvertent use of nuclear 
     weapons as the result of an accident, misinterpretation, 
     miscalculation, terrorism, unexpected technological 
     breakthrough, or deliberate act.
       (2) Options and recommendations for nuclear risk reduction 
     measures, focusing on confidence building and predictability, 
     that the United States could carry out alone or with near-
     peer adversaries to strengthen safeguards against the 
     unauthorized or inadvertent use of a nuclear weapon and to 
     reduce nuclear risks.
       (d) Submission.--Not later than one year after the date of 
     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the 
     congressional defense committees the review conducted 
     pursuant to subsection (b).
       (e) Previous Review.--Not later than 30 days after the date 
     of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to 
     the congressional defense committees the final report of the 
     Federal Advisory Committee on Nuclear Failsafe and Risk 
     Reduction.
       (f) Covered Nuclear Systems Defined.--In this section, the 
     term ``covered nuclear systems&#x27;&#x27; means the following systems 
     of the United States:
       (1) The nuclear weapons systems.

       (2) The total development cost of the ground-based 
     strategic deterrent program is expected to be approximately 
     $100,000,000,000.
       (3) The Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff recently 
     noted that ``we have got to make [the ground-based strategic 
     deterrent program] more affordable. A three-stage, solid 
     rocket ICBM should not cost as much as the forecast says it 
     costs for now. After meeting with the program office at 
     Northrop Grumman multiple times I think that program can come 
     in significantly cheaper. It&#x27;s designed correctly. It&#x27;s a 
     digital engineering process that should be able to build 
     things quickly and much more effectively.&#x27;&#x27;.
       (4) The Air Force has placed significant importance on 
     digital engineering in achieving cost and schedule 
     requirements with respect to the ground-based strategic 
     deterrent program.
       (b) Review.--
       (1) Requirement.--The Secretary of the Air Force shall 
     provide for the conduct of a review of the implementation and

     deterrent program.
       (B) A review of the challenges the Air Force faces in 
     implementing such industry best practices.
       (C) A review of the ability of the Air Force to leverage 
     digital engineering during such engineering and manufacturing 
     development phase.
       (D) A review of any options that may be available to the 
     Air Force to reduce cost and introduce competition within the 
     operations and maintenance phase of the ground-based 
     strategic deterrent program.
       (E) Recommendations to improve the cost, schedule, and 
     program management of the ground-based strategic deterrent 
     program.
       (3) Expertise.--The Secretary shall ensure that the review 
     under paragraph (1) is conducted by individuals from the 
     public and private sector, including not fewer than two 
     individuals--
       (A) who are not employees or officers of the Department of 
     Defense or a contractor of the Department; and
       (B) who have experience outside of the defense industry.

                  Subtitle D--Missile Defense Programs

     SEC. 1641. DIRECTED ENERGY PROGRAMS FOR BALLISTIC AND 
                   HYPERSONIC MISSILE DEFENSE.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) In the fiscal year 2021 budget request of the 
     Department of Defense, the Secretary of Defense removed all 
     funding from the Missile Defense Agency to conduct research, 
     engineering, or development for directed energy technologies 
     that could be applicable for ballistic and hypersonic missile 
     defense, and this removal of funding continued in the fiscal 
     year 2022 budget request of the Department, despite Congress 
     appropriating funding for fiscal year 2021 for these efforts.
       (2) In January 2020, an independent Senior Executive Review 
     Team noted that ``If successfully developed, the unique 
     features of diode pumped alkali laser, an efficient 
     electrically powered, relatively short wavelength gas laser 
     with the potential to deliver megawatt power with near 
     diffraction limited beam quality from a single aperture would 
     provide the Department of Defense and the Missile Defense 
     Agency with an important strategic technology with the 
     potential for an attractive size, weight, and power. Such a 
     system would have potential capability use cases across all 
     services/agencies.&#x27;&#x27;. However, the Under Secretary of Defense 
     for Research and Engineering did not support continued 
     investigation of this promising technology by the Missile 
     Defense Agency.
       (3) In addition to diode pumped alkali lasers, there are 
     other directed energy applications that have the potential to 
     contribute to ballistic and hypersonic missile defense 
     architecture, including microwave and short pulse lasers 
     technologies.
       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
     the Director of the Missile Defense Agency should continue to 
     fund promising directed energy technologies for ballistic and 
     hypersonic missile defense, in coordination with the directed 
     energy roadmap of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research 
     and Engineering, with the intent to transfer technologies to 
     the military departments as appropriate.
       (c) Authority of the Missile Defense Agency.--
       (1) Delegation.--The Secretary of Defense shall delegate to 
     the Director of the Missile Defense Agency the authority to 
     budget for, direct, and manage directed energy programs 
     applicable for ballistic and hypersonic missile defense 
     missions, in coordination with other directed energy efforts 
     of the Department of Defense.
       (2) Prioritization.--In budgeting for and directing 
     directed energy programs applicable for ballistic and 
     hypersonic defensive missions pursuant to paragraph (1), the 
     Director of the Missile Defense Agency shall--
       (A) prioritize the early research and development of 
     technologies; and
       (B) address the transition of such technologies to industry 
     to support future operationally relevant capabilities.

     systems for both nuclear and non-nuclear strategic systems; 
     and
       (B) develop a policy for more consistently applying such

     countries suffocated by corrupt bureaucracies.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, is debatable for 1 
hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking 
minority member of the Committee on Armed Services or their respective 
designees.
  The gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. Rogers) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.


                             General Leave

  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous material on <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 4350</a>.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Washington?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.
  Madam Speaker, we have before us the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2022, and I highly recommend it to the Members of 
the House and urge everybody to support this incredibly important and 
very well put together piece of legislation.

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4794">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4794">H4794</a></a>]]

  

  The first thing I will say is thank you to all of the staff, 
certainly on the Armed Services Committee, but the Rules Committee as 
well, and the leadership staff. This has been a truly bipartisan 
legislative process.
  We had our markup in committee which lasted, I will do a little quick 
math in my head, something like 16 hours. We considered over 800 
amendments, with a variety of different variations, and we got that 
number up closer to 1100. And then before the Rules Committee there 
were, again, over 800 amendments submitted, and we have worked with 
Members of this body, Democrats and Republicans, members on the 
committee and off, to craft what I think is a very good piece of 
legislation.
  I think it is incredibly important, first of all, that we pass this 
bill so that Congress continues to exercise its authority to exercise 
oversight over the Department of Defense.
  I know Members on both sides of this aisle have lamented throughout 
the years the degree to which the executive branch has exerted more 
power over the years, where the legislative branch has exhibited less. 
Now, granted, you find that issue more troubling when the opposite 
party is in charge of the White House, but we are all troubled by that 
phenomena.
  We need to exercise our authority; this bill does that. To my mind, 
Congress does not pass enough authorizing bills, but we do do so in the 
Department of Defense, and have done so for over 60 straight years, and 
should do so again.
  This bill, I think, is particularly important because we are at an 
important moment in defense of this country and in dealing with our 
role in the world. We have never faced a more complex threat 
environment. We have threats from Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and 
transnational terrorist groups.
  In addition, we are now coming out of 20 years of war fought in Iraq 
and Afghanistan, both countries of which our military now is out and 
not fighting those wars, and we have a whole bunch of change to deal 
with.
  

  At the same time, innovation has never been more important in 
properly defending this country. We need to update and modernize our 
armed forces, everything from our information systems, to our command 
and control, to our platforms, to the support we give to our 
servicemembers. I am very proud that this bill reflects those 
priorities.
  And the work has been done between Mr. Rogers and myself and members 
of the committee to produce that product. And I want to take a moment 
here to thank Mr. Rogers, the ranking member, he has been a terrific 
partner in this process, as has his staff and as has his members.
  I think this bill reflects those priorities. It figures out how to 
improve our ability to update the military more quickly, to better buy 
software, to better innovate, to better embrace the innovative 
technologies that we need.
  Madam Speaker, I want to particularly thank Mr. Langevin, as the 
subcommittee chair, who has taken the lead on the AI task force that 
looks at this question in great specificity. This bill really puts us 
in a position to modernize the force as we need to.
  One other crucial issue that we do in this is we address the issue of 
sexual assault in the military that continues to be a scourge upon 
service in the military. We have worked for years to try to address 
this issue, we have not been successful.
  This year, thanks in large part to the leadership of Congresswoman 
Speier, we have updated the UCMJ to create a special victims&#x27; 
prosecutor to give sexual assault and sex crimes the attention they 
deserve to make sure that we are protecting the men and women who serve 
in the military. It is a crucial aspect of this bill, and I strongly 
urge Members to support it.
  Lastly, let me just say that as you pore over this bill, everybody 
here will find something that they do not like. Everybody here will 
also find something that they wish was in there that is not. There is 
no doubt about that, because it is a very large bill, and it was a 
collaborative process.
  But it is the nature of the legislative process that you don&#x27;t get 
absolutely everything that you want. I hope Members will keep that in 
mind. But it is also the nature of the legislative process, in this 
case, that we have produced a product that everybody in this House can 
be proud of.
  And, again, I want to thank my Republican counterpart. We have worked 
together to produce this. I urge support from all Members. This is a 
bill every Member, Democrat and Republican, can enthusiastically 
support, and I reserve the balance of my time.
                                         House of Representatives,


                            Committee on House Administration,

       Dear Chairman Smith: I am writing to you concerning <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 
     4350</a>, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
     2022. There are certain provisions in the legislation that 
     fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the House Judiciary 
     Committee.
       In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed 
     expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill, 
     I am willing to waive this committee&#x27;s right to sequential 
     referral. I do so with the understanding that by waiving 
     consideration of the bill, the House Judiciary Committee does 
     not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the subject 
     matters contained in the bill which fall within its Rule X 
     jurisdiction. I request that you urge the Speaker to name 
     members of this committee to any conference committee which 
     is named to consider such provisions.
       Please place this letter into the committee report on <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 
     4350</a> and into the Congressional Record during consideration

     <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 4350</a>, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
     Year 2022. I agree that the Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs 
     has valid jurisdictional claims to certain provisions in this 
     important legislation, and I am most appreciative of your 
     decision not to request a referral in the interest of 
     expediting consideration of the bill. I agree that by 
     foregoing a sequential referral, the Committee on Veterans&#x27; 
     Affairs is not waiving its jurisdiction. Further, this 
     exchange of letters will be included in the committee report 
     on the bill.
           Sincerely,
                                                       Adam Smith,
     Chairman.

                                         House of Representatives,


                                  Committee on Armed Services,

                                Washington, DC, September 9, 2021.
     Hon. Adam B. Schiff,
     Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, 
         Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Schiff: Thank you for your letter regarding 
     <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 4350</a>, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal

     that by foregoing a sequential referral, the Permanent Select 
     Committee on Intelligence is not waiving its jurisdiction. 
     Further, this exchange of letters will be included in the

           Sincerely,
                                                       Adam Smith,
                                                         Chairman.

  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I, too, rise in strong support of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 4350</a>, the 
fiscal year National Defense Authorization Act.
  <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 4350</a> represents a truly bipartisan bill, and I want to thank 
Chairman Smith for his tremendous leadership and cooperation in helping 
fashion it. This has been a truly bipartisan endeavor.

                              {time}  2115

  Over the last few months, we have seen the best of our soldiers, 
sailors, airmen, marines, and guardians. They have performed in the 
toughest of environments with the greatest level of skill and 
professionalism. Many gave their lives so others would have a chance 
for a better life. Without a doubt, our military is the greatest force 
the world has ever seen.
  Providing the authorities and resources for our service that our 
servicemembers need to defend our Nation and defeat our adversaries is 
the greatest responsibility we have here in Congress. We accomplished 
that responsibility with the bill before us today. <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 4350</a> ensures 
our warfighters are the best equipped and trained in the world.
  The bill puts our servicemembers first, providing a 2.7 percent pay 
increase and expanding benefits for their families. It also puts 
American workers first with historic investments in our defense 
industrial base. It also begins divesting legacy systems that will not 
help us deter future threats. Instead, it invests in new technologies 
like AI, hypersonics, and quantum computing that will help us stay 
ahead of our adversaries.
  That is important because Russia and China are rapidly modernizing 
their militaries. China is outpacing us with advancements in emerging 
technologies and weapons systems, and we know China isn&#x27;t building 
these capabilities purely for defense. In recent years, we have seen 
China use its military to push out its borders, threaten our allies, 
and gain footholds on new continents.
  <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 4350</a> is laser-focused on preparing our military to prevail in a 
conflict with China. It makes critical investments in new systems 
capable of surviving in a contested environment. It includes provisions 
that will remove China from our defense supply chain, and it reaffirms 
our support to allies in the region, especially Taiwan. Unfortunately, 
threats from near peer adversaries like China and Russia are not the 
only ones we face. Terrorists continue their plots to destroy our way 
of life, and we must continue to take the fight to them anywhere and 
anytime they threaten us. With strong investments in new capabilities 
and readiness, this bill enables our warfighters to do just that.
  Finally, regardless of how you feel about the war in Afghanistan, 
Madam Speaker, I think we are all horrified by its disastrous 
withdrawal. This bill includes over 20 provisions to provide 
accountability to get us answers to questions we have been asking for 
here for months.
  This is a strong, bipartisan bill that will enhance our oversight of 
the DOD and ensure our military is properly resourced and equipped to 
defend our Nation and our allies.
  Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the National Defense 
Authorization Act. I commend Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4799">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4799">H4799</a></a>]]

for their bipartisan cooperation in bringing the bill to the floor. I 
also want to thank Ranking Member Banks and former Ranking Member 
Stefanik for their bipartisan collaboration this year. I would also 
like to thank the members of the Cyber, Innovative Technologies, and 
Information Systems Subcommittee for their hard work, particularly Vice 
Chair Houlahan.
  Thanks to the work of my subcommittee, this legislation harnesses 
cutting-edge technology to benefit our warfighters and our national 
security. This legislation includes a 36 percent increase in defense-
wide basic and applied research and development and significant 
increases for historically Black colleges and universities.
  This bill also includes many provisions recommended by the National 
Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, which I offered as a 
package of amendments during our committee markup. We are taking 
important steps in addressing the promises and challenges of this 
powerful technology, and I am thankful for the commission cochairs, 
Secretary Bob Work and Dr. Eric Schmidt, and members of that committee 
as well for their service.
  The NDAA builds off the important work of the Cyberspace Solarium 
Commission by establishing the Joint Collaborative Environment at the 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, called CISA. This 
program, which will live at the newly established Joint Cyber Defense 
Collaborative, or JCDC, will facilitate public-private cooperation in 
analyzing cyber threats.
  Beyond the CITI provisions, the NDAA fully funds the Virginia-class 
and Columbia-class submarine programs which are crucial to our 
deterrence posture against China. I am so proud to represent the Rhode 
Islanders who construct these amazing vessels and do their part in 
keeping us safe.
  I am also proud of the reforms we made to the Uniform Code of 
Military Justice to address sexual assault and extremism and of our 
efforts to defend our military infrastructure against climate change. 
These achievements would not be possible, of course, without the work 
of my subcommittee staff: staff lead Michael Hermann; Bess Dopkeen, 
Troy Nienberg, and Josh Stiefel.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from 
Rhode Island an additional 30 seconds.
  Mr. LANGEVIN. I also thank minority staff, Sarah Moxley. Our clerk, 
Caroline Kehrli, is departing the subcommittee, and her work has been 
incredibly invaluable. My legislative director, Caroline Goodson, and 
military fellow, Juliann Hitt, also made significant contributions to 
the bill.
  Madam Speaker, Chairman Smith has, once again, done a masterful job 
leading us through this process, and I urge all of my colleagues to 
support the NDAA.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Turner).
  Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, I support the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022. Thanks to the leadership of 
Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers, as well as the chairman of 
the Strategic Forces Subcommittee,   Jim Cooper, this year&#x27;s NDAA was, 
once again, compiled and reported for consideration on the floor today 
in a bipartisan manner. This bill is also the product of the diligent 
work of the committee staff whom I would like to thank including the 
Strategic Forces Subcommittee&#x27;s PSMs, Maria Vastola, Grant Schneider, 
Ryan Tully, Whitney Verett, and Zach Taylor, as well as the committee&#x27;s 
majority staff director, Paul Arcangeli, and minority staff director, 
Chris Vieson.
  Admiral Richard, the Commander of U.S. Strategic Command, has told us 
we are facing a situation our Nation has not encountered before. We 
must deter two peer nuclear-capable competitors simultaneously and must 
do so with each being deterred differently. I am confident that the FY 
2022 NDAA before us today places us on the right path to properly 
observe both Russia and China.
  First and foremost, the bill increases top line defense spending by 
nearly $25 billion, reversing the harmful and reckless cuts from the 
President&#x27;s budget, ensuring an annual growth of 5 percent over the 
previous year, and funding the DOD&#x27;s most critical unfunded priorities.
  Next, with one exception, the NDAA continues to fully fund programs 
within the Department of Defense and Department of Energy that 
modernize the Nation&#x27;s nuclear triad and modernize the nuclear command, 
control, and communications systems. This is especially critical to 
maintaining a safe, secure, and reliable strategic deterrent while 
China is undergoing an unprecedented and massive nuclear build-up and 
Russia is undertaking significant modernization of all three legs of 
its triad. Also, both Russia and China are developing brand-new, novel 
nuclear delivery systems.
  This NDAA fully funds capabilities necessary for the defense of Guam 
and prohibits reduction of our ICBM inventory while simultaneously 
halting efforts to retire or reconvert our low-yield nuclear warheads, 
which are currently deployed in defense of our Nation. And this NDAA 
reverses President Biden&#x27;s detrimental and dangerous budgetary cuts to 
our missile defense systems.
  Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members to support this bill.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Maine (Mr. Golden), who is a member of the committee.
  Mr. GOLDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022.
  This measure, which passed out of our committee with a strong 
bipartisan vote, reflects our commitment to strengthening our national 
security and serving those who serve all of us.
  I am particularly proud of the efforts of the Seapower and Projection 
Forces Subcommittee. This bill reflects the constructive input of 
members of the subcommittee from both sides of the aisle and makes a 
strong mark on our national security priorities on, above, and below 
the seas.
  For shipbuilding, the bill expands on the budget request to authorize 
13 battle force ships. This reflects our committee&#x27;s focused effort to 
scrub the budget and our shipbuilding plans to augment our Navy fleet 
responsibly and consistently in a manner which our industrial base can 
support to respond to emerging threats around the world. This includes 
the sustained construction of two Virginia-class submarines a year and 
continued production of the Columbia-class submarine program. We 
augment our surface capabilities by authorizing three new DDG 51 
destroyers, one of our most capable surface platforms, and authorizing 
the Navy to seek a new contract for up to 15 ships over the next 5 
years.
  This bill also continues the committee&#x27;s efforts to provide the Navy 
and Defense Department with tools needed to concurrently build the new 
12 sub Columbia class without suffocating the rest of the Navy&#x27;s fleet. 
Specifically, the bill expands the authority of the National Sea-Based 
Deterrence Fund to allow for multiyear, continuous production of key 
components. Recent data from the Navy shows that the use of this 
authority since our subcommittee enacted it in 2015 has already saved 
the Navy $1.4 billion in the Columbia program to the tune of over $100 
million per boat. This bill will increase those cost savings by 
expanding the scope of those tools to other components of the platform.
  The bill also includes full funding to start the new sealift Tanker 
Security Program, an initiative we passed last year to get more U.S.-
built tankers to sea. The bill supports the budget request for the 
fifth planned National Security Multi-Mission Vessel, another 
initiative to boost maritime training and sealift capacity.
  At every step of the way, our subcommittee and the full committee 
accommodated many bipartisan initiatives throughout this process. That 
is how the legislative process should work, and we are proud that our 
committee remains a place for constructive bipartisan collaboration.
  Madam Speaker, on behalf of our Nation&#x27;s security, I urge support for 
the bill.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), who is the ranking member of the 
Readiness Subcommittee.
  Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4800">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4800">H4800</a></a>]]

  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 4350</a>. We have 
maintained the bipartisan tradition of the Armed Services Committee.
  Now, while this administration promotes weakness abroad and tyranny 
at home, robust support for defense in this bill ensures that our 
adversaries understand that our military has the resources required to 
stymy their aggressive ambitions which will guarantee that our military 
will succeed if called upon.
  This legislation will enhance readiness by funding the unfunded 
requests of the services and the co-coms. It will maintain our 
commitment to the nuclear triad and modernization and aggressively 
enhance our space capabilities. It protects our troops against 
punishment for personal politics, prohibits dishonorable discharge for 
COVID vaccination refusal, and requires a plan for exemptions. And it 
begins to hold the Biden administration accountable for Afghanistan.

  Now, while this bill fosters U.S.-Israeli cooperation, including $300 
million for multiple collaborative programs, anti-Israel Democrats have 
stripped the continuing resolution of $1 billion for the Iron Dome 
missile defense system.
  What does it say about the Progressive Caucus that they object to 
Israeli citizens defending themselves from missile attacks?
  It is reprehensible and anti-Semitic.
  Nevertheless, this bill as it currently stands is a bipartisan bill.
  I thank the chairman and ranking member for maintaining the 
collaborative nature of our committee. I want to thank especially the 
chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee,   John Garamendi, for his 
leadership and commitment to bipartisanship. I thank my readiness team, 
Ian, Dave, and Whitney, for their invaluable hard work during this 
process.
  Madam Speaker, I encourage a ``yes&#x27;&#x27; vote.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi), who is the chairman of the 
Readiness Subcommittee.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of the fiscal 
year 2022 NDAA. I would like to start by thanking Chairman Smith; 
Ranking Member Rogers; and my colleague on the subcommittee, Mr. 
Lamborn; and, of course, the House Armed Services staff who have worked 
many long nights putting this NDAA together. The bill that is before 
the House is a good bill, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.
  The jurisdiction of the Readiness Subcommittee covers a broad range 
of topics from civilian personnel, sustainment, and contested logistics 
to military construction, energy safety and environmental policy. With 
that in mind, I would just like to highlight some of the issues we have 
dealt with.
  Consistent with our work over the last 2 years, the readiness 
provisions continue efforts to address the climate change challenges of 
extreme weather and the necessity to reduce the greenhouse gas emitted 
by the U.S. military--the largest single emitter in the world. We 
require each installation to develop a master plan to do these things.
  The health and safety of our servicemembers will always be a top 
priority of the subcommittee. The bill elevates the department&#x27;s focus 
on safety by establishing the Joint Safety Council and requiring the 
DOD to develop a plan for the establishment of a Mishap Investigation 
Review Board to provide oversight and independent review of safety and 
mishap investigations.
  This mark continues the subcommittee&#x27;s work to improve the conditions 
for the servicemembers and their quality-of-life infrastructures, such 
as military family housing, barracks, and child development centers.
  We also step up the military&#x27;s requirement to address the PFAS 
contamination on and off bases.
  The bill helps advance our military&#x27;s near-term readiness goals and 
drives the department to plan for and take action against long-term 
threats.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the fiscal year 2022 
NDAA.
  Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of the fiscal year 2022 
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). I would like to start by 
thanking Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Rogers, and the House Armed 
Services Committee staff who have worked many long nights putting 
together this year&#x27;s NDAA. The bill that is before the House is a good 
bill, and I encourage my colleagues to support its passage.
  As the Chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, I believe the bill 
upholds our responsibility to provide congressional oversight of and 
support to the sustainment, logistics, infrastructure, and readiness of 
our military. I&#x27;d like to take a moment and thank my staff for their 
tireless work--the Readiness Subcommittee staff, Jeanine Womble, 
Melanie Harris, Jay Vallario, Wendell White, Ian Bennitt, Dave 
Sienicki, and Sean Falvey, and my personal staff, Betsy Thompson, 
Rebecca Wolf, and Scott Bohn. I am proud of the Readiness 
Subcommittee&#x27;s contribution to this year&#x27;s bill, and I&#x27;d like to 
highlight the following provisions.
  Consistent with our work from the last two years, the Readiness 
provisions in the NDAA continue efforts to address the climate change 
challenges of extreme weather and the necessity to reduce the 
greenhouse gases emitted by the U.S. military, the largest single 
entity in the world. The bill:
  Requires each military department to complete installation master 
plans at two of their most at-risk installations within one year of 
enactment;
  Requires the Department to amend DOD building codes to require 
consideration of microgrids with islanding capability as part of 
planned new construction, and encourages the department to renegotiate 
contracts related to existing on-installation renewable energy projects 
to enhance installation resiliency during power disruptions;
  Requires installation commanders to consult with local governments to 
ensure installation master plans include outside the fence line 
resiliency considerations;
  Requires the Department to assess energy and water usage at existing 
data centers and set conservation goals for new data centers; and
  Requires the Department to include EV charging infrastructure needs 
in their planning for new domestic military construction, and requires 
the Department to adopt industry standard planning considerations in 
the development and rollout of charging infrastructure at military 
installations.
  The bill also builds on efforts to address contested logistics 
challenges involving near-peer competitors by strengthening operational 
energy programs:
  Requires the Department to create a working group of program 
planners, energy staff, joint staff, and geographic combatant commands 
to enhance integration of military department energy initiatives into 
operational planning and platform development to combat contested 
logistics challenges;
  Requires the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, 
Installations, and Environment to report on alternative fuels and 
mandates the conduct of a wholistic review of the associated 
production, transportation, geopolitical, commercial, and research and 
development of alternative energy; and
  Requires the Secretary of Defense to designate a Combatant Command as 
the agency responsible for global bulk fuel storage, delivery, and 
distribution, and directs the so-designated Combatant Command to 
conduct a strategy on the infrastructure and programs necessary to 
optimally support global bulk fuel management of the Department of 
Defense.
  The FY22 NDAA also builds on the Committee&#x27;s previous legislative and 
oversight activities to address poor conditions in barracks, child 
development centers and housing:
  Requires the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, 
Installations, and Environment to report on and provide a list of 
domestic facilities and average facility childcare wait list, assess 
efforts to find solutions and reduce wait times, assess the extent to 
which staffing availability impacts childcare availability, and assess 
whether including childcare facilities in agreements for new private 
housing would be an effective solution;
  Requires the military departments to conduct safety inspections and 
develop 10-year facility improvement plans for child development 
centers; and
  Requires the Department to place higher priority on the sustainment 
of quality-of-life facilities such as barracks by setting aside a 
percentage of infrastructure sustainment funds for that purpose.
  Additionally, the bill builds on the committee&#x27;s oversight activities 
to address preventable training accidents and build a culture of safety 
in the military departments:
  Establishes a Joint Safety Council within the Office of the Deputy 
Secretary of Defense that advises on all operational safety matters, 
establishes safety standards, collects and analyzes safety data, and 
develops safety priorities;
  Addresses concerns about the quality and objectivity of the military 
department&#x27;s mishap investigations by directing the Deputy Secretary of 
Defense to develop a plan for the establishment of a Mishap 
Investigation Review

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4801">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4801">H4801</a></a>]]

Board, which would provide oversight and independent review of mishap 
investigations;
  Requires the Secretaries of the Army and Marine Corps to develop a 
plan to address the recommendations contained in GAO&#x27;s recent report on 
tactical vehicle mishaps; and
  Requires the Secretary of Defense to review the risks, benefits, and 
plans for enhancing the protections for combat uniforms in an effort to 
protect service members from flash fires.
  Furthermore, the bill continues efforts to address contamination 
associated with per- and polyfluorinated compounds on and around 
military installations:
  Requires the Department of Defense to review current practices to 
prevent or mitigate AFFF spills and promulgate best practices for spill 
prevention and mitigation, enterprise wide;
  Increases transparency and facilitates information-sharing with 
defense communities impacted by PFAS contamination; and
  Places a temporary moratorium on the incineration of PFAS-
contaminated materials until DOD adopts and promulgates EPA interim 
guidance for disposal.
  The bill continues to build on efforts to support the Department of 
Defense civilian workforce:
  Requires the Secretary of Defense to provide a report detailing the 
number of military, civilian, and contractor personnel assigned to or 
employed by OSD over the past ten years, to assess whether the number 
of civilian billets in OSD-Policy has kept pace with changes in the 
organization&#x27;s mission over time, and to provide a recommendation as to 
whether an increase to OSD&#x27;s statutory personnel caps is necessary to 
ensure sufficient civilian staffing and enable corrective action for 
any inappropriate contracting;
  Prohibits changes to the size or function of the Naval Audit Service 
until the Comptroller General completes a report on the operations of 
the Naval Audit Service;
  Requires the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan to address the 
recommendations contained in the Comptroller General of the United 
States report entitled ``Sexual Harassment and Assault: Guidance Needed 
to Ensure Consistent Tracking, Response, and Training for Department of 
Defense Civilians;&#x27;&#x27; and
  Requires that the Secretary of Defense to establish relevant metrics, 
collect and report on diversity statistics, and report on the status of 
diversity and inclusion efforts among the civilian work force.
  The bill also continues efforts to ensure modern weapons systems are 
sustainable and affordable over time and to support our industrial 
base:
  Requires the Comptroller General to report on organic maintenance 
capability and capacity within the F-35 program including depot 
standup, technical data requirements, unique tooling, and contractor 
assistance in depot standup; assess the potential to transition supply-
chain management from a contractor-led to a government-led function, 
and; assess key field-level maintenance challenges as well as 
mitigating actions.
  Requires the Comptroller General to provide annual reports in the 
years 2022-2025 on the F-35 program sustainment system, including an 
analysis of the sustainment strategy, an analysis of the Department&#x27;s 
ability to reduce costs toward affordability metrics, and an analysis 
of the Department&#x27;s efforts to provide oversight of key contractor-led 
sustainment functions.
  Requires the Secretary of Defense to initiate a pilot program to 
develop a digital twin of the facilities and operations of at least one 
government-owned and operated military depot that is not a shipyard.
  Requires the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, 
Logistics, and Technology to review efforts to digitize field-level 
maintenance for ground vehicles.
  The FY22 NDAA supports the missions at Travis and Beale Air Force 
Bases in my district, and I&#x27;m also pleased this NDAA includes a 2.7 
percent pay raise for our troops. Additional provisions that I was 
instrumental in securing include:
  Requiring the Secretary of Defense to continue the FireGuard program, 
where the National Guard assists in detecting and monitoring wildfires, 
for at least the next five years;
  Including bill language that adds transparency to the Civil Reserve 
Air Fleet program, and that aligns requirements for charter 
transportation of both Department of Defense personnel and cargo;
  Prohibiting the use of open-air burn pits during overseas contingency 
operations unless an exemption is issued by the President of The United 
States for a particular location. Thirty days after an exemption is 
granted, the President would be required to submit a report to Congress 
detailing the location, size, duration, and need of the burn pit, the 
number of personnel assigned to the location, and the personal 
protective equipment or other methods that will be used by those 
personnel to mitigate the health effects of said pit;
  Directing the Department to pay fees associated with the transfer of 
adopted dogs to the adoption agency or individual and directing the 
inclusion of veterinary care and services into the Joint Trauma 
Education and Training Directorate;
  Including significant Facilities Sustainment, Restoration, and 
Modernization (FSRM) projects on DOD&#x27;s online listing of military 
construction projects and MILCON contracting awards; and
  Authorizing the Maritime Administrator to use appropriated funds to 
purchase duplicate medals authorized under the Merchant Mariners of 
World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2020. This awards the 
Congressional Gold Medal--one of our nation&#x27;s highest honors--to the 
Merchant Marine Veterans of World War II.
  This bill helps advance our military&#x27;s near-term readiness goals and 
drives the Department to plan for and take action against long-term 
threats, and with that, I urge my colleagues to support the FY22 NDAA.

                              {time}  2130

  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman), the ranking member of the 
Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee.
  Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.
  I want to preface by saying that I do not agree with everything in 
this bill, but the committee-passed bill is worthy of support.
  I want to especially thank Ranking Member Rogers and Chairman Smith 
for their attention to minimizing extraneous provisions in the markup 
that have little to do with our national security or supporting our 
servicemembers. Our struggle to close conference last year because of 
these issues were wholly associated with provisions that are not 
connected to national security. And these attempts, I believe, were 
offensive, and similar attempts to include these unnecessary provisions 
this year should be rebuffed.
  Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi has not listened to the lessons learned 
from last year&#x27;s conference and has decided to add several non-germane 
bills to the NDAA at Rules that have nothing to do with defense.
  I want to make this clear for my colleagues offering these 
amendments: We should not use servicemembers as a tool to achieve 
partisan gain. I repeat: We should not use servicemembers as a tool to 
achieve partisan gain. And I voted in opposition to the rule, but I 
hope that I can vote for final passage of this year&#x27;s NDAA.
  As to the committee mark, we started with an anemic budget request 
from the Biden administration that in the Seapower portfolio requested 
only eight ships, two of which were fleet tugboats. How the 
administration can set China as the pacing threat and reduce Navy force 
structure is simply baffling.
  Fortunately, with the leadership of Ranking Member Rogers and others 
on the committee, we were able to authorize additional funds to the 
defense top line to provide the real growth necessary to dissuade 
future conflict. With this, we authorized 13 battle force ships and 
rebuffed the administration&#x27;s request to retire three cruisers.
  Additionally, we sought to expand the submarine industrial base by 
authorizing funds that enable a submarine construction build rate of 
three by 2025. The mark also includes critical capabilities to support 
our Nation&#x27;s deterrence with continued strong investments in the 
Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine and the B-21 Raider bomber.
  I think this is a good bill in its current form, and it is worthy of 
my colleagues&#x27; support.
  MR. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes 
just to address a couple things the gentleman from Virginia said.
  I want to be clear, it is the longstanding practice of our committee 
that we take issues that are not in our jurisdiction. We have done it 
under Republican leadership. We have done it under Democratic 
leadership.
  It is also the longstanding practice of our committee to work with 
the committees of jurisdiction, and only if in a bipartisan, bicameral 
way those committees of jurisdiction agree, does it ultimately go into 
the conference report. So you don&#x27;t need to be afraid of stuff that you 
don&#x27;t like. Work with

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4802">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4802">H4802</a></a>]]

your committees of jurisdiction and it goes into the conference report 
if we get agreement. If it doesn&#x27;t, it doesn&#x27;t.
  Second, last year that is not what held us up. The two things that 
held us up last year were one thing that was very much within the 
jurisdiction of this committee, and that was whether or not to rename 
military bases; to change the names of the bases named for 
Confederates, very much in our jurisdiction.
  And the second thing was President Trump&#x27;s last-second desire, out of 
nowhere, to add section 230 to the bill. We weren&#x27;t held up by these 
things, and we will not be held up this year. If the committees of 
jurisdiction do not agree, we don&#x27;t do it. We just have that 
negotiation. If they can, we give them a ride. So don&#x27;t need to worry 
about that. It is a good bill. Go ahead and vote for it.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. Speier), the chairwoman of the Military Personnel Subcommittee.
  Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I am proud to speak in support of this 
bill which passed out of our committee with overwhelming bipartisan 
support.
  This year&#x27;s NDAA continues the committee&#x27;s tradition of improving the 
lives of servicemembers and their families by supporting a 2.7 percent 
pay raise; increasing parental leave for new mothers and fathers, 
including adoptive and foster parents; expanding financial assistance 
for in-home child care; improving the legal representation for 
exceptional family members; and demanding an independent review of 
suicides.
  Following the horrifying murder of Specialist Vanessa Guillen and a 
ground swell of activism from survivors of military sexual trauma, <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 
4350</a> also boldly confronts sexual assault and harassment in the 
military, which has been one of my top priorities for a decade, by 
removing the commander from decisions related to prosecution of special 
victim crimes, improving sexual harassment investigations, and 
continuing to improve military criminal investigative resources.
  It also establishes standalone offenses for sexual harassment and 
violent extremism under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
  These reforms will increase trust in the military justice system and 
encourage survivors of sexual violence to come forward. The bill also 
requires an independent review of whether to transfer additional 
offenses such as murder that are out of the chain of command.
  Where servicemembers serve, so do their families. That has been our 
mantra on this subcommittee, which is why this bill ensures that the 
military health system continues to have sufficient providers to meet 
beneficiaries&#x27; healthcare needs.
  <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 4350</a> also improves services covered under TRICARE, including 
contraception, without copays.
  Together, servicemembers and their families make sacrifices for our 
Nation, and we must continue our commitment to them.
  I want to thank the ranking member, Congressman   Mike Gallagher, the 
extraordinary staff of the committee: Ilka Regino, David Giachetti, 
Hannah Kaufman, Glen Diehl, and the fearless Staff Director Paul 
Arcangeli, and also Josh Connolly and Brian Collins from my staff.
  Thanks to Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers for an 
extraordinary NDAA.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), the ranking member of the 
Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee.
  Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, each year Congress considers one of the 
most important pieces of legislation, the National Defense 
Authorization Act. I applaud the bipartisan leadership of Chairman Adam 
Smith and Ranking Member   Mike Rogers.
  And as the ranking member of the Tactical Air and Land Forces 
Subcommittee, I want to thank our subcommittee chairman,   Donald 
Norcross, for his collaborative, bipartisan efforts.
  I am pleased the committee approved a bipartisan amendment in markup 
to increase the top line by $23.9 billion. This increase is needed to 
continue the progress we have made in rebuilding readiness and will 
facilitate modernization programs necessary to prepare our military 
forces to compete with, deter, and win against peer challengers and 
adversaries.
  Under the subcommittee&#x27;s jurisdiction, this bill continues critical 
oversight of the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps&#x27; strike-fighter 
force structure and inventory management, setting better conditions for 
ensuring the right mix of fourth and fifth generation fighters, and 
managing operational risk. Specifically, this legislation authorizes 
funding for 80 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, 24 F-15EX aircraft, and 12 
F/A-18 Super Hornets.
  The legislation also reverses several proposed cuts, including 
procurement for the Army&#x27;s small caliber ammunition accounts. It also 
facilitates stronger oversight to ensure current ISR and counter UAS 
capabilities and capacity are maintained and prioritized to mitigate 
near-term operational risk and prevent future capability gaps.
  Outside the subcommittee&#x27;s jurisdiction, I am pleased that this bill 
includes several provisions regarding the disastrous withdrawal from 
Afghanistan, including my provision requiring an accounting of the 
decision to leave Bagram Air Base.
  I am also pleased this legislation includes two of my bills, the 
CADET Act and the Connecting the Community to End Military Suicide Act.
  I do have concerns with several provisions in the underlying bill, 
including the selective service, and I am hopeful we can work in a 
bipartisan manner to address those. I encourage support.
  MR. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross), the chair of 
the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee.
  Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his work and 
commitment to this country&#x27;s security.
  Madam Speaker, this bill continues the long, proud tradition of 
bipartisan work for the Tactical Air and Land Subcommittee; our 
commitment to securing our Nation and willingness to work through and 
share responsibility for the tough choices resulting in this bill, a 
bill that keeps America&#x27;s land and air forces the best in the world.
  I particularly want to thank our ranking member, Mrs. Hartzler, for 
her input, her steadfast support in building this strong, bipartisan 
bill. Certainly, though we may disagree at times, we put the safety and 
security of our Nation and servicemen first and work together to pass 
this vital piece of legislation.
  I also want to thank our vice chair, Representative Sherrill of New 
Jersey, for her help.
  Madam Speaker, this bill equips and modernizes our Armed Forces by 
carefully and thoughtfully managing resources. At the same time, this 
bill continues the necessary oversight to ensure responsibility of the 
execution by the DOD. This bill enacts: Vigorous oversight of our most 
complex and expensive program, the F-35, certainly an ambitious 
modernization strategy by the Army and a host of others; and of 
particular importance to me and Mrs. Hartzler, strong support for risk 
reduction in our defense industrial base.
  To this point, this bill also includes my Buy American provision, 
which brings back jobs to the U.S. and can ensure that we get what we 
need when we need it, securing our fragile supply chain.
  I do want to take a moment in closing to thank the subcommittee 
staff, those who serve on this committee, certainly, led by Bill Sutey, 
Heath Bope, Carla Zeppieri, Liz Griffin, and Kelly Repair, and the last 
day of our clerk, Caroline, who has done a wonderful job; and to my 
personal staff, Katie Lee, Chris Macleish, and Mark Moses.
  This is a bill that America can support and, certainly, we are 
encouraging all our Members to support this NDAA for fiscal year `22.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Kelly), the ranking member of the 
Intelligence and Special Operations Subcommittee.
  Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, today I rise in strong 
support of the FY22 NDAA. Our military has and is facing unprecedented 
challenges, and this body is duty-bound to ensure

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4803">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4803">H4803</a></a>]]

our military is adequately funded and has the tools to win. We also do 
this by empowering American companies and the industrial base that 
provides goods and services to the DOD.
  The hardworking Mississippians who work for companies like Airbus, 
Huntington Ingalls, Winchester, General Dynamics, Stark Aerospace, 
SpaceX and General Atomics keep our Nation safe and deserve the support 
of our Congress.
  This bill includes a Republican amendment boosting the defense top 
line by nearly $25 billion and reverses the administration&#x27;s reckless 
cuts to our national security, restoring funding for shipbuilding, 
procurement, missile defense, and modernization.

  This bill will also fund the unfunded top priorities of our military 
that the White House failed to support. Once passed, this bill further 
bolsters our military&#x27;s ability to maintain its dominance in every 
domain, and ensures military leaders have the resources to take care of 
servicemembers and military families.
  Additionally, this year&#x27;s NDAA will begin the process of holding the 
White House accountable for the mistakes in Afghanistan. For months, we 
have asked for more detail on the so-called over-the-horizon strategy 
to conduct counterterrorism. We received scant details ahead of the 
withdrawal, and America deserves answers to why the withdrawal was so 
unorganized in planning and execution run by the Commander in Chief and 
the State Department.
  The lack of planning leading up to the withdrawal and the continued 
inability to maintain control on the ground by this administration is 
staggering. The Armed Services Committee, particularly this 
Subcommittee on Intelligence and Special Operations, will not allow 
these weaknesses of the administration to continue to place our 
citizens, allies, partners, and overall national security at risk.
  This year&#x27;s bill calls for the administration to provide a plan to 
get the rest of the American citizens out.
  Finally, I would be remiss without asking about my teammates, which 
is Tony Starks, Colin Hawkins, and Rodney Hall, professional staffer, 
Patrick Nevins, and my battle buddy in all of this, Ranking Member 
Gallego.
  I ask my colleagues to support this bill.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego), the chair of the Intelligence and 
Special Operations Subcommittee.
  Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 4350</a>, the 
National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2022.
  I congratulate my colleagues for fulfilling our obligation to debate 
and pass the National Defense Authorization Act. This year&#x27;s bill 
contains multiple provisions to address strategic challenges presented 
by China, to confront our adversaries in the gray zone of conflict, and 
to strengthen the relationships with key allies and partners.
  As chair of the Intelligence and Special Operations Subcommittee, I 
am proud of the provisions in this bill that represent critical reforms 
to the defense intelligence enterprise, special operations forces, our 
ability to counter weapons of mass destruction.

                              {time}  2145

  Our bill creates more agility across the defense intelligence 
enterprise by breaking down barriers to information sharing to enhance 
warfighters and combatant commanders in their ability to counter China 
and Russia in the information environment and focusing on expanding 
access to partners such as India and our steadfast Nordic partners such 
as Finland.
  The bill further supports rigorous oversight of our security posture 
in Afghanistan and includes provisions to better understand the 
Department&#x27;s plans to address the threat environment while postured in 
an over-the-horizon capacity. Importantly, the bill also contains $500 
million in relocation support for Afghan SIV holders.
  Finally, our bill authorizes an increase of $105 million to the 
Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, which will enhance our efforts to 
detect and fight emergent chemical and biological threats and develop 
medical countermeasures such as vaccines and therapeutics.
  Most importantly, I want to thank subcommittee Ranking Member Trent 
Kelly for his contribution to this bill and his bipartisanship, which 
helped create the foundations of such a strong bill during a 
particularly challenging year. I would also like to thank the staff--
Shannon Green, Jessica Carroll, Zachary Taylor, and Patrick Nevins--for 
their tireless efforts to get it across the finish line.
  Colleagues, in addition to meeting the most pressing security 
challenges we face as a Nation today, this bill supports our 
servicemembers with a 2.7 percent pay raise, increases parental leave 
for military families, improves women&#x27;s healthcare, and combats 
extremism in the military.
  Madam Speaker, this is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to 
support it.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher), the ranking member of the 
Military Personnel Subcommittee.
  Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I stand before you today in proud 
support of this bipartisan bill, which is a reflection of the hard work 
of both sides that went into this. This process remains some of the 
most gratifying work that we do in Congress and a testament to the way 
in which this institution can work when we put our mind to it.
  The FY22 NDAA includes a top-line budget that restores funding for 
shipbuilding, procurement, missile defense, and a number of other 
priorities that will help ensure the national defense of our great 
Nation.
  The bill that was voted out of committee continues to support and 
improve the lives of those who sacrifice for our country on a daily 
basis by authorizing a military basic pay raise of 2.7 percent.
  This bill reinforces the committee&#x27;s longstanding commitment to the 
military family by requiring the Department of Defense to increase 
parental leave, expands the in-home childcare pilot program, and 
improves support available to military families with special needs 
children.
  This bill also addresses the threat of COVID-19 by prohibiting the 
use of DOD funds to conduct research, including biomedical, infectious 
disease, and genomic research in China or with any entity controlled by 
the Chinese Communist Party. It requires DOD to report to Congress on 
the number of military personnel infected with coronavirus at the 2019 
Military World Games in Wuhan, China, and requires DOD and the Director 
of National Intelligence to assess the involvement of the Chinese 
Communist Party in the origins of COVID-19.
  I thank the chairman and ranking member for an outstanding bipartisan 
bill. I thank them both for their work on it, and I am proud to be a 
member of this committee.
  Let&#x27;s do our duty. Let&#x27;s support servicemembers, military families, 
and retirees. Let&#x27;s pass this bill.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, at this time, I have no 
further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks), the ranking member of the 
Subcommittee on Cyber, Innovative Technologies, and Information 
Systems.
  Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 4350</a>, the 
FY22 NDAA.
  Our current and future warfighting capabilities are contingent on 
modernizing the Department of Defense and recruiting and equipping the 
military with the most effective, secure, and cutting-edge 
technologies.
  Our adversaries are focused on our defeat on and off the battlefield. 
They are pouring money into research and development of emerging 
technologies, recruiting top scientists, and stealing intellectual 
property to gain a tactical edge.
  This NDAA pushes the Department to accelerate innovation and 
strengthen its cyber posture, a critical capability if we want to 
maintain superiority in the era of great power competition.
  I want to thank Ranking Member Rogers, who, because of his 
leadership, fought for and gained nearly $25 billion in this bill to 
boost emerging technologies and cybersecurity programs during the 
markup.

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4804">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4804">H4804</a></a>]]

  These funds enhance areas like hypersonics, AI, and quantum computing 
and make a historical investment to renovate the Department&#x27;s labs and 
testing facilities.
  As ranking member, I am also proud of the work that we have done on 
our subcommittee, the Cyber, Innovative Technologies, and Information 
Systems Subcommittee led by Chairman Langevin, in this inaugural NDAA 
for this subcommittee.
  We included provisions to transition innovative technologies quickly 
into the hands of the warfighter, to help companies bridge the valley 
of death, and to implement many of the recommendations of the National 
Security Commission on AI.
  In the past year, we have seen landmark cyberattacks, a trend which 
is likely to continue, and we must be prepared. We bolster and 
strengthen the Department&#x27;s information security systems and improve 
sharing and analysis of cyber threat information across the Department.

  Madam Speaker, I strongly support this bill and encourage my 
colleagues to do the same.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon), a great member of the Armed 
Services Committee.
  Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the National Defense 
Authorization Act. I commend the outstanding leadership of Chairman 
Smith and Ranking Member   Mike Rogers for delivering strong, 
bipartisan legislation that provides for our common defense.
  While I am personally grateful that this bill includes dozens of my 
provisions, I am most proud of the fact that the bill sends a clear 
bipartisan message that we must keep our national defense spending 
level with inflation and reject the temptation to cut defense when our 
allies and enemies are questioning American leadership. As the White 
House&#x27;s own strategic guidance states, America must confront global 
challenges from a position of strength, not weakness.
  I am also proud that this bill includes multiple provisions ensuring 
oversight and accountability for the recent debacle in Afghanistan. As 
we stand here today, this crisis is ongoing, with hundreds of U.S. 
citizens and residents, including my constituents from Nebraska, who 
are still trapped in Afghanistan. Oversight of the way the botched 
withdrawal was handled is not and should not be a partisan issue, and I 
am proud that the House has not backed away from its responsibilities.
  Madam Speaker, I urge support of this bill.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. Moore), one of our outstanding freshman 
Members.
  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the MILCON 
amendment.
  This is actually something that we agree on, that most people would 
agree on. We have apartments that our airmen are staying in at Hill Air 
Force Base where literally they have to section off corners of the 
sidewalk because bricks are falling off the building.
  This is not up to the standard of what we would like to provide for 
our men and women who are willing to go and serve in this capacity. 
This is something that we all agree on.
  The reason I stand to oppose the amendment is because it just 
increases the costs for a MILCON budget that is already laden with a 
lot of work with very little money. This will require a sort of 
preference for local hiring, which is a good thing, but it also adds in 
a lot of bureaucracy with respect to licensing and making sure that 
every single military construction contractor has all the little 
prerequisites for each State. This is something that we have rejected 
in the past, and it ultimately just adds a lot of cost.
  It is ironic that both the Trump and Biden administrations disagree 
with this. Chambers of commerce actually oppose this. A few others that 
are noteworthy are the defense industry of America, Association of 
General Contractors, and American Council of Engineering Companies. 
They all oppose this effort.
  Again, this impacts the skilled workforce. Every single construction 
company that I talk to right now says they can&#x27;t even hire in their 
local area. So to require companies to go to each area where there is a 
base and take away some of their skilled workforce to then go hire a 
workforce that is in that particular city, it adds an extra burden.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. Bice), an outstanding member of our 
Armed Services Committee.
  Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 
4350</a>, this year&#x27;s National Defense Authorization Act. As a member of 
the Armed Services Committee, I was honored to have a seat at the table 
in crafting this legislation, and I am pleased to have been successful 
in having a good number of my priorities for Oklahoma&#x27;s Fifth District 
included in this bill.
  As a new member of the House Armed Services Committee, I was deeply 
concerned when President Biden proposed earlier this year to 
essentially cut our defense budget below the rate of inflation at a 
time when we are facing serious threats from around the world.
  I am thankful for the leadership of Ranking Member Rogers in securing 
a bipartisan deal in this bill to provide the additional resources 
needed to meet our Nation&#x27;s defense needs. This bill makes important 
investments to protect our Nation from dangerous adversaries like 
Russia and China.
  I also fought to include several items in the bill we are considering 
today, including a measure I co-led with Congresswoman Gonzalez-Colon 
to require DOD to survey access to mental health and suicide prevention 
services within the military healthcare system, as well as a modified 
version of my bill to protect servicemembers and their families with 
disabilities from being charged out-of-pocket expenses for needed ADA 
upgrades to their on-base housing unit.
  Lastly, I successfully advanced amendments to require the DOD to 
analyze the security threats resulting from the Taliban&#x27;s release of 
thousands of prisoners from Bagram Air Base and an amendment to 
increase resources for the Army National Guard to assist CBP with 
security operations on the southern border in light of the growing 
threats emanating from Afghanistan and elsewhere.
  Bottom line, this bill strengthens our Nation&#x27;s defenses, supports 
our brave servicemembers, and sustains important defense programs 
across the Nation and in my home State of Oklahoma.
  Madam Speaker, certainly there may be provisions of this bill that 
not everyone agrees with, but I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.

  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DesJarlais), another fine member of the 
Armed Services Committee.
  Mr. DesJARLAIS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support for 
the National Defense Authorization Act. The bill before us today 
represents a much-improved effort over the Biden-Harris 
administration&#x27;s proposed budget.
  There is no more important job than providing for the defense of our 
Nation. The specter of threats from an aggressive China, a revitalized 
Russia, and radical Islamic terrorist states demand that we maintain a 
strong national defense readiness and posture.
  This NDAA will give a much-deserved and needed pay raise and expanded 
benefits to members of our armed services. We are making investments to 
ensure our military is the best equipped and trained in the world, with 
a focus on American jobs and our domestic manufacturing base.
  We are also investing in important new technologies like quantum 
computing, hypersonic weapons, and autonomous systems.
  I am proud to say that Arnold Air Force Base, the University of 
Tennessee Space Institute, Vanderbilt University, Fort Campbell Army 
Base, Oak

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4805">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4805">H4805</a></a>]]

Ridge National Laboratory, and other Tennessee stakeholders will 
receive the funds that they need to carry out vital operations for our 
United States military.
  That said, the bill is not perfect. I am disappointed in House 
Democrats for preventing my ``no first use&#x27;&#x27; amendment from coming to 
the floor for a vote. In hearings before our committee, our military 
leadership emphasized that a ``no first use&#x27;&#x27; policy is a limiting 
strategic mistake, and a number of our allies have expressed these 
concerns directly to me as well. We should never tip our strategic 
plans to our adversaries.
  It is also disappointing that those on the other side of the aisle 
have taken a bill intended to improve our military and muddled it with 
attempts to score political points.

                              {time}  2200

  While I don&#x27;t support these poison pills, I am hopeful that my 
colleagues will remove them during conference before its final passage.
  That said, we must move forward with this legislation. I support 
making it stronger, avoiding nongermane political issues, and getting 
it signed into law for our brave men and women in uniform.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz), another fine member of the Armed 
Services Committee.
  Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, on behalf of the tens of thousands of 
military families in northwest Florida, I rise in strong support of 
this year&#x27;s National Defense Authorization Act.
  This bill does right by military families by ensuring that we upgrade 
training systems, increasing their proficiency, and ensuring that our 
servicemembers are safe when they go down range.
  The bill enhances platforms and equipment survivability to ensure 
that our troops are in the best possible position to prevail in every 
battle and vanquish any foe.
  The 2.7 percent pay raise is vastly needed and is a small debt of 
gratitude for the elite level of patriotism that our servicemembers 
show each and every day.
  The bill does right by the mission by investing in research, 
development test and evaluation by increasing our investment in cyber, 
by ensuring that we have a military construction budget that allows us 
to meet ambitious goals to be able to grow strategic mission in 
particular areas, and our investment in the space force ensures that 
America will always hold the high ground.
  With this legislation, America wins the future by focusing on great 
power competition, and by ensuring that we win that great power 
competition with great focus and great competence.
  I thank the bipartisan leadership of the committee, and I would note 
that that bipartisan leadership has been necessary because President 
Biden&#x27;s initial budget did not meet the needs of the country to the 
same degree that this House will. It is a testament to Chairman Smith 
and Ranking Member Rogers that brighter minds have prevailed.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, as I have made clear, I feel 
very strongly that this is a really strong, bipartisan bill. I urge all 
Members of the House to support it.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time.
  I just want to agree with Mr. Rogers. This bill, as you can hear from 
the Members speaking in favor of it on both sides of the aisle, 
encompasses a lot of different provisions, all designed to make sure we 
can adequately defend the country; and, most importantly, designed to 
make sure that we protect the men and women who are serving us to 
protect that country.
  There are a lot of provisions in this bill focused on improving the 
quality of life, including a 2.7 percent pay increase and significant 
increases to improve things like childcare centers and barracks across 
the country.
  I think this bill does an excellent job of identifying the threats 
that we face and putting ourselves in the best possible position to 
meet those threats going forward.
  Again, no bill is perfect. We disagree on things. Everyone will have 
something in here that they wish were slightly different, but overall, 
I think we can support this bill.
  I do want to close by once again emphasizing, I know there is a lot 
of angst about the amendments that have been ruled in order; but, 
again, that is not unusual that we would deal with issues that are not 
necessarily directly within our jurisdiction. We work with the 
committees of jurisdiction in order to carry those bills. We will 
continue to work on that.
  I can say with confidence that there is no amendment that has been 
ruled in order that we are going to debate on that should impact any 
Members voting for this bill. This is a very strong bill. Do not forget 
the underlying provisions in this bill that are so important to the men 
and women who are serving this country, to the protections they need, 
the protections they deserve, and the protections that it is our 
obligation to provide for them and which I feel very, very strongly 
that this bill does.
  This bill deserves support from this committee. I urge a ``yes&#x27;&#x27; 
vote.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.

       (1) the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Public Law

     ``marihuana&#x27;&#x27; under the Controlled Substances Act;
       (2) despite the legalization of hemp, some hemp businesses 
     (including producers, manufacturers, and retailers) continue 
     to have difficulty gaining access to banking products and 
     services; and
       (3) businesses involved in the sale of hemp-derived CBD 
     products are particularly affected, due to confusion about 
     the legal status of such products.

     being violated by the customer or group of customers, if any.

       (A) Notice prohibited in cases of national security.--If an 
     appropriate Federal banking agency requests or orders a

     security, or are otherwise described under subsection (a)(2),

     Federal banking agency may inform the customer or customers 
     of the justification for the customer&#x27;s account termination.

     Federal banking agency determines that the notice required 
     under paragraph (1) may interfere with an authorized criminal 
     investigation, neither the depository institution nor the 
     appropriate Federal banking agency may inform the specific 
     customer or group of customers of the justification for the 
     customer&#x27;s account termination.
       (d) Reporting Requirement.--Each appropriate Federal 
     banking agency shall issue an annual report to the Congress 
     stating--
       (1) the aggregate number of specific customer accounts that 
     the agency requested or ordered a depository institution to 
     terminate during the previous year; and
       (2) the legal authority on which the agency relied in

     SEC. 5415. DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS FUNDS.

       Section 7(a)(3)(A) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 
     289(a)(3)(A)) is amended by reducing the dollar figure by 
     $6,000,000.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.
  Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes.
  Madam Speaker, I offer this amendment, which is identical to the SAFE 
Banking Act the House passed by a vote of 321-101 in April. 180 
bipartisan Members of Congress and 39 bipartisan Senators are 
cosponsors of this important legislation to allow State-regulated 
cannabis businesses to access the financial system and improve safety 
in our communities by getting cash off the streets.
  By bringing cash into the financial system, banks and credit unions 
will

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4809">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4809">H4809</a></a>]]

subject the funds and the account holders to rigorous anti-money 
laundering and ``know your customer&#x27;&#x27; requirements. Under FinCEN&#x27;s 2014 
guidance, financial institutions must comply with a heightened anti-
money laundering reporting regime when providing services to cannabis 
businesses. This will strengthen the security of our financial system 
and our country by keeping bad actors like foreign cartels out of the 
cannabis industry.
  But most importantly, this amendment will reduce the risk of violent 
crime in our communities. By dealing in all cash, these businesses and 
their employees become targets for robbery, assaults, burglaries, and 
more. In Colorado, Travis Mason, a young father and Marine Corps 
veteran, was murdered while working as a security guard for a cannabis 
business. We cannot wait any longer to address this public safety 
threat.
  I want to thank my cosponsors on this amendment, Representatives 
Velazquez, Davidson, Correa, Blumenauer, Joyce, and Barbara Lee, as 
well as former Representatives Heck and Stivers.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, this is a fine piece of 
legislation in a stand-alone fashion. In fact, I voted for the 
gentleman&#x27;s stand-alone bill. I think what he is trying to accomplish 
is admirable and should be accomplished, but not in the National 
Defense Authorization Act.
  He knows that I am not picking on his bill. I feel this way about 
anything that is not in our jurisdiction.
  But having said that, the language is not related to the NDAA, and I 
urge opposition.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I just would remind the gentleman from 
Alabama the matter was deemed germane by the Parliamentarian.
  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson).
  Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I think the reason it was ruled germane 
by the Parliamentarian is the cartels control the drug trade in the 
United States. While most States have made some legal form for 
marijuana, the cartels still dominate the market.
  Part of the reason is the cash is in the black market. Legal 
operations in many states cannot be banked. People that work there 
can&#x27;t get mortgages. They don&#x27;t have access to the banking system. The 
reality is the financial industry is being pushed by regulators to kind 
of back-door and make something illegal.
  This has been done on any number of fronts, whether firearms are 
disfavored in some states, well, you know, you have reputational risk 
if you are going to bank these people. For too long in America we have 
had a standard that said, ``Well, you are not going to bank these 
people, are you?&#x27;&#x27; Who ``these people&#x27;&#x27; are has changed.
  This is preventing us from stopping the cartels. It is germane, and I 
urge everyone to support the amendment.
  Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 
Governors from 21 States and Territories endorsing the SAFE Banking 
Act, along with a list of 41 other diverse organizations who support 
the legislation.

                                                   April 19, 2021.
       Dear Congressional Leaders: As our States&#x27; chief 
     executives, we urge Congress to pass legislation allowing 
     states with legalized medical or adult-use cannabis to 
     operate safely under the national banking system. We strongly 
     support the passage of the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) 
     Banking Act of 2021 (<a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1996">H.R. 1996</a>/S. 910) or similar legislation 
     that would remove the legal uncertainty and allow banks and 
     credit unions to provide services to state-licensed cannabis-
     related businesses.
       We were pleased that the House passed similar legislation 
     in the 116th Congress (<a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1595">H.R. 1595</a>). The SAFE Banking Act of 
     2021 already has more than 165 bipartisan House cosponsors 
     and more than 30 bipartisan Senate cosponsors. The 
     legislation has also received support from more than 30 
     associations.
       Currently, 36 U.S. states, four U.S. territories, and the 
     District of Columbia have legalized the medical use of 
     cannabis. Additionally, 18 states, two territories, and the 
     District of Columbia have legalized recreational use by 
     adults over 21 years of age. Despite legalization of cannabis 
     at the state-level, our financial institutions face enormous 
     legal risks and criminal and civil liability under the 
     Controlled Substances Act. These barriers disincentive 
     financial institutions from providing banking services to 
     state-licensed and regulated cannabis businesses.
       Because few banks and credit unions provide these services, 
     state-licensed cannabis businesses predominantly operate on a 
     cash basis. Without banking services, state-licensed cannabis 
     businesses are unable to write checks, make and receive 
     electronic payments, utilize a payroll provider, or accept 
     credit and debit cards. Cash only businesses pose a 
     significant public safety risk to customers and employees. 
     The cash-only environment also burdens state and local 
     government agencies that must collect tax and fee payments in 
     person and in cash, which creates additional public expenses 
     and employee safety risks.
       State and federal governments have a shared interest in 
     upholding the rule of law, protecting public safety, and 
     transitioning markets out of the shadows and into our 
     transparent and regulated banking system. Many of our states 
     have implemented laws and regulations to reduce these risks 
     while ensuring financial accountability of the cannabis 
     industry. These public safety risks can be further mitigated 
     on the federal level by passing the SAFE Banking Act to 
     provide state-licensed cannabis businesses with access to 
     banking service providers.
       We urge you to pass the SAFE Banking Act of 2021 or similar 
     legislation that would provide a safe harbor for depository 
     institutions that provide a financial product or service to a 
     state-licensed cannabis business in states that have 
     legalized cannabis. We look forward to working with you as 
     legislation progresses to address this urgent public policy 
     and safety concern.
           Sincerely,
         Governor Jared Polis, State of Colorado; Governor Ned 
           Lamont, State of Connecticut; Governor John Bel 
           Edwards, State of Louisiana; Governor Charlie Baker, 
           State of Massachusetts; Governor Steve Sisolak, State 
           of Nevada; Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, State of 
           New Mexico; Governor Doug Burgum, State of North 
           Dakota; Governor Gavin Newsom, State of California;

           Mills, State of Maine; Governor Gretchen Whitmer, State 
           of Michigan; Governor Phil Murphy, State of New Jersey;

gentleman from California (Mr. Correa).
  Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the SAFE 
Banking Act as an amendment to the NDAA. More than half--let me repeat, 
more than half of the U.S. population lives in a State jurisdiction 
where cannabis is legal. Veterans prefer cannabis to opioids to treat 
their invisible wounds that they bring back from the battlefield.
  Cannabis customers and businesses are law-abiding citizens and 
entities, yet they have to pay their employees, their bills, and their 
Federal taxes with cash. It just does not make sense.
  As my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have pointed out, we 
need to get rid of that gray black market, bring this cash business 
into the banking system.
  Again, I rise in strong support of this commonsense measure.
  Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time 
to close.
  This is a public safety and a national security matter, very germane 
to the issues at hand, dealing with foreign cartels and particularly 
the cash that is developed by this business that leads to crime. We 
have seen murders, robberies, assaults, and then the potential for 
foreign malignant forces to get into the cannabis industry here in the 
United States.
  I urge the passage of amendment No. 1 and yield back the balance of 
my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the

     this Act.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania.
  Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment, 
which would require private student lenders to discharge private 
student loan debt for people who become totally or permanently 
disabled.
  This amendment was inspired by a constituent who came to our office 
in need. Like many young Americans, my constituent pursued an education 
and chose to use private loans to help fund her college costs. She was 
also fully prepared to repay her loans, but tragically she became 
permanently and totally disabled.
  Because of her permanent disability, her mother must now take care of 
her for life, and not only is the mother her caretaker, she is also the 
cosigner obligated to carry and pay for this debilitating debt.

                              {time}  2215

  Though the student&#x27;s particular lender allowed her debt to be 
discharged, her mother, who cosigned the loan, was not dismissed from 
that responsibility. Though this reality may be foreign to many of us, 
for those it does affect, it will change their lives forever.
  That is why this amendment would right a wrong and bring parity 
between protections for private student loan borrowers and Federal 
student loan borrowers.
  Currently, private student lenders are not required to discharge the 
obligation of a borrower who becomes permanently disabled, only in the 
case of death. However, for Federal student loans in the case of 
permanent disability or death, loans are discharged.
  In addition, Federal student loans do not require cosigners.
  Specifically, my amendment amends the Truth in Lending Act to require 
discharge of private student loans in the case of permanent or total 
disability of the borrower; require the discharge of cosigners in the 
case of the borrower&#x27;s permanent or total disability; require private 
lenders to discharge a borrower&#x27;s obligation when they are notified 
that the Federal Government has discharged the Federal student loans of 
the borrower.
  As we debate the National Defense Authorization Act, it is important 
to highlight that our servicemembers are disproportionately using 
private student loans. And these veterans who use private student loans 
disproportionately use them to attend for-profit universities or 
institutions. In some instances, veterans leave with nearly double the 
amount of debt compared to

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4811">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4811">H4811</a></a>]]

their counterparts who use Federal veterans&#x27; education benefits.
  Our veterans, our servicemembers, along with all of our constituents, 
deserve to be protected in the case of unexpected hardship.
  I am pleased that in August, the Biden administration announced it 
would automatically cancel Federal student loan debt through the Total 
and Permanent Disability Discharge program. The TPD Discharge program 
provides loan discharge for the borrower and the cosigner should the 
borrower become totally and permanently disabled.
  This is a first step in providing 323,000 Federal student loan 
borrowers with disabilities the relief they are entitled to under the 
law.
  It is our responsibility to codify and extend this same needed 
support to our private student loan borrowers and their families 
affected with these tragedies.
  I pray no one go through what my constituents have gone through.
  We must move this commonsense and important amendment forward, and I 
urge all members to support it.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Stansbury). The gentleman from Ohio is 
recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, this amendment requires the discharge of 
private education loans in the event the borrower dies or becomes 
permanently and totally disabled. Republicans are very sympathetic to 
both situations.
  Private education lenders already provide relief to the estates of 
deceased student borrowers and the student loan borrowers who become 
permanently and totally disabled, if requested.
  Furthermore, in a competitive market, student loan seekers are free 
to choose between lenders who observe similar practices and those who 
do not.
  Congress should not attempt to legislate the terms of agreement to 
which the parties have already agreed.
  This amendment imposes a new condition on private education lenders 
in contracts that haven&#x27;t been negotiated or discussed between the 
lender and borrower.
  If this amendment becomes law, this clause would be automatic, 
increasing compliance costs for lenders, diminishing the market value 
of existing loans, and having the downstream effect of making credit 
more expensive for consumers.
  Therefore, I believe this amendment is a solution in search of a 
problem. It would insert Congress into a process that is already being 
utilized by lenders.
  And while I understand the gentlewoman&#x27;s concerns that led to 
drafting this amendment, I cannot support it in its current form. In 
fact, I would personally be happy to work with the gentlewoman to solve 
the problem in a different way.
  I do oppose this amendment in its current form, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for wanting to work 
with me on this. Certainly this is a serious problem, and it is a 
serious problem for my constituent, and I am sure constituents in any 
other district in our country.
  But there is a misstatement in the gentleman&#x27;s words. It is voluntary 
right now on the part of the private lenders, and this bill would 
codify the requirement to ensure that disability discharge for private 
student loans is not a choice.
  Certainly, when you sign up for a loan, you don&#x27;t think about 
planning for becoming totally disabled and unable to afford your own 
student loans.
  Unfortunately, as my constituent case shows, some private lenders do 
not voluntarily discharge for the borrower and the cosponsor in the 
case of permanent and total disability. I believe we have a duty to 
stand up for the most vulnerable among us. This bill would help 
accomplish that goal.
  I commend the lenders who do step up voluntarily, but we need to 
codify this discharge of liability in the case of total or permanent 
disability.
  I urge support, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).
  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Ohio for yielding.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania.
  This amendment would require private lenders automatically to 
discharge loans for borrowers who die or become totally and permanently 
disabled.

  As you can clearly see, this amendment, like so many others we are 
debating, has no relation to our Nation&#x27;s defense.
  In addition to being irrelevant to the bill we are considering, the 
language is also completely unnecessary.
  Private lenders, as my colleague has already said, already discharge 
loans for borrowers and their families who find themselves in these 
horrible circumstances.
  They do this not because they are required by the government to do 
so, but because it is the right thing to do.
  All this amendment would do is waste valuable time to create a 
government mandate for a feature already commonplace in the industry.
  This amendment is yet another example of Democrats finding ways for 
the Federal Government to take over every aspect of our lives and 
destroy as much as possible of the private sector.
  I urge my colleagues to object to the inclusion of this unneeded 
policy.
  Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, of course there is a clear nexus to our 
veterans and our servicemembers, and it would be marvelous if all 
private student loan lenders would voluntarily discharge in the case of 
permanent or total disability. It just simply isn&#x27;t the case.
  We are trying to ensure parity, regardless of who the borrower owes. 
We don&#x27;t believe this would be a difficulty for all of these lenders 
who you say are willing to do this.
  If the lenders honestly want to fight this so that they can take 
every last dollar of the individuals and their families despite their 
suffering, they can go to court, and they can ask the court for a 
remedy.
  I urge support, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I would just reiterate that private 
student lenders already work with borrowers for these unplanned 
situations clearly in death and in disabilities alike.
  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).
  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from

     providing the waiver under this paragraph to nationals of any 
     country, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation

     States, unlawfully obtaining entry to other parts of the 
     United States, or seeking withholding of removal or asylum,

     discretion suspend the Guam and Northern Mariana Islands visa 
     waiver program, or the Virgin Islands visa waiver program, at 
     any time, on a country-by-country basis, for other good 
     cause.

     may request the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary 
     of Homeland Security to add a particular country to the list 
     of countries whose nationals may obtain the waiver provided 
     by this subsection, and the Secretary of Homeland Security 
     may grant such request after consultation with the Secretary 
     of the Interior and the Secretary of State, and may 
     promulgate regulations with respect to the inclusion of that 
     country and any special requirements the Secretary of 
     Homeland Security, in the Secretary&#x27;s sole discretion, may 
     impose prior to allowing nationals of that country to obtain 
     the waiver provided by this subsection.&#x27;&#x27;.
       (b) Regulations Deadline.--Not later than one year after 
     the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland 
     Security, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior 
     and the Secretary of State, shall promulgate any necessary 
     regulations as described in subsection (a) required to 
     implement the waiver provided in such subsection for the 
     Virgin Islands.
       (c) Waiver Countries.--The regulations described in 
     subsection (b) shall include a listing of all member or 
     associate member countries of the Caribbean Community 
     (CARICOM) whose nationals may obtain, on a country-by-country 
     basis, the waiver provided by this section, except that such 
     regulations shall not provide for a listing of any country if 
     the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that such 
     country&#x27;s inclusion on such list would represent a threat to 
     the welfare, safety, or security of the United States or its 
     territories and commonwealths.
       (d) Conforming Amendments.--
       (1) Documentation requirements.--Section 212(a)(7)(B)(iii)

     authorizing waiver of clause (i) in the case of visitors to 
     Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or 
     the Virgin Islands of the United States, see subsection 
     (l).&#x27;&#x27;.
       (2) Admission of nonimmigrants.--Section 214(a)(1) of such

     Islands in accordance with section 212(l) of the Immigration 
     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(l)), as amended by this 
     Act. Such fee shall be set at a level that will ensure 
     recovery of the full costs of such processing, any additional 
     costs associated with the administration of the fees 
     collected, and any sums necessary to offset reduced 
     collections of the nonimmigrant visa fee or the electronic 
     travel authorization fee that otherwise would have been 
     collected from such individuals.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentlewoman from Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett) and a Member opposed 
each will control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands.
  Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this amendment, and 
I yield myself 3 minutes.
  Madam Speaker, I first want to give a little bit of a history lesson 
and some information to my colleagues here.
  The Virgin Islands and the territories, many of whom are outside of 
the customs zone, when one comes to the U.S. Virgin Islands in order to 
get to the mainland, you must go through Customs and Border Protection 
presenting passport, et cetera, as you would in a foreign country.
  My amendment responds to the need for an expedited nonimmigrant 
visitor visa program in the U.S. Virgin Islands that is now currently 
available to other U.S. territories outside of the U.S. customs zone in 
the Pacific, which would aid the Virgin Islands in allowing more 
visitors. Specifically, the Virgin Islands is seeking authority to 
extend the special nonimmigrant visitor visa waiver program that is 
currently available in Guam and Northern Marianas.
  Adding the Virgin Islands to this existing nonimmigrant visitor visa 
waiver program would allow the Department of Homeland Security to 
consider approving visa-less entry into the Virgin Islands up to and 
limited to 45 days primarily for residents of neighboring Caribbean 
countries. This would better enable the Virgin Islands to compete 
economically with other islands and nations in the Caribbean.
  It would apply solely to the Virgin Islands, and because we are 
outside of the customs zone by law, like other U.S. territories, it 
would not allow visa-less entry into any other part of the United 
States.
  It would allow individuals from other Caribbean islands to come into 
the Virgin Islands on an expedited visa process, which would lead to 
increased tourism, greater opportunities to host international events, 
and support our small business and medical facilities.
  For example, the Virgin Islands annually hosts numerous yacht shows 
and regattas, which could yield additional economic support, except for 
the fact that we have a longer entry for our neighbors to come into the 
territories.
  Similarly, our young people cannot compete with our neighboring 
islands which are much closer to us than the United States. The U.S. 
Virgin Islands is over 1,000 miles to Florida, as opposed to the 
Bahamas, which is only 180 miles to Miami. Cuba is only 300 miles to 
Miami. We are way down the Antilles chain.
  This amendment would remain reasonably limited in scope to the 
Caribbean community and other countries approved by the Department of 
Homeland Security.
  The provision also allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to 
suspend waivers to any individual or countries if they pose a risk to 
law enforcement or security interests of the

United States or at the secretary&#x27;s own discretion.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

  Madam Speaker, extending visa waiver privileges in the U.S. Virgin 
Islands for Caribbean countries will present yet another challenge for 
immigration enforcement and drug interdiction efforts.
  The Department of Homeland Security has historically noted that a 
special visa waiver program for the U.S. Virgin Islands would result in 
a significant increase in overstays and make it easier for previously 
removed aliens to re-enter U.S. territory. This amendment would also 
hamper our efforts to stop the import of illegal drugs.
  According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, cocaine is the 
principal drug threat in the Caribbean with the U.S. Virgin Islands 
already serving as a major transshipment point between cocaine-
producing countries in South America and the continental United States.

  A special visa waiver program for the U.S. Virgin Islands would also 
open the door to birth tourism, something we have already seen in the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. territory in the 
Pacific.
  In 2017, The Wall Street Journal noted that ``Saipan has become known 
as the latest hot spot for birth tourism, a place where women can give 
birth to babies who will automatically acquire U.S. citizenship.&#x27;&#x27; The 
problem has become so widespread that, in recent years, more children 
have been born to Chinese tourists on the islands than Americans.
  Chinese syndicates have also taken advantage of the CNMI program to 
engage in human trafficking and forced labor. By any measure, the CNMI 
Visa Waiver Program has been an unmitigated disaster. We should be 
getting rid of these programs, not expanding them.
  Madam Speaker, America&#x27;s immigration laws and visa restrictions 
should apply uniformly across the country. We should not be creating 
special loopholes or allowing States and territories to operate their 
own independent immigration systems. At a time when the United States 
is seeing record illegal immigration and record asylum claims, creating 
this visa program is a bad idea at the worst possible time.
  I have to say, I am stunned that the majority would bring this forth 
at this time when we have a deluge that is happening at the southern 
border. Now to create another loophole just like in the Pacific, only 
this time in the Atlantic, it is not appropriate to be doing this at 
this time.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Speaker, I find it very interesting the concern that my 
colleague has for the U.S. Virgin Islands when we don&#x27;t get the 
economic support from that side of the aisle that would allow us to 
mitigate the need for opening our shores up to our Caribbean neighbors.
  As you can find out, we have received technical assistance from the 
Department of Homeland Security Office of the Chief Counsel, as well as 
the Office of Field Operations, in the process of developing this visa 
program. As I am sure my colleague is aware, under the auspices of this 
program, it does authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to 
exclude or remove a country from the visa waiver program list if the 
Secretary determines inclusion would represent a threat to the welfare, 
safety, or security of the United States or its territories and its 
commonwealth.
  I find the use of birthright tourism in Saipan, if you would look at 
the data, is only a very small percentage of the overall visitors and 
that the related costs are outweighed by the extreme tourist and 
economic benefits to the Pacific.
  I also find it interesting that he is concerned about what is 
happening on the border at this time, considering that most of the 
individuals who are coming through that border are much closer, coming 
from countries, including that of Haiti, which are much closer to 
Florida than they are to the U.S. Virgin Islands.
  The thought that individuals would take the time and the resources to 
come to an island nation where they would have to go through Customs 
and Border Protection to move into the mainland is in itself a 
discussion that negates what he is concerned with.
  Additionally, as for drugs, yes, the Virgin Islands does have a 
problem with drug transportation, which is going through the U.S. 
Postal Service. I don&#x27;t think any of these visitors would be the 
individuals being put into the mail and going through the U.S. Postal 
Service.
  Madam Speaker, I ask for adoption of this amendment. It is germane, 
and it is related and worked through from Homeland Security.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I would just respond this way: America 
offers great support to all of our friends in the Caribbean. It is not 
accurate that we don&#x27;t offer support. We do.
  The second point is that the Secretary of--I am assuming she was 
referring to Homeland Security--could exclude or change the program. 
How likely is that when we see what is happening currently? When we 
were told by this government a month ago that people coming from 
Afghanistan would have an SIV, we have found very few of them have 
that. They have just been waived in on parole.
  That is part of the reason why Congress needs to maintain its 
authority, because we cannot count on the executive branch enforcing 
the laws of this country. All we have to do is look at the news of the 
day to understand that we have open borders, and it is because the 
executive branch refuses to control our borders.
  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no&#x27;&#x27; vote on this amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.

``534. Merchant Mariner Equity Compensation Fund.&#x27;&#x27;.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green) and a Member opposed each will control 
5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.
  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, and still I rise. Tonight, I rise 
to express my gratitude to many persons who have caused us to have this 
opportunity. I thank Chairman Smith for his service and what he has 
done and Ranking Member Rogers, the members of the Committee on Rules, 
and the members of the Committee on Veterans Affairs.
  Madam Speaker, I rise to say that I do support the NDAA. I understand 
the need for a strong military, but I also rise tonight with an appeal 
for some compassion, compassion and, to a certain extent, mercy for our 
veteran merchant marines. I ask for this compassion because they didn&#x27;t 
get some of the benefits that others did.
  Let me just read the words, if I may, of President Roosevelt. On June 
22, 1944, these are his words when signing the GI Bill: ``I trust 
Congress will soon provide similar opportunities to members of the 
Merchant Marine who have risked their lives time and time again during 
war for the welfare of our country.&#x27;&#x27;
  Congress did not provide similar benefits for the merchant marines. 
As a result of Congress not doing so, most people don&#x27;t know that the 
merchant marines were denied benefits within the GI Bill, denied the 
stipend for the cost of living, books, and supplies as it relates to 
education, denied tuition-free education, denied unemployment benefits, 
denied medical benefits, denied low-cost guaranteed loans, denied 
opportunities.
  Madam Speaker, I appeal tonight for those who are still surviving, 
all of whom are in their nineties. I had the privilege of being with 
Mr. Charles Mills, 101 years young and still making the appeal for help 
for these veterans, who literally won a lawsuit to have themselves 
declared as such.
  I make the appeal for compassion for our merchant marines, who had a 
very high casualty count during World War II.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Illinois is recognized 
for 5 minutes.
  Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, the NDAA is one of the most important bills 
Congress passes annually. In fact, the past decade, the NDAA has been 
enacted every year. As such, the NDAA often becomes a grab bag for a 
variety of priorities. To protect the integrity of this process, I 
believe the NDAA should focus on strengthening the Department of 
Defense--its systems, its programs, and its personnel. This amendment 
would provide an unprecedented $25,000 one-time payment from the VA to 
World War II merchant marines. Therefore, we should not be discussing 
this proposal as part of the NDAA.
  I thank Representative Green for his advocacy on behalf of the 
merchant marines, and I support the merchant marines. I am also 
grateful for the bravery of these men who served during World War II. 
They faced danger, and some made the ultimate sacrifice in service to 
our country.
  That said, their service has been recognized. The GI Bill Improvement 
Act of 1977 provided a pathway to VA care benefits for civilian groups, 
known as active duty designees, who supported the Armed Forces in World 
War II. The merchant marines are considered active duty designees and, 
as such, received veteran status and eligibility for VA benefits 
decades ago.
  However, this amendment carves out a new benefit for merchant marines 
unlike anything Congress has authorized in the past, not even for our 
most highly decorated veterans.
  I have heard that merchant marines feel they were shortchanged 
because they did not receive the GI Bill benefits. However, this bill 
creates an inequity among other veterans and active duty designees by 
providing a thank-you payment for merchant marines.
  Ultimately, this amendment unfairly singles out one group of service 
above another. I also have questions about how many merchant marines 
would be covered under this amendment and why $25,000 was deemed as the 
appropriate amount.
  Considering this bill under regular order before the House Committee 
of Veterans&#x27; Affairs would allow us to ask those questions. It makes 
more sense to have it done that way. This is why I cannot support this 
amendment&#x27;s inclusion in the NDAA tonight.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is 
remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Illinois has 2 minutes remaining.
  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, tuition benefits in today&#x27;s 
dollars would be about $8,000. The stipend for the cost of living, 
books, and supplies would be about $1,200. The unemployment benefits--
and I am low-balling--would be about $16,000.
  The medical benefits we can&#x27;t measure. The loss of opportunities 
because of the loans that they could have received we cannot measure.
  But we can do this: We can do what General Eisenhower asked us to do. 
We can do what President Roosevelt asked us to do and President Truman 
asked us to do.
  This is our opportunity, a unique moment in time to correct an 
injustice. And I appeal to you to do so.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, as I mentioned, this amendment would provide 
an unprecedented $25,000 one-time payment for VA World War II merchant 
marines. It did not go through regular order. It did not go through the 
committee of jurisdiction. This amendment

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4815">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4815">H4815</a></a>]]

should be placed in the committee that has jurisdiction to justify so 
that if not only this group but other groups would be able and should 
be able to receive benefits, as this amendment requires, we would be 
able to do that.
  Madam Speaker, I support our merchant marines. I always have. My 20 
years in the State legislature, I did just that. As a matter of fact, 
at every veteran ceremony, I mentioned and brought up our merchant 
marines as our veterans.
  That being said, this is not the way to handle this bill. I plead 
with the Members of this body not to accept this. I am adamantly 
opposed. I would love to take it up in the committee, not in this bill 
where it is not the proper place.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                              {time}  2245

  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 1 minute 
remaining.
  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, to take this through regular order 
at this time would mean that we would call on witnesses who have long 
since gone to glory. It would mean that many of those who live today 
would not live to see the day that the justice would be served that 
they richly deserve.
  So I make an appeal on behalf of the those who have earned this 
compassion, they risked their lives for their country, and many of them 
died. This is our final opportunity for many of them, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. Green).
  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. Green).
  The amendment was agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

10 printed in part C of <a href="/congressional-report/117th-congress/house-report/125">House Report 117-125</a>.
  Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island.
  Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment, which makes clear 
that the statutory rights of servicemembers and their families under 
the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, or SCRA, cannot be waived through 
forced arbitration unless it is agreed to by the servicemember after a 
dispute arises.
  Americans who serve in our military, our veterans and their families 
sacrifice much in service to our country. Often they have fought to 
protect the fundamental idea that we are a Nation of laws and 
institutions that guarantee the rights and prosperity of every 
American.
  Since the Second World War, Congress has created many laws, including 
the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, to expand and strengthen the 
rights and protections of servicemembers and veterans. These laws are 
essential protections that guarantee every veteran and active duty 
servicemembers, including the Reserves and National Guard the right to 
be free from workplace discrimination on the basis of their military 
service, and the right to their day in court to enforce these 
provisions. We are a stronger and better Nation because of these 
rights.
  SCRA prevents landlords from enacting eviction proceedings, mortgage 
holders from foreclosing on a home, and lenders from repossessing a 
vehicle while a member of our armed services is on active duty. 
However, forced arbitration clauses embedded in mortgages and titles 
prevent accountability for bad actors taking advantage of our 
servicemembers while they are protecting our country.
  For too long, forced arbitration has eroded these fundamental 
protections by funneling servicemembers&#x27; claims into a private system 
set up by corporations. Buried deep within the fine print of everyday 
contracts, forced arbitration clauses block the brave men and women in 
uniform, as well as their family members, from having their day in 
court to hold corporations accountable for breaking the law.
  Charles Beard&#x27;s story is an example of how forced arbitration impacts 
our servicemembers. While Charles, a former sergeant in the Army 
National Guard, was on tour in Iraq, the bank repossessed his family 
car in clear violation of SCRA. It was the only vehicle his wife and 
five children could rely on.
  When they attempted to hold the bank accountable for violating his 
rights, they forced his claim into arbitration citing a clause in 
Charles&#x27; contract that he was required to sign to purchase the car, 
which waived his constitutional right to a jury trial.
  This private system does not to have the same procedural safeguards 
of our justice system. It is not subject to oversight, it does not have 
a judge or jury, and it is not bound by laws passed by Congress or the 
States. These clauses allow companies to choose the arbiter and venue 
while denying servicemembers any right to appeal.
  This is nothing short of corporate takeover or our Nation&#x27;s system of 
laws, and the American people have had enough. The overwhelming 
majority of voters, including 83 percent of Democrats and 87 percent of 
Republicans support ending forced arbitration. It is time to act.
  My bipartisan amendment would end this shameful practice by 
clarifying that arbitration clauses are only enforceable if agreed to 
by servicemembers or their family after a dispute arises, thereby 
protecting their rights under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.
  As a Nation devoted to protecting our brave men and women in uniform, 
we have to ensure that their rights are actually enforceable in court.
  Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, Guy Reschenthaler, 
Jared Golden, Anthony Brown, and Veterans Affairs Chairman Mark Takano 
for their strong, bipartisan support for this amendment to protect our 
men and women in uniform.

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4816">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4816">H4816</a></a>]]

  This provision was incorporated in both the 2020 and 2021 NDAA. Madam 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues, again, to support this amendment and 
protect American servicemembers, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany) 
is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Speaker, arbitration clauses in contracts let private parties 
agree in advance on a way to resolve further disputes and have 
significant benefits. But for years, Democrats have worked relentlessly 
to undermine arbitration and the efficiencies arbitration agreements 
often have for private parties.
  These agreements generally work well and the process itself is a fair 
and effective way to solve disagreements. Arbitration is also usually 
faster and cheaper than hiring an attorney and suiting up for drawn-out 
litigation.
  Making arbitration harder for certain claims will mean Americans 
spend more time in court with no guarantee of getting better outcomes. 
The Democrat-driven campaign to up-end the use of arbitration will 
certainly benefit the plaintiff&#x27;s bar. But it will make life worse for 
the American people.
  With that context in mind, we can consider this amendment in light of 
the larger policy debate it is connected to. This amendment rests on 
the idea that pre-dispute arbitration agreements are fundamentally 
problematic and unfair or work poorly. But that is not true.
  And this amendment cannot be considered in isolation. Instead, it is 
a policy gateway to the Democrats&#x27; longstanding priority to eliminate 
arbitration agreements entirely. This amendment should be rejected. 
Separately, it is true that we can have a debate over the merits of 
arbitration agreements now in the context of the NDAA, but we should 
not be having that debate here and now.

  If the policy in this amendment is sound, Congress should consider 
that policy as an independent bill, in the light of day, and after 
appropriate congressional oversight.
  Madam Speaker, I oppose this amendment because it is bad policy and 
because of this flawed process, and I urge my colleagues to do the 
same.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Takano), the distinguished chairman of the Veterans 
Affairs Committee.
  Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan amendment, which 
would prohibit the enforcement of forced arbitration clauses and 
contracts covered by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, or SCRA.
  Forced arbitration has undermined the rights of servicemembers for 
years by forcing them to waive their ability to seek remedies through 
the courts. This prohibition on forced arbitration clauses would 
protect countless men and women wearing the uniform of our Nation from 
predatory lenders while being deployed.
  SCRA extends important financial protections to military service 
personnel who are currently serving on active duty, and are often 
targeted for exploitation. These protections can range from prohibiting 
lenders from repossessing cars and foreclosing on homes while 
servicemembers are actively deployed. I will repeat, while they are 
actively deployed. This amendment will expand these protections to 
remove a common tool used in this exploitation.
  Those who serve in our military are inherently at a disadvantage 
against aggressive lenders as the nature of their service makes it 
difficult to seek fair resolve in any claims. While lenders are aware 
of this unique circumstance, many seek to take full advantage of these 
servicemembers. And this is a shame.
  Our servicemembers protect us both at home and abroad, and it is time 
we safeguard their rights against predatory lenders and others who 
shamelessly seek to exploit members of our military.
  So I am thankful to my colleagues for their leadership on this issue, 
Mr. Cicilline, Mr. Golden, Mr. Reschenthaler, and Mr. Brown, and I urge 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of this 
amendment, and I hope it stays in after conference.
  Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, as I stated earlier, this is a policy 
gateway that the Democrats seek to eliminate arbitration. It has been a 
longstanding goal of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to 
achieve that goal, and this opens up the door to it.
  And I think about the debates that we have in the Judiciary 
Committee, where courts are being clogged up, talking about needing 
more judges, changing the circuits, things like that. This will add to 
the clogging of our courts, and that is why we should oppose this bill.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Rhode Island has 15 
seconds remaining.
  Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, when my friend said that the 
arbitration generally works, he is right, it generally works for big, 
powerful corporations, employers, financial institutions, but it 
doesn&#x27;t work for servicemen and women who are serving our country in 
the military.
  It makes it harder, it is more difficult, it is more costly. And, by 
the way, if you want to go to arbitration, you can elect to do it, you 
just can&#x27;t be forced into it if this amendment passes. We hear our 
friends all the time say to stand up for the men and women in uniform, 
show it by voting for this amendment.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).
  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. Cicilline).
  The amendment was agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Michigan.
  Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of amendment No. 11 which 
would provide critical needed consumer protection to our servicemembers 
who hold medical debt.
  No one chooses to get sick, yet medical debt is the leading cause of 
personal bankruptcy in our country, and the pandemic has only made paid 
our medical debt crisis worse, especially for our veterans.
  According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, servicemembers 
and veterans are nearly twice as likely to submit debt collection 
complaints as the general public. And medical debt concerns comprise 
nearly 13 percent of servicemember debt collection complaints.
  So this amendment is important because medical bills and 
reimbursements are often vague and confusing. Servicemembers often 
assert that the calculation of the underlying debt is inaccurate and 
unfair. Other times, bills go missing during deployment or are 
delivered to the wrong recipient.
  So this amendment would strengthen servicemembers&#x27; consumer 
protections regarding medical debt by preventing the collection of 
medical debt for 2 years from the date of medical billing, and 
prohibiting credit agencies from reporting all medical debt collections 
for a year.

                              {time}  2300

  My amendment also requires medical debt collectors to provide 
servicemembers with their consumer rights upon contact.
  Together, these protections would provide servicemembers much-needed 
clarity to figure out what they actually owe and what the impact will 
have on their credit.
  So, Madam Speaker, debt collection particularly affects our young 
servicemembers and veterans who have little credit history upon 
enlisting.
  Among servicemembers with 3 or fewer years of service, the CFPB has 
found 5 percent had medical debts in collection just prior to 
separation from service, and that number doubles to more than 10 
percent within a year of their separation from service. As a result, 
those same individuals with 3 years or less of service, on average, 
exit the armed services with subprime credit scores.
  So with that I really finally ask my colleagues to please help us ban 
medical debt also for medically necessary procedures from ever even 
appearing on servicemembers&#x27; credit reports.
  This amendment would not prevent States from implementing stronger 
protections for our servicemembers. It would not preempt existing 
consumer protections for our servicemembers already on the books.
  Again, I remind my colleagues that, again, this is really critical 
for our servicemembers.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition, and I am 
opposed to this amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Ohio is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, this amendment delays the collection of 
servicemembers&#x27; medical debt for 2 years. It outright bans the 
reporting of a servicemembers&#x27; medically necessary procedures to a 
credit reporting agency ever, and it restricts the reporting of a 
servicemember&#x27;s debt obligations to a credit reporting agency for 1 
year.
  Republicans have supported removing paid medical debt from a 
consumer&#x27;s credit report that was unpredictable and unavoidable. 
However, this amendment would remove all information related to 
medically necessary procedures for servicemembers. Frankly, it exploits 
servicemembers to advance a cause my colleague has previously advocated 
for which is to eliminate medical reporting altogether to credit 
reporting agencies.
  Debt, including medically necessary debt, is important criteria to 
assess a borrower&#x27;s creditworthiness and ability to repay and should 
appear on credit reports of consumers, including servicemembers. It can 
improve their credit scores if they pay their debts. Removing 
predictive information from a

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4818">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4818">H4818</a></a>]]

credit report has the potential to increase the cost of credit, 
particularly for those borrowers who have limited credit history.
  Requiring the expedited removal of debt from such reports will 
undermine the safety and soundness of financial institutions and the 
financial system more broadly. It will further damage healthcare. 
Additionally, recouping a loss is a basic tenet of a credit-based 
economy.
  This amendment would be disastrous on an already broken healthcare 
system. It would increase the cost of medical care and limit access to 
the care for all.
  For these reasons, Madam Speaker, I oppose this amendment, I 
encourage my colleagues to oppose it as well, and I reserve the balance 
of my time.
  Ms. TLAIB. How much time is remaining, Madam Speaker?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Michigan has 2\1/2\ 
minutes remaining.
  Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I remind my colleagues that all of these 
protections have already passed the House this Congress but have yet to 
receive action in the Senate.
  I want to remind my colleagues also the way the amendment is drafted 
right now currently, a medically necessary procedure is defined as, 
one, healthcare services or supplies needed to diagnose or treat an 
illness, injury, condition, disease, or symptom that meet accepted 
standards of medicine; two, healthcare to prevent illness and detect 
illnesses at an early stage when treatment is likely to work best, 
again, for services like Pap tests, flu shots, and screening mammograms
  I want to remind my colleagues, this is a huge barrier. The credit 
reports are huge barriers for housing and employment for our veterans. 
We continue to support increased housing for our veterans, increased 
mental health services for our veterans and all these other issues but, 
much of that is due to the fact that we have credit reports with 
medically necessary debt, medical procedures on there, and really no 
pathway to protect our consumers, our veterans, in this case.
  I really remind my colleagues again: we cannot continue to support 
housing and employment services for our veterans, and the credit 
report, the credit score, all of that, is holding them hostage unable 
to continue to create a good life in our country especially after 
sacrificing so much for our Nation.
  So I really ask my colleagues this is the right thing to do. Again, 
this is basically folks who are getting sick that need healthcare, and 
we are not saying that they won&#x27;t be able to collect, the healthcare 
agencies, they are able to collect. This is just to prevent it from 
becoming a barrier for many of our veterans who seek employment which 
does look at--many employers still now currently look at credit 
reports, and they also look at credit reports for housing. Again, we 
can&#x27;t continue to try to fund these kinds of supports when this is a 
huge barrier for our veterans.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, in closing, I would just reiterate that 
recouping a loss is a basic tenet of our credit-based economy. This 
amendment would further limit credit options for all Americans, hurting 
those who buy care from any place who can&#x27;t collect debts, and it would 
therefore hurt those who need this the most.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).
  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.

8</a>, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Slotkin) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Michigan.
  Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment which would take a 
number of steps to address PFAS contamination--a significant issue in 
my home State of Michigan and across the country. These include: 
Requiring a national primary drinking water regulation for PFAS.
  Strengthening disclosure requirements for manufacturers who discharge 
PFAS into our environment.
  And mandating the DOD comply with safe incineration standards for 
PFAS.
  My amendment would also ensure that the Department of Defense medical 
providers have the training they need to treat the effects of PFAS 
exposure.
  This provision could literally not be more straightforward. ``The 
Secretary of Defense shall provide to each medical provider of the 
Department of Defense mandatory training with respect to the potential 
health effects of PFAS.&#x27;&#x27;
  These potential health effects of PFAS exposure are serious. It has 
been linked to liver and kidney damage, thyroid problems, and cancer.
  Unfortunately, not all medical providers are familiar with the risks 
associated with PFAS exposure nor the steps that should be taken for 
those who have been exposed. That is where my amendment comes in. With 
necessary training, Department of Defense doctors would be able to 
identify effects before they get worse and refer their patients for 
appropriate treatment.
  I am glad we are making strides elsewhere in this NDAA to expand 
evaluation of servicemembers for PFAS exposure. This is something I 
have been fighting hard for. Our servicemen and -women deserve to know 
if they have been exposed to high levels of these dangerous chemicals.
  This amendment builds on these important provisions and prevents some 
of the situations we have already heard about whereby DOD firefighters 
are evaluated for PFAS exposure but not provided any additional 
guidance on what future treatment they should seek or side effects they 
should look out for.
  I am particularly proud that this amendment has garnered support from 
both sides of the aisle--Democrat and Republican--because the health of 
our servicemembers should not be a partisan issue.
  I want to thank my colleagues, Representatives Delgado, Fitzpatrick, 
Posey, Mace, Leger Fernandez, Ross, Sarbanes, and my fellow 
Michigander, Representative Levin, for their leadership on this package 
of amendments.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join in supporting these 
commonsense amendments which will give our men and women in uniform the 
knowledge and the tools that they need to protect themselves.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the en bloc amendment offered 
by Representative Slotkin which makes seven separate and substantive 
policy changes to the Armed Services Committee&#x27;s bill.
  This amendment, like the underlying NDAA, contains provisions that 
are under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, but 
we have never, never had a legislative hearing on these proposals.

                              {time}  2310

  Unfortunately, I fear the lack of due diligence on these provisions 
will create implementation confusion and burdensome outcomes, not just 
for the Department of Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency, 
but for everyday Americans.
  This amendment focuses on PFAS chemicals, an entire class of over 
9,000 chemicals. Broadly speaking, everyone wants to address PFAS 
contamination, but we have to do it in a smart and thoughtful way; 
otherwise, there are considerable consequences.
  Let me point out a few of consequences.
  First, the en bloc amendment&#x27;s provision related to an incineration 
moratorium does not use the defined term linking these provisions to 
the Defense Department, but addresses ``materials sent to another 
entity or entities.&#x27;&#x27;
  This makes it unclear who is subject to an incineration moratorium 
under section 318, potentially extending the temporary ban from just 
the military to any person.
  If the executive or judicial branches of our government adopt my 
reading of the en bloc amendment, it would have profound policy 
implications on waste, storage, and disposal practices in our country. 
Of greatest concern, a policy like this has the real potential to 
overwhelm existing landfill capacity and leave few viable disposal 
options for Americans. This is not the outcome we want.
  Setting this interpretation aside, though, this language creates a 
structure where the Federal Government is now deciding on the disposal 
methods of municipal solid waste. This is entirely unnecessary and 
impractical.
  Further, this framework disregards the Federal law governing these 
matters, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
  Second, the Toxic Release Inventory reporting threshold provisions in 
this amendment also contain problems. These provisions would 
statutorily deem these chemicals, without scientific review by EPA, 
chemicals of special concern and prohibit the use of existing 
exemptions.
  Complicating matters, EPA has only validated 29 measurement 
techniques for PFAS in drinking water. There are 172 PFAS currently 
subject to reporting, making measurements on 143 PFAS unreliable and 
subject to enforcement by EPA.
  Further expanding the reach of the Federal Government into areas 
without proper justification.
  Finally, the amount of people or entities that would need to report 
is unknown and could be huge, encompassing many parties who neither 
made nor added PFAS to their processes.
  It is a reasonable expectation for these stakeholders that, to prove 
they don&#x27;t have it, they will need to use invalid tests or potentially 
install filtering technology, even though there is no Federal standard.
  In another area, the en bloc amendment recycles provisions from the 
PFAS Action Act which the House voted on recently and E&C Republicans 
largely opposed. These requirements would create duplicate reporting 
and submission burdens on manufacturers and administrative resource 
constraints at EPA and potentially each State.
  EPA is already compelling data production on existing PFAS from the 
same people for the same ultimate purpose under Section 8(a)(7) of the 
Toxic Substances Control Act. It makes me wonder whether the purpose of 
these and other provisions is to get necessary information to EPA to 
help its essential data gaps and address PFAS contamination, or if this 
is about something else entirely different.
  Much of our debate about the PFAS Action Act surrounded the fact that 
it would lead to a de facto ban on these chemicals, and it will.
  No one opposes the effort to hold DOD accountable for its messes or 
to keep the men and women of the Armed Forces and surrounding 
communities safe from environmental harm. But before we act on the far-
reaching language of the amendment, not to mention some of the 
underlying bill, we need to know about the facts on the ground, 
especially for this motley crew of amendments.
  PFAS are a large class of chemicals, as I said, over 9,000, with 
essential uses, including many necessary for our national defense.

  There is a strong lesson here for the majority: Follow regular order; 
hold hearings and markups, and your work could result in practical, 
workable, and effective policy and a public law.
  Unfortunately, my Democrat friends have done the opposite here, 
seriously completing the chance this language has at becoming law. I 
oppose the amendment. I urge others to do the same.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.
  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment 
to add the first six titles of the Protecting America&#x27;s Wilderness in 
Public Lands Act to this year&#x27;s NDAA bill.
  This legislation will preserve nearly 1.3 million acres of public 
land across Colorado, California, and Washington State, and it will add 
more than 1,000 miles of river to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers 
System.
  Preserving these untouched public lands from the threat of future 
development is more than just protecting our environment. It is about 
protecting our economy and jobs and our western way of life. It is also 
about ensuring that some of our Nation&#x27;s most elite military pilots 
have the opportunity and the space they need to train.
  Included in the nearly 1.3 million acres of land this measure would 
protect are some of our Nation&#x27;s most important military training 
grounds, including the High Altitude Aviation Training Site, or HAATS, 
in Colorado, that is responsible for training some of our most elite 
helicopter pilots to take on some of the harshest conditions anywhere 
on the planet.
  As a fourth-generation Coloradoan, I know how important these lands 
are to the people in my State, and I know how important these training 
grounds are to the brave men and women who serve in our Nation&#x27;s 
military.
  The designations included in this amendment were not made up 
overnight. They were the result of decades of hard work by citizens 
across the State of Colorado, and they have garnered widespread support 
among the public across the West.
  It is why the legislation has been passed by this Chamber now three 
times in just 2 years, including as a part of last year&#x27;s NDAA bill, 
and again, this year, as a standalone bill.
  I want to thank my colleagues, Representatives Huffman, Carbajal, 
Chu, Schiff, Kilmer, Neguse, and the chairman of the Natural Resources 
Committee, Chairman Grijalva, for their unwavering support and all the 
work they have done to get this package to the floor.
  I urge all Members to vote ``yes&#x27;&#x27; on the amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized 
for 5 minutes.
  Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  I rise in opposition to this amendment to add a package of unrelated 
lands bills to the National Defense Authorization Act. Collectively, 
this pair of bills, this one and the next one, amendments, would impose 
unnecessary and harmful restrictions on more than 2\1/2\ million acres 
of lands in Colorado, California, and Washington, including nearly 1\1/
2\ million of acres of new wilderness designating many miles of wild 
and scenic rivers and creating 100,000 acres of national monument 
expansion.
  These restrictions will have the effect of greatly reducing 
opportunities for multiple uses of these lands and will restrict forest 
management practices that will render these lands more prone to 
catastrophic wildfires.
  In Colorado alone, this amendment would designate approximately 
570,000 acres of new wilderness areas, 23,000 acres of expanded 
wilderness, and 14,000 acres of potential wilderness.
  Now, we already have 3.5 million acres of public lands in Colorado 
that are designated as wilderness, so that protection is already there.

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4846">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4846">H4846</a></a>]]

  


                              {time}  2320

  Now, I do commend my colleague for her efforts to work with local 
stakeholders to address some of their concerns over the years that she 
has been working on this issue. But this package, unfortunately, does 
not come close to the kind of balance and consensus that should be 
required for a package of this magnitude. Many of the local communities 
impacted by this amendment and that I have heard from have raised 
significant concerns, including the loss of motorized access and 
recreation, which would threaten their local economy.
  A wilderness designation also makes it much more difficult or even 
impossible to remove excess fire hazards or invasive species. There is 
no real management of the land. Future generations lose access to the 
land, at least for average, everyday people. In a true wilderness area, 
you can&#x27;t even ride a bicycle.
  This bill is inconsistent with previous designations and existing 
land uses by arbitrarily adding wilderness areas and wild and scenic 
river designations where those designations are not really appropriate. 
Supporting the declaration of areas that do not actually possess these 
characteristics undermines the integrity of the Wilderness Act and the 
Wild and Scenic Rivers Act for what was originally intended.
  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Schiff).
  Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, the past 18 months have been difficult for 
all of us. But through the hardship, Americans have found solace and 
serenity in our beautiful public lands.
  Back home in Los Angeles, the Rim of the Valley Corridor stands out 
as a jewel of nature. We must preserve this area of striking beauty so 
that future generations can enjoy all that it has to offer.
  My amendment will add 191,000 acres of the Rim of the Valley Corridor 
to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, empowering the 
National Parks Service and the local community to better protect its 
natural resources and habitats.
  This is a cause I have worked on for two decades and one that has 
overwhelming support among my constituents and those in the region. 
Let&#x27;s get it over the finish line.
  Madam Speaker, I thank Representative DeGette for her extraordinary 
leadership, and I urge a ``yes&#x27;&#x27; vote on the amendment.
  Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Mrs. Boebert), who has a district where, actually, this 
designation would take place.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for 
yielding his time and for his leadership and protecting freedom for 
multiple uses of our public lands by opposing sloppy Democrat land 
grabs like the ones contained in this amendment.
  This amendment is loaded with more than 30 different land grabs that 
undermine our national security interests. I have actually traveled in 
helicopters with our servicemen and servicewomen who say that this bill 
would hinder the land that they currently practice over, with these 
wilderness designations, and it would prevent them from amazing 
training that they do, bringing people in worldwide.
  The U.S. Department of Defense uses 750,000 tons of minerals each 
year for equipment and other important technologies. Copper is used to 
manufacture military planes and ships. Silver is used in Apache 
helicopters. Beryllium is used to enhance the speed of fighter jets. 
Molybdenum is used for armored vehicles, missiles, and aircraft.
  The amendment we are discussing proposes to add nearly 1.5 million 
acres of new wilderness and permanently withdraws 1.2 million acres 
from mineral production.
  Again, our Department of Defense needs 750,000 tons of minerals each 
year. This amendment permanently withdraws 1.2 million acres that 
contain critical minerals and other rare earths that we need for 
defense, to protect our men and women in uniform.
  Approximately 550,000 of those 1.5 million acres that would be locked 
up by these new wilderness designations are in my district. Now, can 
you imagine if I had a bill designating the 16th Street Mall in Denver, 
Colorado, and said that there would be a wilderness designation. I 
mean, it is wild and scenic, but I don&#x27;t have a bill that does such 
because I tend to my district.
  None of the Colorado acres proposed for the wilderness designation in 
this amendment are located in the district represented by the sponsor 
of this amendment, and I urge a ``no&#x27;&#x27; vote.
  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Colorado has 2 minutes 
remaining. The time of the gentleman from Colorado has expired.
  Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Speaker, all of the six areas in this bill have been studied, 
have been worked on, and have been under consideration for several 
decades, as my colleague, Mr. Schiff, pointed out.
  The areas in Colorado in my bill were originally designated as 
wilderness study areas in the 1980s, and they have already been managed 
as wilderness for almost 40 years. What this would do is it would 
simply make permanent what everybody in Colorado knows. These are the 
most special wild areas that we can have.
  My colleague from Colorado alleges that helicopter training would be 
prevented by this bill, but, in fact, that is incorrect. After working 
with the National Guard, we withdrew the areas that were scheduled to 
be wilderness and called them potential wilderness so that the 
helicopters can continue to land there, as I pointed out in my opening 
statement, allowing our military to have the high-level training that 
they need.
  Finally, to my knowledge, there are no rare minerals in any of the 
six potential areas of this bill. In fact, what we are doing is simply 
preserving for future generations the wilderness that we all know and 
the wilderness that stimulates jobs and the economy throughout the 
West.
  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes&#x27;&#x27; on this amendment and preserve 
these very special places, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette).
  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from 
Colorado (Ms. DeGette).
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appear to have it.
  Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/8">House Resolution 
8</a>, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.


                 Amendment No. 17 Offered by Mr. Neguse

17 printed in part C of <a href="/congressional-report/117th-congress/house-report/125">House Report 117-125</a>.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Neguse) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.
  Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment with Chairman 
Grijalva. It would amend <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 4350</a> to add the text of two bills, <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/577">H.R. 
577</a>, the Colorado Outdoor Recreation and Economy Act, and <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1052">H.R. 1052</a>, 
the Grand Canyon Protection Act. These bills have already passed the 
House with bipartisan support not once, not twice, but three times.
  They would protect our public lands, natural resources, and Tribal 
cultural sites and help preserve access to our clean water, clean air, 
and a livable environment.

                              {time}  2330

  Of course, as climate change becomes a growing national security 
threat, we know that conservation becomes a moral imperative. My bill, 
the CORE Act, would conserve over 400,000 acres of public land and 
consists of four titles that Coloradans have been asking for Congress 
to pass literally for over a decade.
  One of those provisions that I would like to focus on tonight is the 
Camp Hale and 10th Mountain Division legacy. This includes establishing 
the first ever national historic landscape at Camp Hale in my district 
in honor of the storied legacy of the Army&#x27;s 10th Mountain Division in 
Colorado and around the world.
  It was in the mountains of Colorado that American soldiers received 
the training that allowed them to defeat Germans in the northern 
Italian Alps and lead our Nation to victory during World War II. Those 
same soldiers came back to the State of Colorado and literally built 
the modern ski industry in our wonderful State.
  Hut visitors share the special spirit of the 10th Mountain Division 
in their pursuit of excellence, self-reliance, and love of the 
outdoors, and my constituents in Summit County and Eagle County and 
across Colorado have been imploring the United States Congress to take 
steps to make these protections a reality, literally for years.
  As a result, Madam Speaker, I would encourage my colleagues to 
support this important amendment to protect our treasured public lands, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized 
for 5 minutes.
  Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes.
  I rise in opposition to this amendment because it restricts 
approximately 400,000 acres of land in Colorado, and although the 
stated goal of the language is to protect and enhance outdoor 
recreation--and I agree with that goal as stated--the practical effect 
of this amendment would not be that at all.
  For one thing, the active management of land that is under wilderness 
designation to prevent wildfires is much restricted, if not made 
impossible. In a State with a lot of wildfire risk, that is simply not 
acceptable.
  Rural county commissioners have talked to me and other opponents of 
this bill and have raised concerns about negative economic impact of 
the withdrawal of 200,000 acres of oil and gas land and what effect 
that would have on their communities.
  This amendment would also lock away approximately 1 million acres of 
public lands in Arizona and permanently ban mining and other multiple-
use activities in that State. This misguided and mistitled land grab 
has nothing to do with protecting the

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4856">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4856">H4856</a></a>]]

Grand Canyon. Instead, it seeks to ban development of one of the 
largest tracts of uranium deposits in the country.
  The result of this is to make us more reliant on adversaries such as 
Russia. We already import 97 percent of our uranium from foreign 
sources, and that would only become more precarious if this took 
effect. Since 2018, the majority of uranium imports have come from 
adversarial nations such as Russia.
  What this amendment is doing in the National Defense Act makes no 
sense at all.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, with much respect to my colleague from 
Colorado Springs, he knows, because we have debated this amendment 
every year for the last 3 years, every time we have successfully added 
this amendment to this particular bill, that the statements regarding 
this bill and the notion that it locks up land in the way that he 
describes is simply not true.
  He knows that this bill only includes 73,000 acres of wilderness with 
respect to the CORE Act. I know my colleague from Colorado Springs 
certainly is aware that this bill includes 80,000 acres for specific 
recreational use, to preserve the ability for folks to be able to go 
mountain biking and to enjoy those outdoor areas. Of course, that is 
why this particular bill has so much support from local communities.
  I was a bit surprised, Madam Speaker, to hear this notion that county 
commissioners have talked to my colleague from Colorado Springs. I 
would suggest that he talk to the county commissioners in Gunnison 
County, in Pitkin County, in San Juan County, in San Miguel County, in 
Eagle County, or perhaps the city councils in Avon, Basalt, Carbondale, 
Crested Butte, Glenwood Springs, perhaps Gunnison, maybe Mountain 
Village, Ridgway, Telluride. I don&#x27;t want to go through all of the 
communities, Madam Speaker, because I would expend my entire 5 minutes.
  I think my point is fairly clear, which is that this bill has broad 
support within the communities that it would impact, and therefore I 
would certainly encourage my colleagues again to support this 
particular amendment.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, let&#x27;s actually hear from Representatives 
who live in these areas.
  I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).
  Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this 
amendment.
  This amendment includes the Grand Canyon Protection Act, falsely 
named legislation, which has nothing to do with the Grand Canyon and is 
a cover for a giant Federal land grab that hurts our economy and our 
national security.
  This land grab of over one million acres in my State will destroy as 
many as 4,000 jobs and cost $29 billion in sacrificed economic 
activity.
  Now, I am perplexed that the majority would bring this up under the 
National Defense Authorization as this reckless land grab actually 
hurts our national security. We heard from the gentleman from Colorado 
that these are areas where we have some high grade uranium. In fact, 
the costarter of Greenpeace, Michael Shellenberger, has actually said 
that if you want a green economy like the other side does, you 
definitely have to have nuclear, and this is one of those ways.

  But we constantly keep going down this road where we make ourselves 
dependent on other countries, like Russia, Uzbekistan, and those areas. 
Isn&#x27;t it interesting that we want to subjugate ourselves to foreign 
interests and foreign oversight? That is not the way we should be doing 
it. We should have our own way of doing it.
  Last but not least, the way uranium is actually leached into the 
atmosphere is by air and by water, which are the portals that these 
breccia pipes have contained. Actually, taking the breccia pipes out of 
this area actually makes it easier for penetration of water in our 
subsurface areas.
  I urge this not be adopted and once again return it back to our 
States for any other jurisdiction.
  Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains 
on both sides?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Neguse) has 
1 minute remaining. The gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) has 2 
minutes remaining.
  Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Colorado (Mrs. Boebert). The gentlewoman is from the western part 
of the State where this would actually take place, and I believe she is 
in touch with the people in her district.
  Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, this amendment, which has nothing to do 
with the national defense, creates significant land restrictions on 
nearly 400,000 acres of land in Colorado.
  This entirely inappropriate amendment to the NDAA seeks to create 
73,068 acres of new wilderness in Colorado, which will severely 
restrict all forms of recreation, much-needed management, and economic 
activity. We can all agree that we need forest management, and the 
answer is not a hands-off approach.
  While there are a lot of terrible policies in this amendment, one of 
my biggest concerns is the increased threat of disastrous wildfires 
that will result from the new wilderness designations and other land 
grabs in this bill.
  Colorado just came out of one of the worst wildfire seasons we have 
ever experienced. In 2020 the U.S. set a new record for the number of 
acres burned by wildfires, as more than 10.3 million acres went up in 
smoke.
  Wilderness is the most restrictive land use designation possible, and 
it prevents active management in our forests, which is critical to 
prevent catastrophic wildfires.
  I have spent months meeting with foresters, experts in the timber 
industry, and active management advocates. Every one of them has said 
we do not need wilderness areas in Colorado, and wilderness areas 
prevent active management of our forests and have exacerbated 
catastrophic wildfires.
  Madam Speaker, this amendment is a blatant attempt to sneak a deeply 
partisan environmentalist wish list into the vital and important 
funding vehicle of our Nation&#x27;s defense.

                              {time}  2340

  Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I would just again say I think many of the 
communities that I referenced and the various stakeholders that have 
been engaged and working on this bill would take offense at this notion 
that it is some, I think the word used was secret environmental wish 
list or whatever the case may be.
  Clearly this bill, in particular the CORE Act, has broad local 
support.
  With respect to wildfires, my district was the site of the first and 
second largest wildfires in the history of Colorado in 137 years. It is 
why we created a bipartisan wildfire caucus working with several 
Republicans in the United States Congress to come together on solutions 
that would address this epidemic of pervasive wildfires across the 
Rocky Mountain west.
  This bill is about protecting the legacy of public lands in Colorado 
and across the western United States to ensure that our children can 
enjoy the same public lands that we are so blessed and treasured to 
have in our State.
  Madam Speaker, again, I would urge a ``yes&#x27;&#x27; vote, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, just like the previous amendment, this 
amendment was successfully added to last year&#x27;s NDAA, but the conferees 
properly dropped it from the final conference report, so it ultimately 
failed. It is simply unacceptable that we would add an amendment to the 
National Defense Authorization Act that not only has nothing to do with 
national defense, but this actually hurts our national defense by 
empowering adversaries like Russia with their uranium production while 
limiting our own domestic national production of uranium.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. Neguse).
  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from

  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appear to have it.
  Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/8">House Resolution

  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Kim) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.
  Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I rise to offer my amendment 
that will help countless struggling small businesses and communities 
access new opportunities and unlock the local economic potential of 
military bases across the country.
  My amendment would incentivize the use of local small businesses for 
military construction projects by asking the Secretary of Defense to 
provide preference for businesses that will use workers from within the 
same State or within a 60-mile radius from where the work will occur.
  My amendment would also strengthen a provision in the underlying bill 
to finally provide some transparency in the military construction 
project award process, helping small businesses at least be aware of 
when possible contracts and subcontract opportunities become available.
  I represent Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, which for decades has 
been an economic engine in my community and in my State with thousands 
of jobs tied to operations on the base.
  However, too often contracts at bases like mine go unseen by small, 
local businesses who are qualified and ready and sometimes more cost 
effective than contractors from out of State.
  Since coming into Congress, I have met with business owners from 
around the Joint Base who have stressed to me that not only are they 
not considered for military construction contracts, but in many cases 
the Department of Defense does not even make local businesses aware of 
the contracts that are available.
  I introduced the Put Our Neighbors to Work Act and offer it as an 
amendment here for the construction workers in my district who are 
looking for their next opportunity and to provide some fairness to the 
award process for small and local businesses who have been passed over 
for far too long.
  This is a good amendment that would help to expand opportunities for 
small and local businesses in the construction industry at a time when 
so many across the country are struggling.
  I would like to thank Congressman Norcross, Congressman Garamendi, 
and Congressman Pfluger for helping push this bipartisan effort 
forward.
  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up for small 
and local businesses by voting to pass this legislation.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this 
amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Utah is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, I oppose this amendment 
passionately as I jumped into a debate on this during general debate, 
because I am so excited to jump into it. I appreciate the opportunity 
to speak.
  This to me is a classic case of we agree, we just are seeing a very 
different approach in how we want to go about doing this. I have 
enjoyed my time on the Armed Services Committee immensely these past 9 
months, and for one reason alone, we can find areas of collaboration 
and areas that we can work on together.
  Military construction that will go towards projects like providing 
housing for our men and women serving is a top priority across the 
board for Democrats and Republicans. I am going to highlight just some 
of the fundamental, key reasons why this amendment and many others, 
especially industry folks, with respect to the chamber of commerce, the 
National Defense Industry of America, the Associated General 
Contractors of America, and American Council of Engineering Companies, 
they oppose this effort.
  In addition to the industry side, and I never thought that I would 
say this as I start my debate, President Biden

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4858">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4858">H4858</a></a>]]

and his administration are also in opposition to this for a few key 
reasons.
  One, this impacts skilled workforce. The local hiring preferences 
would significantly impact the military construction contractors&#x27; 
workforce by creating scenarios where long-term, highly skilled workers 
may have to be laid off in order to meet local hire mandates. Then, in 
order to comply with the requirements, employers would have to bring in 
unnecessary and unskilled workers to fill those now vacant positions, 
creating additional costs and safety concerns.
  Local preference requirements falsely assumes that there is a local 
pool of qualified military contractors at the ready, and they are 
capable of performing the work. In the language you see, the language 
even uses ``when practical.&#x27;&#x27; And I always struggle with that, because 
how can we legislate on ``when practical&#x27;&#x27;?
  I believe we should let the individuals that are putting out bids and 
winning these contracts determine what they can best do for those 
areas.

  Now, I am a huge supporter of local support. And you can go to Hill 
Air Force Base in Layton, Utah, to find out how we have been able to 
embrace the local community and enhanced use-lease projects. We are 
doing it better than anywhere else in the country, and I am firm on it, 
and I am actually willing to share the best practices, and I am pushing 
hard to change up some of these budget requirements or these labeling 
requirements so we can kind of blow through the issues that we have.
  The MILCON budget is overloaded right now. We do not have the money 
to do a fraction of the projects that we have out there. Like I 
mentioned earlier, bricks are literally falling off the dormitories for 
our airmen.
  Other reasons to oppose it. This is contrary to judicial precedence. 
Leslie Miller, Inc. versus Arkansas, the Supreme Court ruling held that 
the bid on Federal contracts cannot be required to first submit state 
licensing procedures. It undermines competition.
  And lastly, but most importantly, it increases cost to contractors 
and government at a time where we don&#x27;t have enough money in our MILCON 
budget to add additional costs.
  So again, with the increased costs right now every construction 
company I talk to are bursting at the seams with potential projects and 
no labor to do it. If we add on additional requirements to hire 
specifically locally, even if the contract is sort of similar, if you 
do the base in Tinker and then you go to Air Force base, and you go to 
Wright-Patt, there is consistency there. There is opportunity to scale. 
This is a fundamental business concept where we have to be able to 
leverage and allow for business and industry to thrive and do this more 
cost effectively.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

                              {time}  2350

  Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I am glad that we are able to 
have this debate and talk about what it is that we are trying to 
prioritize here. When we are talking about the workers here, this bill, 
this amendment, is not something that would force the Secretary of 
Defense to hire unqualified workers to be able to work on our bases. 
That is absolutely not the case here.
  It is talking about, in the circumstances where there are qualified 
workers, wouldn&#x27;t we want to prioritize the local workers that are part 
of that community?
  We are proud in my district to host a military base. We are proud in 
New Jersey to have multiple different military installations, and I am 
sure other States are very proud of the military installations that 
they host as well.
  I hope that the Department of Defense is proud of that partnership 
with our States. That is exactly what this is. It is a partnership. 
This can be a win-win. In the same way that we are looking out for our 
joint military base in our community, we would like the joint military 
base to think of itself as part of that community.
  I believe in the workforce of my State and other States, and I 
believe that the workforce across America is strong. I believe that we 
have the skilled labor all over this country to be able to do this.
  That is why we have been able to get this bipartisan bill. That is 
why I have been able to get the support of Congressman Pfluger and to 
be able to continue to move forward in the way that we need to do this 
for our small businesses, for our workers, to be able to help build 
strong national security.
  Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of 
my time.
  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Utah has the right to 
close.
  Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I urge support for my 
amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, I am just going to reiterate the 
concept of the enhanced use lease that is done better than anywhere 
else that I have discussed or heard or seen at our base in Utah.
  I want to take this opportunity to highlight that that is embracing 
the local workforce, and it is doing it more cost-effectively on 
multiple different types of projects.
  I am going to continue to push for us to embrace that concept more 
within all of our military bases because it has proven to be a really 
good model to do it more cost-effectively and with the right type of 
labor.
  This adds an extra burden that is unnecessary to be able to 
accomplish what we want it to. I will again reiterate that increased 
costs to a MILCON budget that can&#x27;t even do the work that it is trying 
to do right now is only going to exacerbate the issue. We need to let 
these companies that bid on these projects do this the appropriate way 
and without adding a whole bunch of extra burdens.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. Kim).
  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Kim).
  The amendment was agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair understands that amendment No. 19 
will not be offered at this time.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.
  Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Sherman-Waters 
amendment, No. 746.
  Madam Speaker, for quite some time, Chairwoman Waters and I have been 
in favor of strong sanctions against Russia for interference in our 
elections.
  Now, I don&#x27;t want this to be partisan. There is this idea that only 
Democrats care about protecting our elections from Russian 
interference. That is not the case.
  When the Senate was controlled by Republicans, the Senate 
Intelligence Committee issued a report stating: ``The Russian 
Government engaged in an aggressive, multifaceted effort to influence, 
or attempt to influence, the outcome of the 2016 Presidential 
election.&#x27;&#x27; But there are those who think that perhaps President Trump 
did not believe that Russia tried to influence our elections.
  Putting aside 2016, what did the Trump administration say about our 
2018 election?
  On September 30, 2019, the Trump Treasury Department announced 
sanctions in response to Russian interference in our 2018 election, and 
then the Trump administration imposed sanctions on a ``Russian agent&#x27;&#x27; 
for trying to influence our 2020 election. Partisanship stops at the 
water&#x27;s edge.
  We need to stop Russia from interfering in our elections. Both 
parties have imposed sanctions on Russia for doing so. The question is 
how we make those sanctions effective.
  Existing sanctions apply to the purchase of sovereign debt--this is 
debt issued by the Russian Government--but only when you are acting as 
the underwriter, not purchases in the secondary market. That is 
ineffective.
  In May of this year, the Russian Deputy Finance Minister told us that 
when he said sanctions-imposed restrictions don&#x27;t cover the secondary 
market and so they are going to be ineffective or, in his words: ``So 
we don&#x27;t expect the share of nonresidents to move far from the current 
levels.&#x27;&#x27;
  We need to listen to the Russian Deputy Finance Minister as to how to 
make the sanctions that both Democrats and Republicans agree on more 
effective. The sanctions imposed here will raise the cost of borrowing 
of the Russian Government by between half a

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4860">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4860">H4860</a></a>]]

percent and three-quarters of a percent based on a rating by ACRA.
  Further, it is good economic policy. We have a scarce amount of 
investment capital in the United States. I want to see it invested in 
American businesses, either in stock or as loans by our banks and 
others to our companies.
  Can anybody make the argument that we are worse off if money is 
invested in American companies instead of being lent to Vladimir Putin?
  There is no credible argument as to why American pension plans, asset 
managers, and households should be funding the Russian Government at a 
time when, in 2016, 2018, and 2020, both parties and former President 
Trump realized that Russia was interfering in our elections and 
deserves to be sanctioned. Let&#x27;s make those sanctions effective by 
adopting this amendment.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, it is my understanding that the 
ranking member of the committee of jurisdiction is opposed. Therefore, 
I must be opposed.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have 
remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California has 1\1/2\ 
minutes remaining.
  Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, I see no substantive reason why the 
ranking member is opposed to this amendment. Both parties agree Russia 
has interfered in our elections in 2016 but more recently in 2018 and 
2020. Both parties and the Trump administration agree that Russia 
should be sanctioned. But the Deputy Finance Minister of Russia pointed 
out that our sanctions so far have not been effective, that they are 
not effective until they apply to the secondary market.
  That is exactly what this amendment does. It is time to raise the 
cost of borrowing by the Russian Government and to see that money 
invested in American businesses, lent to American companies, instead of 
being lent to the Russian Government.
  Madam Speaker, I hear no substantive argument against that 
proposition, and I urge adoption of the amendment.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentleman 
from California (Mr. Sherman).
  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Sherman).
  The amendment was agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

No. 22 will not be offered at this time.


                 Amendment No. 23 Offered by Mr. Schiff

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
23 printed in part C of <a href="/congressional-report/117th-congress/house-report/125">House Report 117-125</a>.
  Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of subtitle C of title V, add the following new 
     section:

     SEC. 5__. EXCLUSION OF EVIDENCE OBTAINED WITHOUT PRIOR 
                   AUTHORIZATION.

       Section 271 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by 
     adding at the end the following new subsection:
       ``(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any 
     information obtained by or with the assistance of a member of 
     the Armed Forces in violation of section 1385 of title 18, 
     shall not be received in evidence in any trial, hearing, or 
     other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, 
     department, officer, agency, regulatory body, legislative 
     committee, or other authority of the United States, a State, 
     or a political subdivision thereof.&#x27;&#x27;.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.
  Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, this amendment clarifies the authority of 
military commission judges to order court processing at Guantanamo to 
be broadcast over the internet. This is a straightforward, 
noncontroversial amendment that the House has passed twice by voice 
vote.
  The GAO has studied this issue and concluded there are no technical 
barriers to broadcasting proceedings on the internet, and it can be 
done while protecting classified information.
  This amendment comes down to simply whether or not we believe the 
American people have the right to observe the military commission 
proceedings, including against members of al-Qaida who planned the 9/11 
attacks.
  I believe that families of victims, journalists, academics, NGOs, and 
any American interested should be able to follow the proceedings 
without flying to Guantanamo, a difficult and lengthy process at best. 
I also believe this amendment is important because these military 
commissions have, in fact, failed.
  After so many years, they have not delivered anything that could be 
called justice, but their distance hides the extent of their failings.
  As we work toward closing Guantanamo, which I strongly support, we 
should cease to hide the legal processes happening there.
  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes&#x27;&#x27; vote, and I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, the amendment allows some of 
the most hardened terrorists in U.S. custody a platform to publicly 
broadcast their message. Letting these vicious terrorists know there is 
a public audience for their hate will do far more harm than good.
  It is important to note that Federal courts have consistently stuck 
to their guns against broadcasting major terrorism cases, such as the 
trial of Zacarias Moussaoui. I see no reason to make an exception for 
terrorists at Guantanamo.
  DOD has informed us they share these serious concerns and strongly 
oppose this amendment.
  Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose the amendment, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I would simply point out that this 
amendment permits these judges to broadcast the proceedings so that 
people can witness them. It doesn&#x27;t mandate that this be done in every 
case. I think these judges ought to have the discretion to do so.
  This amendment makes it very clear that GAO has studied this issue 
and found that it is more than technologically feasible.
  I think it is important that the American people, particularly the 
victims of 9/11 who would like to witness these proceedings, be allowed 
to do so. The victims of 9/11 can&#x27;t easily travel--many of them can&#x27;t 
travel at all--to Guantanamo to review the proceedings. I think that 
the victims of that heinous terrorist attack should have the ability to 
face those and observe the proceedings against those who have been 
charged with those offenses.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I have a right to close, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my 
time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama does have the 
right to close.
  Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes&#x27;&#x27; vote on this amendment to 
increase transparency into the proceedings in Guantanamo and allow the 
victims of 9/11 to observe the proceedings, as many of them would like 
to, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I am concerned that adoption of 
this amendment would create a major recruiting platform for terrorists 
and create security risks.
  The Biden administration is opposed to this amendment. I oppose this 
amendment, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no.&#x27;&#x27; I yield back 
the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the

                 Amendment No. 24 Offered by Mr. Schiff

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
24 printed in part C of <a href="/congressional-report/117th-congress/house-report/125">House Report 117-125</a>.
  Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of subtitle C of title X, insert the following:

     SEC. 1024. PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF MILITARY COMMISSION 
                   PROCEEDINGS.

       Section 949d(c) of title 10, United States Code, is amended 
     by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
       ``(4) In the case of any proceeding of a military 
     commission under this chapter that is made open to the 
     public, the military judge may order arrangements for the 
     availability of the proceeding to be watched remotely by the 
     public through the internet.&#x27;&#x27;.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.
  Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this amendment.
  In June 2020, as individuals came together to proclaim that Black 
lives matter and speak out against the murder of George Floyd, Donald 
Trump saw these lawful protests as an opportunity to once again abuse 
the power of his office.
  The former President threatened to deploy U.S. military units to 
cities across the country to serve as de facto law enforcement. The 
threat only heightened an already tense situation and risked 
catastrophe had he followed through.
  The posse comitatus laws protect American citizens against the abuse 
of the military as a domestic law enforcement agency, but it has 
loopholes that need to be fixed. My amendment would do so.
  The goals of this amendment are simple: strengthen restrictions to 
ensure the mission of the U.S. military cannot be abused and protect 
the civil liberties of our citizens.
  Madam Speaker, I urge support of the amendment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Ohio is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, we already have laws that prohibit the 
United States military from carrying out domestic policy on United 
States soil. This amendment would prohibit evidence obtained by the 
military in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act from being used in a 
court or other legal proceedings.
  While I am actually sympathetic and believe this issue is one that is 
worthy of our consideration in its current form, I urge opposition. The 
issue is simply too complex to rush through here without careful 
consideration and deliberation in regular order.
  The implications of this amendment are also unclear. We have a crisis 
on our southern border, a crisis that continues to be ignored by 
Democrats and is continually getting worse. What happens, for example, 
if the continued failures of the Biden policies cause the situation at 
our southern border to become so dire that our military is called to 
secure our border and the military obtains evidence of trafficking or 
smuggling or some other crime?
  We simply do not know enough about changing this longstanding legal 
document here today to jam it into a National Defense Authorization 
Act. This is an issue that needs to go through a more robust process 
where the committees of jurisdiction can hold hearings and fully 
explore all possible consequences.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, it is not that complicated. The current 
posse comitatus laws prohibit violation of this rule against using the 
military for law enforcement purposes but apply it only to two branches 
of the military, the Army and the Air Force. This would extend it to 
the other branches of the military. It is as simple as that.
  It also provides that if you violate the law, you shouldn&#x27;t use the 
evidence from the violation of that law in court proceedings. That is a 
well-established principle of criminal law, and it ought to apply here 
as well.
  It is really quite simple. That is what this amendment would do.
  Madam Speaker, I urge support, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I believe I have the right to close on 
this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California is correct.
  Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, who has the right to close?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California has the right 
to close.

                              {time}  0010

  Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, in closing, I would just say the gentleman 
in his introduction of the amendment said that while President Trump--
he talked about President Trump and the riots that took place last 
summer--he said, well, I would just point out that while President 
Trump was talking about deploying the military to deal with the riots 
that were happening in so many major urban areas around our great 
country, what were Democrats doing?
  What were Democrats doing?
  They were defunding the police, and they were raising money to bail 
the very rioters out who were destroying property and attacking police 
officers to raise money to bail those individuals out of jail. And now 
here tonight we have some policy that hasn&#x27;t been through committee and 
hasn&#x27;t been through any process trying to be put into the National 
Defense Authorization Act.
  Again, Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to this, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I will now close.
  This amendment is quite simple. It would extend the posse comitatus 
law to all branches of the military so it is not abused.
  This is not about defunding the police. That is the usual red herring 
argument when there is no argument to be made on the merits.
  So this would simply say that the prohibition against abusing the 
military and dragooning it as a method of enforcing domestic laws ought 
to be extended to every branch of the military not just two of the 
branches of the military. And those who would violate this law cannot 
use evidence gained in violation of the law against individuals. So 
that is what this amendment would do.
  Madam Speaker, I urge its passage, and I yield back the balance of my 
time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentleman 
from California (Mr. Schiff).
  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Schiff).
  The amendment was agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

consideration of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 4350</a> is postponed.
