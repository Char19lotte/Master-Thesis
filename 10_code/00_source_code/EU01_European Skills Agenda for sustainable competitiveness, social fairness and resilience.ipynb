      "Nicolas Schmit , Member of the Commission . – Madam President , honourable Members , first I want to thank you , and in particular the Members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , for this question on a very important topic . Indeed the Skills Agenda is the centrepiece of our efforts to bring to life the principles of the UN pillar of social rights and notably principle number one . This principle states that everyone , I quote , ‘ has the right to quality and inclusive education , training and lifelong learning. ’ We need to invest in people and in building a strong human capital to prepare and accompany the green and digital transitions , as well as to respond to the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis . Our goal is to empower people with education and training , with a view to boosting the creation of quality jobs and setting the conditions for a more innovative , competitive , inclusive and sustainable development model . You rightfully asked about the progress we made in implementing the European Skills Agenda . The agenda was adopted by the Commission on 1 July 2020 . It is a five-year plan to help Europe develop more and better skills and to put them to good use . Since last July , 7 of the agenda ’ s 12 flagship actions have already been launched . Such actions include the Council recommendation on vocational education and training which we already had the pleasure of discussing in this House . We have also launched the new Europass platform . The remaining five actions will be launched in 2021 , notably the initiatives on Individual Learning Accounts and on micro-credentials . The agenda is centred around inclusive learning . It is vital to address this point across all actions , for example in the Council recommendation on vocational education and training . We also underlined the importance of digital skills , and digital education and training . This is even more fundamental in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic . Therefore the digital education plan for 2021-2027 adopted on 30 September 2020 puts forward inclusion as one of its guiding principles . We are also working on the Skills for Life initiatives to reach out to the most vulnerable and to create concrete opportunities for engaging with learning . Our ambitions will fail to reach that goal if we collectively do not invest . We need to make the best use of the unprecedented funding of the Union budget to tackle the economic and social consequences of this crisis . This includes of course the European Social Fund+ which can now be implemented following the agreement in trilogue between Parliament and Council ’ s negotiators very recently . Additionally , the Commission has encouraged Member States to use the Recovery and Resilience Facility where one of the seven flagship initiatives for reforms and investments is re-skill and upskill . The European Parliament has played a central role in strengthening the position of education and skills in the legal framework of the Recovery and Resilience Facility . I thank you for that as there can be no recovery and no resilience if we do not ensure adequate investment in skills and in quality jobs , especially also in the transition from one job to another . Member States should put a strong emphasis on investment in skills in their national recovery and resilience plans , but we are working now with Member States to make sure that upskilling and re-skilling is a top focus area . This is not all . Skills are a shared responsibility and it is essential for everybody to play their part . This is why we will put in place a number of measures to unlock private investment in skills . We will look at how fiscal frameworks can do better to support reforms and investment in skills , and how enterprises could better report on their employees ’ skills development . All these efforts culminate in the Pact for Skills , which Commissioner Breton and I launched on 10 November 2020 . The pact represents a shared engagement model for skills development . Partnerships should be created in order to respond to the skills challenges in different sectors and should involve social partners , too . To date , three skills partnerships are already in place and altogether EUR 11 billion have been committed by partners in industrial ecosystems to upskill their workforce in the coming years . Yes , the question of helping Member States to align their national education systems with the labour market is an important one . Of course the organisation and content of education and training is a matter for the Member States , but targeted and up-to-date skills intelligence can help align training with evolving labour market needs , as well as support individuals in their choices . As part of the Skills Agenda the Commission , in cooperation with Eurostat and the EU Agency Cedefop , is improving and making more widely available such skills intelligence at regional and sectoral level . Let me give you just one example . A Big Data initiative using artificial intelligence has analysed over 150 million job vacancies across Europe . This is an example of assessing skills needs in real time . The results are already online and the Commission is disseminating our findings with key stakeholders such as the European network of public employment services and with social partners . The Skills Agenda already in its name sets the path towards which we have to go : sustainable competitiveness , social fairness and resilience , and I know that I can count on this Parliament to go on this path .

    "raw1_4 = 'Andrea Bocskor, on behalf of the PPE Group. - President! Resource scarcity, the transition to a resource-efficient, digital and climate-neutral economy, and the expanding use of artificial intelligence pose new challenges for the employment and labor markets. New professions are emerging as existing ones are transformed or eliminated. This is a clear signal that rapid change in skills and competences is needed for the competitiveness of the European Union and its Member States. The Covid19 pandemic accelerated the digital transition and showed the level of digital skills of different age groups. Due to security measures, most of our activities have moved into the digital space, with teleworking and distance learning becoming part of everyday life for millions, bringing to the surface the limits of our digital preparedness. I am pleased that the new European Skills Agenda also aims to help address the economic and labor market challenges posed by the Covid epidemic. I welcome the forward-looking proposals and it is important that it shows a sustainable path for the next generation. Modern, innovative and quality education and training, which are directly linked to the labor market and societal needs, must play a key role in skills development and help to equip young people with important skills that will prepare them for real life. Vocational training and lifelong learning must be given priority, as it is very important, through training and retraining, to be able to remain in the labor market at all times, and it is very important to think not only of young people, but also of adults and the elderly.'"

      "Andrea Bocskor , on behalf of the PPE Group . - President ! Resource scarcity , the transition to a resource-efficient , digital and climate-neutral economy , and the expanding use of artificial intelligence pose new challenges for the employment and labor markets . New professions are emerging as existing ones are transformed or eliminated . This is a clear signal that rapid change in skills and competences is needed for the competitiveness of the European Union and its Member States . The Covid19 pandemic accelerated the digital transition and showed the level of digital skills of different age groups . Due to security measures , most of our activities have moved into the digital space , with teleworking and distance learning becoming part of everyday life for millions , bringing to the surface the limits of our digital preparedness . I am pleased that the new European Skills Agenda also aims to help address the economic and labor market challenges posed by the Covid epidemic . I welcome the forward-looking proposals and it is important that it shows a sustainable path for the next generation . Modern , innovative and quality education and training , which are directly linked to the labor market and societal needs , must play a key role in skills development and help to equip young people with important skills that will prepare them for real life . Vocational training and lifelong learning must be given priority , as it is very important , through training and retraining , to be able to remain in the labor market at all times , and it is very important to think not only of young people , but also of adults and the elderly .

Normally, when we approach the debate about competitions, we think that these are neutral and accessible to everyone and that getting them or not only depends on our merits and efforts.

For example, capabilities are not independent of gender or ethnic stereotypes and, therefore, neither are the opportunities to obtain them throughout our lives. And individualizing the responsibility of each person in relation to the skills they are capable of acquiring is unfair, because we do not all have the same opportunities, especially considering the educational inequalities with which we enter the labor market and which have increased, furthermore , with the pandemic.

Skills are actually the key ingredient for our future. It’s about our small entrepreneurs, it’s about research, it’s about how we produce the vaccines for the population, and it’s at the core of productive activity. Skills are actually about the social underpinnings of independent living, having good wages and being able to provide for your family. Skills are about the future of our society. There is no Green Deal or digital transformation without proper skill investment. Here we are with the ambitious new Skills Agenda for Europe before us. We are in the Parliament, putting the right questions and coming with our own contribution to this very important debate. There are three major things to remember. It’s about coordination, how we better coordinate so that skills are going to be sought in all the policy areas, and how we are going to have efficient implementation and transform the words in this nice motion for resolution into facts. That’s the question for the Commission. How do we use that funding for the future? This is the most important thing. So repeat after me: skills, skills, skills.

Behind these bombastic formulas hides a harsher reality that you do not assume, as usual: that of an economic crisis which is only in its infancy, with the corollary of endemic unemployment to which uncontrolled immigration is no stranger. According to the latest Eurostat report of November 2020 concerning the European Union, there are more than 3 million young people under the age of 25 unemployed, which corresponds to an increase of almost 17% in just one year. In parallel with this damning observation, the European Commission recently affirmed that immigration would represent an inexhaustible source of talent. We walk on the head! When I see that the CEO of AstraZeneca is a Frenchman, I tell myself that geniuses, in France as in Europe, we are full of them. But for lack of political will and vision, and because of under-investment in training and scientific research, you scared them away.

The EU and Member States must avoid the creation of new gaps resulting from unequal access to technology, especially between generations, gender and between rural areas and cities. As Socialists and Democrats, we will stand with EU citizens and will support them to embrace transition without forgetting to strengthen, next to their skills, also their personal development and critical thinking. In a changing world, being aware of the necessity of the new skills agenda is crucial for both workers and employers.'\n",
