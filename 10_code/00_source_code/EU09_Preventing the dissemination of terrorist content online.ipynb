      "Patryk Jaki , rapporteur . – Madam President , we live in difficult times . The terrorist threat to our community is still present and it is our responsibility to keep citizens safe and to prevent terrorist attacks . However , in order to do so , it is necessary to understand the terrorists ’ modus operandi and its evolution . As an example , I will use the long—standing statement of Umar Patek , the organiser of terrorist attacks on Bali in which more than 200 people were killed . He said , during his trial , for those who do not know how to commit Jihad , they should understand that there are several ways to know Jihad . This is not the Stone Age . This is the internet age . We have Facebook , we have Twitter . As he said , this is what happened . The internet has become the most important safe haven and tool for terrorists today . On the internet , terrorists recruit by spreading propaganda , including among children and young people . They provide attacks and violence from the internet , spreading propaganda to youngsters and children . There they show their attack , call for attack and spread a radical agenda . As a continuation , let me show some examples . In 2020 , Facebook removed 43.4 million pieces of content of a terrorist nature or containing incitement to attack . In the previous year , it was 25.5 million pieces of content , so as you can see , it is a significant increase with the advent of pandemics and people being locked in their homes . In 2019 , Twitter reported that it blocked more than 300 000 accounts linked to a terrorist organisation or used to spread terrorist propaganda both linked to radical Islam and to left- and right-wing extremes . In 2016 , it was 100 000 accounts , so one can see an upward trend . Today , terrorist groups have their own media , magazines , editors . The internet and modern technology have allowed terrorist groups to post content that they fully control . A staff of specialists from such terrorist groups prepares professional information and propaganda campaigns , documentaries and magazines published online . They ’ ve directed executions . That is why our response was needed . The regulation will allow Member State to immediately remove terrorist content . It has introduced , among others , the principle of one hour , which means that the most dangerous content will be removed as soon as possible after publication . For example , Member States finally received a working tool to stop live broadcasting from a terrorist attack or mass shooting . This is a groundbreaking project and the first in the history of the EU that implements such a powerful tool in cross-border cooperation between Member States in this area . One country will have the right to send a removal order to another country . The order will apply to everyone in the EU , including those outside the EU . Failure to comply with the order will result in large financial penalties . The new regulation will help to counter the spread of extremist ideology online . The regulation will ensure that what is illegal offline is illegal online . Removal orders can be sent by any Member State to any online platform established within the EU . However , according to the compromise reached , the authorities of the Member States where the content host is located will have 72 hours to analyse and possibly challenge the withdrawal order if it sees , for example , a clear violation of freedom of expression . In addition , we are carrying a new framework for the cooperation between public institutions and the private sector . We will all now have a duty to act in solidarity to tackle terrorism . This regulation will ensure that the online platforms play a more active role in detecting terrorist content online and that such content is removed within a maximum of one hour . At the same time , potential threats to freedom have been removed . There will be no mandatory filtering of the internet . New safeguards for freedom of speech , freedom of press and media , as well as freedom for legal content , for instance , journalists ’ research , artists , educational content , too . Moreover , it safeguards content which represents an expression of polemics or controversial views in the course of public debate . It was a very difficult project . Thanks to the involvement of Parliament ’ s excellent negotiation team , whom I would like to thank , it was possible to reach a compromise . I would also like to thank the Commissioner and the Council . I strongly believe that the Terrorist Content ( TC ) Regulation is a good and balanced text which balances security and the freedom of speech and expression on the internet , protecting legal content and access to information for every citizen in the EU . It is a new tool based on mutual cooperation and trust between States fighting together in the one cause against terrorists . The Europe Union today has gained a powerful new tool to fight terrorists , and this is very good information for our community . "

      "Ylva Johansson , Member of the Commission . – Madam President , this is an extremely important debate . This regulation will make it harder for terrorists to exploit the internet to spread fear , violence and terror . This regulation will make it more difficult for terrorists to abuse the internet , to recruit online , to incite attacks online , to glorify their atrocities online . With this regulation , we take European action against terrorist activities online : action that is quick , cross—border and compulsory . Quick : Member States will be able to order internet providers to take down terrorist content within the hour . Cross-border : Member States will be able to issue orders to take down terrorist content hosted by any service provider anywhere in the European Union . Compulsory : providers must carry out these demands and pay fines if they don ’ t . Proportionate fines : small companies must not fall victim to terrorists abusing their systems . I ’ m sure you all remember the Christchurch attacks : 60 minutes and 55 seconds of mass murder broadcast live to the world . Some platforms still have copies of that attack online . What ’ s worse , animated versions aimed at children keep appearing on videogaming platforms . That too can soon be taken down in the whole of Europe within the hour . As we speak , jihadi groups are calling for attacks online : calling on followers to exploit political unrest during the pandemic , to kill people and damage property . That too , soon , can be taken down in the whole of Europe within the hour . With this regulation , we will strike a blow against terrorists . Without online manuals to tell you how , it ’ s harder to make bombs . Without flashy propaganda videos , it ’ s harder to poison the minds of young people . Without streaming attacks online , it ’ s harder to inspire copycat attacks . It ’ s difficult to measure : people are not radicalised , bombs not made , attacks not carried out . We may never be able to count how many , but this regulation will save lives , and we can be proud of this result . This regulation strikes a major blow against terrorists , but it ’ s only one of many steps in the fight against terrorism , offline and online . In December 2020 , I launched our counterterrorism agenda . Besides fighting terrorists online , we will , among other things , boost European police cooperation and information exchange , make it more difficult for foreign fighters to enter the European Union undetected , protect people in public spaces like churches , mosques , synagogues , stadiums and public transport . This regulation upholds our values and fundamental rights by fighting terrorists who attack our freedoms and our democracies , by putting safeguards in place , and by limiting removal of content to what is clearly illegal . We will take down terrorist content and uphold freedom of expression . I would like to warmly thank the rapporteur , Patryk Jaki , and also all the shadow rapporteurs for these results . A lot of work has gone into this . I would like to thank the Parliament for your support . Thank you for making this regulation a reality , and thank you for the very good cooperation . As a society , we are facing the enormous challenge of digital change , which fundamentally affects the way we live and the way we work . It affects our security and our privacy . We must face this challenge as law—makers and as a union . In December , the Commission launched the Digital Services Act to foster online markets and to protect fundamental rights online . We must also give law enforcement the right rules and tools to fight crime and terrorism in the digital age . It ’ s up to us now to find agreements on child sexual abuse online , our short—term and future long-term proposals on detecting and reporting child sexual exploitation online , and to find agreements on e—evidence – 85 % of evidence is electronic . To fight crime and terrorism , law enforcement needs timely access to cross—border evidence . To find agreement on data retention , we need to look at possibilities in line with EU law so that digital evidence of crimes or leads to investigations do not accidentally disappear . To find agreement on encryption , police must be able to gain effective access to encrypted electronic evidence when they are granted the legal authorisation to do so . To make agreements on artificial intelligence , law enforcement should use the full potential of AI to find missing children and very dangerous criminals , to prevent terrorist attacks and to respond to the malicious use of technology by criminals . All of these policies are as sensitive as they are important . The successful negotiating result achieved on this file – the terrorist content online – gives me the confidence that we will also find agreement on the Commission ’ s other proposals on digital law enforcement . So let this result inspire us together to make Europe safe for everyone . "

The matter, of course, deserves debate because, in addition to the clearest crimes, the line that separates freedom of expression from criminal conspiracy to destroy it must be clearly addressed. I have to tell you that I am very grateful to all the colleagues and, of course, to our rapporteur, the responsibility, because we look ahead and not in profile at the challenge. Because we have been responsible. Because they think that, if the terrorists who murder manage to hide behind the mask of freedom of expression, if they manage to make us believe that stopping them is a form of censorship, we will be digging our own grave. Solving the problems of citizens today is gaining security, not lowering our guard against violent fanatics, not giving in to fear. I assure you that I am satisfied, because the groups that were most belligerent in committee have not asked for the rejection of this agreement in plenary. The citizens would not forgive us if we acted irresponsibly. European citizens need us to minimize terrorist barbarity without losing their freedom. We have not let them down. We must not let them down in the future.'\n",
