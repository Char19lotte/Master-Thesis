      "Ms . WATERS . Mr. Speaker , I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill ( H.R . 2989 ) to amend securities and banking laws to make the information reported to financial regulatory agencies electronically searchable , to further enable the development of RegTech and Artificial Intelligence applications , to put the United States on a path towards building a comprehensive Standard Business Reporting program to ultimately harmonize and reduce the private sector 's regulatory compliance burden , while enhancing transparency and accountability , and for other purposes , as amended . General Leave Ms . WATERS . Mr. Speaker , I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon . The SPEAKER pro tempore . Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California ? There was no objection . Ms . WATERS . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of H.R . 2989 , the Financial Transparency Act of 2021 . As chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee , I would like to thank Representative Maloney for her leadership on this bill , as well as Representative McHenry , the ranking member of the committee , for working on this bill in a bipartisan manner . [ [ Page H5847 ] ] The Financial Transparency Act takes a proactive approach to modernizing our data standards and publication protocols within the financial services industry . This bill requires that the SEC , FDIC , OCC , CFPB , Federal Reserve , NCUA , and FHFA work with the Treasury Department to adopt data standards for the information it collects and to upgrade their reporting requirements so that reported data is stored in an open , searchable , and accessible manner . The bill also ensures that these standards are created in a coordinated manner to enable searchability across these agencies , helping to catch bad actors more easily while promoting greater transparency and trust from the public in our financial system . In this digital age , it is imperative that our regulators keep up with our rapidly changing financial markets and utilize technology in a way that safeguards our data while promoting the safety and soundness of our financial system . This bill puts the United States on equal footing with many other countries that already have begun using searchable data formats in submissions to regulators . This commonsense bill would also benefit retail investors , as they will be able to search through publicly available documents , rather than having to manually save each document in order to extract the information they want . In addition , companies that analyze this data will be able to more quickly report their findings to the public , helping better inform the investing public about the state of our capital markets . { time } 1715 H.R . 2989 will also benefit regulated entities , like banks , credit unions , asset managers , and public companies , as they will now have clearly delineated criteria and frameworks to upload their data , ensuring consistent data standards and the ability for financial institutions to do more efficient compliance tasks that must be performed manually today . For these reasons , I urge my colleagues to support this bill , and I reserve the balance of my time . Mrs. WAGNER . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of Representative Maloney and Ranking Member McHenry 's bipartisan legislation , H.R . 2989 , the Financial Transparency Act of 2021 . Our securities and banking laws require financial regulatory agencies to collect countless pieces of data from regulated entities each year . Yet , there is no consistency in the manner in which they collect this data . As a result , data is often difficult to find and to understand . This commonsense legislation ensures our regulatory agencies are working together to adopt consistent data fields and formats for the information they collect . The bill will require our banking and securities regulators to better organize data and make this information available in open-source formats . This , in turn , benefits investors , businesses , and even the Federal Government . Setting data standards will foster more transparency and increase the efficiency for everyone who generates , collects , and uses the information . This bill will make financial data more easily available . It will also reduce overhead costs and streamline workloads . I applaud Congresswoman Maloney and Ranking Member McHenry for their commitment to this issue . Reforming our information management practices and establishing uniform data standards for regulatory reporting is critical to ensuring an efficient and effective regulatory framework . I urge Members to support this commonsense piece of legislation and vote `` yes '' on H.R . 2989 , the Financial Transparency Act of 2021 . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Ms . WATERS . Mr. Speaker , I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York ( Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney ) , the sponsor of this legislation . Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York . Mr. Speaker , I thank the chair of the Financial Services Committee for her leadership and support on this legislation . Mr. Speaker , I rise today in strong support of H.R . 2989 , the Financial Transparency Act of 2021 , a bipartisan bill I introduced with Financial Services Committee Ranking Member McHenry . The Financial Transparency Act would require our Nation 's financial regulators to adopt a set of data collection and dispersion standards for the information they collect under current law , including the adoption of electronic forms to replace paper-based forms . All data would be made available in an open-source format that is electronically searchable , downloadable in bulk , and without license restrictions . Under the bill , Treasury is tasked with establishing common data standards that would allow the standardization and sharing of data across our financial regulators and the public at large . Such data standards would include a common legal entity identifier that would give Treasury an increased ability to provide effective oversight across our financial markets . The legal entity identifier is used throughout our financial markets and regulations today , and this bill would encourage agencies to continue moving in that direction . Each financial regulator is then tasked with adopting standards for the data reported to each agency . The regulators maintain the ability to tailor its regulations as needed to fit the unique needs of each entity and have the ability to scale any regulatory requirements in order to reduce regulatory burdens on smaller entities . I also want to be clear that this is not imposing new regulatory burdens on market participants . This is modernizing and making more transparent the data that is already reported to our regulators and that the regulators publish today . The bill also contains important protections to ensure confidential business [ [ Page H5848 ] ] and supervisory information remains protected . The end result of this bill will be more transparent and open data sources and data that is readily comparable across businesses and sectors . This is a win-win for regulators , for investors , for the public , for accuracy , and for industry . For regulators , they will more easily be able to analyze and search the data its regulated entities are reporting . This will improve efficiency and overall government operations . For investors , open-data publications will allow for easy searchability and comparability of companies and sectors , empowering investors to act on up-to-date information . Industries will be able to automatically report required information using software in the format required by their regulators . Mr. Speaker , the Financial Transparency Act builds on past congressional efforts to make data more accessible , useful , and more accurate . This has clear benefits for our regulators , investors , and market participants and would improve the ability of our regulators to monitor financial stability and therefore the safety and soundness of our financial markets . Before I close , I want to take a moment to thank Ranking Member McHenry and his staff for their work and coordination on this important effort . I also want to thank Chairwoman Waters and her staff for working with me on advancing this bill . This was truly a bipartisan effort , and we would not be here without everyone working in the same direction . Mr. Speaker , I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the Financial Transparency Act . Ms . WATERS . Mr. Speaker , I have no further speakers , and I am prepared to close . I reserve the balance of my time until Mrs. Wagner yields . Mrs. WAGNER . Mr. Speaker , I urge my colleagues to support H.R . 2989 , and I yield back the balance of my time . Ms . WATERS . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself the balance of my time to close . Mr. Speaker , I would again like to state that I support this bipartisan bill . The Financial Transparency Act of 2021 helps modernize our regulatory framework so that government , private industry , and the public all benefit . Now more than ever , it makes sense for Congress to harness technology in a manner that provides greater transparency , accountability , and efficiency , and this bill does exactly that . I want to thank Representative Maloney and Ranking Member McHenry for working with my staff in a bipartisan manner to get this bill across the finish line . Mr. Speaker , I yield back the balance of my time . Mr. McHENRY . Mr. Speaker , I rise in strong support of H.R . 2989 , the Financial Transparency Act of 2021 , introduced by my friend and colleague , Mrs. Maloney . I appreciate all her hard work on this important bill over the last six years to help make data more available to Americans and establish a framework to reduce regulatory compliance costs . We can all agree that data is important . In the 21st century , data is critical to growing our knowledge-based economy . Reliable data not only drives decisions in the private sector , but it also drives decisions within the federal government . Yet , data is only useful if one ( 1 ) can find it and ( 2 ) understand it . Trying to access data within the federal government , and in particular financial services sector , is even more difficult . Data is collected , maintained , and disclosed by the federal government in outdated formats . Moreover , the silos in the federal government and within the financial services industry can make it more difficult for Americans to access useful information . H.R . 2989 , the Financial Transparency Act of 2021 , brings the regulators and the financial industry into the 21st century . This bill will require our regulatory agencies to work together to establish data standards for regulatory reporting and to post the information online in a publicly accessible format . This bill applies to information the agencies already collect under current law . This bill signals Congress ' intent to have the information be unambiguously identified in machine-readable data formats . Automating how data is handled will make it easier for oversight agencies to quickly identify what needs further investigation , keeping small issues from becoming bigger ones , and allowing us to use government resources more wisely and efficiently . Automating how data is handled will allow regulated entities to automate much of their reporting processes . It is also important to note what this bill does not do . H.R . 2989 does not support any particular technology . Nothing needs to be invented to satisfy this bill . There are a range of technologies available that have been developed exactly for these needs in the US and globally . It does not change what gets reported . That is , it explicitly leaves to the agencies control over their disclosure requirements . Passage of the Financial Transparency Act is long overdue . I applaud my friend , Congresswoman Maloney , for her unwavering commitment to foster more transparency of the data collected by our federal government and increase the efficiency for everyone who generates , collects , and uses the information collected by our financial regulators . The SPEAKER pro tempore . The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from California ( Ms . Waters ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill , H.R . 2989 , as amended . The question was taken . The SPEAKER pro tempore . In the opinion of the Chair , two-thirds being in the affirmative , the ayes have it . Mr. WEBER of Texas . Mr. Speaker , on that I demand the yeas and nays . The SPEAKER pro tempore . Pursuant to section 3 ( s ) of House Resolution 8 , the yeas and nays are ordered . Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX , further proceedings on this motion are postponed . "
