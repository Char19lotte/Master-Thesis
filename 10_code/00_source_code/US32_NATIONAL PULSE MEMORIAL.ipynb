      "Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , pursuant to House Resolution 838 , I call up the bill ( S. 1605 ) to designate the National Pulse Memorial located at 1912 South Orange Avenue in Orlando , Florida , and for other purposes , and ask for its immediate consideration in the House . The Clerk read the title of the bill . The SPEAKER pro tempore . Pursuant to House Resolution 838 , an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of the Rules Committee Print 117-21 is adopted and the bill , as amended , is considered read . General Leave Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 1605 . The SPEAKER pro tempore . Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington ? There was no objection . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield myself 5 minutes . Madam Speaker , first of all , I want to thank all the people involved in this [ [ Page H7216 ] ] process . Certainly , the staff of the Armed Services Committee , our bipartisan staff , worked incredibly hard over the course of this year to put the bill together , first to get it through our committee process , off the floor and then in the negotiation process that has led to this final bill . I think it is an incredibly important process because it includes so many people . Throughout the House , throughout the Senate , Members who have concerns in a wide range of policy areas have the opportunity in this bill to have those concerns heard and to try to address them through legislation . When you add it all up , of all the different proposals that have come at us in the House and the Senate negotiating process , you are well north of a thousand different ideas that have been sent our way , and the staff sift through all of that , working with Members and their staffs as well , to try to come up with the best solutions . This is an unbelievably important process because it is representative democracy . It is the way our system is supposed to work , and this bill truly reflects that . It is a bipartisan , bicameral product that took into account every single opinion that it could , and I think we have produced an outstanding product . The number one thing that I want to make sure that people are aware of is how important the Armed Services Committee 's job of exercising oversight of the Department of Defense is and how important our job of making sure that the men and women who serve our country have everything they need to carry out the missions that we ask them to do . That is what our committee does . A whole lot of other issues get involved , but at its core , that is what we are focused on . In this bill there are hundreds of provisions to help make sure that gets done and gets done well . One of the major challenges our military faces right now is dealing with the rapid pace of technology . It is getting the Pentagon to better and more quickly adapt the innovative technologies that we need to meet our national security threats , and those threats are very real , as we are learning right now in real time , with what is going on between Russia and Ukraine , as we learn every day as we deal with an expansionist China , as we try to deal with Iran and North Korea and transnational terrorist groups . Those threats are real . Technology and innovation are crucial to meeting those threats , but we are moving too slowly at this point . There was a commission on artificial intelligence run by Eric Schmidt and Bob Work that put a whole series of recommendations together . Jim Langevin 's subcommittee worked on that . A number of proposals are in this bill to help them do a better job of handling that issue . We had a task force last year on supply chain concerns , which we have heard so much about . A number of key provisions from that task force are in this bill . That is what we do . Now , there are a lot of other issues , and it seems like when we get down to the end , we are always talking about the things we disagree about , which makes a certain amount of sense because , you know , you get through the stuff you can agree on , then you get down to the tougher stuff , and then you get down to the really tough stuff . But when we get down to that really tough stuff , I really hope that people do n't lose track of how important this piece of legislation is with the day in and day out work we do to support the national security and national defense of this country and to support the people who we ask to perform those tasks . This is an outstanding bill that needs to get passed . Now , it also happens that it is one of the few bills that consistently passes every year . Well , actually , it is the only bill that consistently gets passed every year , so we have a lot of issues from outside committees . I forget how many hundreds of proposals we had , but at the end of the day , the hundred-plus proposals that were in this bill we got 40 percent of them included in the final product , and we are happy to do that because it helps advance important issues in a wide variety of other areas . We ca n't carry them all because you have got to get bipartisan , bicameral agreement . So those of you who did n't get what you wanted out of this , please look at what is in the bill and how important it is . And the single most important thing in this bill , in my view , is we finally reformed our Uniform Code of Military Justice for how it deals with sexual assault . A stain on the military to this day is the fact that we have not adequately dealt with and protected the servicemembers who have faced sexual crimes in the military . This is the most transformational change that we have done on that issue . We take all sex crimes away from the commander , and we create a Special Victims Prosecutor who will have the expertise , the commitment , and the focus to adequately decide what crimes should be charged and to prosecute those crimes effectively . Now , a lot of people have worked on this . Nobody has done more than Jackie Speier . Jackie is responsible for getting this done and getting it to this point . Of all those people who worked on it , there were a lot of differences of opinion about how exactly to do it . And I know some folks think it should have been done slightly differently here , slightly differently there . This is the agreement that we can get done and get passed , and it is transformational in what it does . It is also , I believe , crucial to dealing with one of the other major issues that we face in the military , and that is diversity . The SPEAKER pro tempore . The time of the gentleman has expired . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield myself an additional 1 minute . The diversity problem that we have with recruitment , promotion , and how is the UCMJ carried out with regard to people of color . This bill will give us the opportunity to set up a whole set of crimes that are under a new authority to take a shot at fixing that problem . Now , I know some would like to add more crimes to that , and we had that debate . This is what we came up with , and it is huge . It is the biggest change we have had in a long time . It is worthy of our support . The entire bill is worthy of our support . The last thing I want to say is , I want to specifically thank Mr. Rogers of Alabama , the ranking member on this committee . The bipartisan , bicameral work that we do would not be possible without leadership on both sides . I could not ask for a better partner . His staff has been outstanding , as well as we have worked to get this product . I highly recommend this bill . Madam Speaker , I urge everyone to vote in favor of this bill , and I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . I rise in strong support of the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act . And I want to start off by saying Chairman Smith has been a real leader on this effort . He has had obstacle after obstacle thrown in his way for months and has continued to be a real advocate for the legislation , but also trying to make sure we get in a good place . And I could n't ask for a better partner to lead this committee with . The bill before us has strong bipartisan , bicameral support . Over the last year , we have seen the best of our soldiers , sailors , marines , airmen , and guardians . They have performed in the toughest environments with the greatest level of skill and professionalism . Many gave their lives so others would have a chance at a better life . Without a doubt , our military is the greatest force for good the world has ever seen . Providing the authorities and resources our servicemembers need to defend our Nation and defeat adversaries is the greatest responsibility we have here in Congress . We accomplish that responsibility with the bill before us today . It provides an additional $ 25 billion over the President 's request , reversing irresponsible cuts to procurement and readiness . This bill ensures our warfighters are the best equipped and trained in the world . It puts our servicemembers first , providing a 2.7 percent pay raise and expanding benefits to their families . It puts American workers first with historic investments in our industrial base . It also begins divesting in legacy systems that will not help us deter future [ [ Page H7217 ] ] threats . Instead , it invests in new technologies like artificial intelligence , hypersonics , and quantum computing that will help us stay ahead of our adversaries . That is important because Russia and China are rapidly modernizing their militaries . China is outpacing us with advancements in emerging technologies and weapons systems . In recent years , we have seen China use its military to push out its borders , threaten our allies , and gain footholds on new continents . This bill is laser focused on preparing our military to prevail in a conflict with China . It makes critical investments in new systems capable of surviving in contested environments . It includes provisions that will remove China from our defense supply chain . And it reaffirms our support to allies in the region , especially Taiwan . In Eastern Europe , Russia is on the march again . Putin is threatening NATO allies and amassing an invasion force on the Ukrainian border . This bill makes historic investments in the European Defense Initiative and provides $ 300 million for Ukraine , $ 75 million of which is lethal aid . Threats from near-peer rivals like China and Russia are not the only ones we face . Terrorists continue to plot to destroy our way of life , so we must continue to take the fight to them . With strong investments in new capabilities and readiness , this bill enables our warfighters to do just that . Finally , I think we were all horrified by the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan . This bill includes important provisions to provide accountability and ensure that we honor the 2,500 Americans who gave their lives in Afghanistan to keep our Nation safe . Again , Madam Speaker , this is a carefully drafted bipartisan , bicameral agreement . I urge all Members to support our servicemembers and their families by voting in favor of this bill . I reserve the balance of my time . { time } 2015 Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California ( Mr. Garamendi ) , the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness . Mr. GARAMENDI . Madam Speaker , the FY22 National Defense Authorization Act is a bipartisan project of enormous work both by members and staff . As always , I start by thanking Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers and the House Committee on Armed Services ' staff that worked long hours and many , many nights putting this year 's NDAA together . I also thank the Subcommittee on Readiness Ranking Member Lamborn , for his partnership on the subcommittee , as well as all the members of the subcommittee who contributed to the base bill or submitted amendments in the process . In addition , I thank the committee 's staff for their many hours of work in preparing this mark or this legislation . In particular , the staff of the Subcommittee on Readiness : Jeanine Womble , Ian Bennitt , Melanie Harris , David Sienicki , Jay Vallario , Wendell White , Whitney Verrett , and Naajidah Khan . I am particularly proud of the many priority issues for the Subcommittee on Readiness that are reflected in this final bill . Of note , this bill represents a continuation of the work to address the vulnerabilities of installations , as well as energy resiliency and response to climate change . We also are prioritizing efforts to address the contested logistics involving near-peer competitors . This bill strengthens the operation energy program by requiring the Department of Defense to create a working group to enhance integration of military department energy initiatives into operational planning and platform development to combat the many challenges associated with contested and congested logistics . It also represents a step forward in our work to ensure the safety of our military and civilian personnel is a top priority for the Department . The FY22 NDAA establishes the Joint Safety Council and requires the Department of Defense to develop a plan . The SPEAKER pro tempore . The time of the gentleman has expired . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds . Mr. GARAMENDI . The bill also takes important steps to improve the quality of family life dealing with housing and child development centers . Notably , $ 517 million in this bill for PFAS in an effort to increase transparency and provide information . Finally , the bill takes key steps to control the cost of expensive programs . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio ( Mr. Turner ) , who is not only the ranking member on Strategic Forces Subcommittee , but has spent years leading the effort for us to get to meaningful ways to deal with sexual assault in the military , which this bill does . Mr. TURNER . Madam Speaker , I thank the ranking member for yielding . Madam Speaker , I rise in support of the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act . I thank Chairman Smith , Ranking Member Rogers , and , of course , chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee , Jim Cooper , for once again delivering a National Defense Authorization Act in a bipartisan manner . This is , as the chairman was saying , the one time a year that we all come together , and that is counter to the narrative you see in Washington , that this truly is a bipartisan product . I thank the committee staff for continuing that culture . Madam Speaker , DOD leaders have made it clear that we must do more to deter adversaries . I am confident that this bill will do that in countering both Russia and China . As the ranking member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee , I am particularly proud of the progress this bill makes on the issues of nuclear modernization missile defense in space . Specifically , the bill fully funds our triad modernization program , to include the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent , the Long-Range Standoff Weapon , the B83 gravity bomb life extension , and the two-site solution for plutonium pit production in Los Alamos and the Savannah River Site . The bill prohibits the retirement or reconversion of the W76-2 low- yield warhead ; requires the integration of the LRSO air-launched cruise missile with the B-21 bomber ; and creates a floor of 400 U.S. ICBMs . On missile defense , it fully funds the Next Generation Interceptor and supports ensuring our homeland missile defense outpaces the North Korean ICBM threat . It also funds Guam and additional THAAD interceptors . On Space , we continue to push for declassification of programs that will help us counter China and Russia . Madam Speaker , I thank the ranking member for his comments and the chairman for the work in this bill that is done to try to deter and prevent sexual assault . Madam Speaker , this NDAA bolsters our national security . It improves the lives of our servicemembers , and will help us counter the threats of China and Russia . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut ( Mr. Courtney ) , chairman of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee . Mr. COURTNEY . Madam Speaker , I rise in strong support of the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act , which is before us this evening . As chair of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee , this bill is proof that our panel upheld its duty under Article 1 , Section 8 `` to provide and maintain a Navy . '' Our bill authorizes 13 new ships , continuing our tradition to independently scrub the budget and augment our Navy fleet responsibly . Within that total , we authorize three destroyers and two additional Fast Transport ships to support the rapid deployment of equipment and personnel . The agreement also reflects our panel 's ongoing efforts to recapitalize our aging sealift . The bill fully authorizes the new sealift Tanker Security Program , an initiative our panel started last year to meet gaps in our at-sea refueling capabilities . It also authorizes the fifth National Security Multi-Mission Vessel , another initiative our subcommittee led to boost maritime training and sealift capacity . Later this week , the historic Philly Shipyard will lay keel for the first in a series of NSMVs , which is tangible proof that our Nation can rebuild its decrepit sealift fleet with our [ [ Page H7218 ] ] domestic shipbuilding industrial base . To that end , this agreement rejects a request to further our reliance on used foreign-built sealift ships . Madam Speaker , of particular note , is the mark on undersea capabilities , which at the end of the day is the most effective path to deter the pacing threat of China . For proof of this , look no further than AUKUS , the recent security agreement between the U.S. , U.K. , and Australia , whose centerpiece is building a new fleet of Aussie nuclear- powered submarines . This NDAA funds two per year Virginia-class subs and full production of the Columbia program . It also includes House provisions of $ 200 million for a new facility , $ 130 million for supplier development , and $ 20 million for workforce development . Altogether , this will increase production capacity to help both our allies and our Navy to maintain dominance in the undersea domain . Madam Speaker , I thank Ranking Member Rob Wittman and all the members on the subcommittee for their great bipartisan work building the NDAA this year , as well as Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers . I also thank Phil McNaughton , Dave Sienicki , and Kelly Goggin for their great staff work , and Lieutenant Commander Matt Harmon , my Navy fellow , who is sadly leaving us soon . His really solid contribution as a SWO really was instrumental in terms of the work that our subcommittee was able to produce . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia ( Mr. Wittman ) . Mr. WITTMAN . Madam Speaker , I thank Mr. Rogers for yielding . Madam Speaker , our national security is in jeopardy . Russia literally has over 100,000 troops sitting on Ukraine 's doorstep . Iran continues to threaten the viability of Israel and other regional nations , and China is preparing to bully the ASEAN nations into submission and declare their regional hegemony , not just in Hong Kong but the entire region . Just this year , China surpassed the United States in battle force ships and is rapidly approaching parity in our combat aircraft . Do we have the courage to stand up to these regional tyrants ; do we oppose an Iranian regime who threatens to destabilize neighboring countries while they seek nuclear capabilities ; or even do we seek to appease a North Korea who continues to threaten South Korea and even the United States with their nuclear expansion ? Our Nation sits at the precipice of a national security inflection point . I know which path our Nation should select and I am emboldened to ensure our Nation is prepared to choose , at a time of our choosing , what will be in the best interest of our Nation . A strong national defense is necessary to preserve our democratic ideals and the nations who seek to live free from subjugation and oppression . Madam Speaker , that is why I am particularly pleased that we have rejected a multitude of national security objectives proposed by the Biden administration . This bill authorizes a 20 percent increase in ship construction , partially rejects an ill-advised `` divest to invest '' strategy , and blocks a multitude of poison pills that were haphazardly tacked on to this bill . I thank Ranking Member Rogers and his leadership during the top-line debate this year . We are adopting his authorization vision today , a vision that ensures real growth for defense . I also particularly thank Chairman Smith and Chairman Courtney for their approach to national security and their desire to reach a bipartisan consensus , doing what is in the best interest of our Nation . Madam Speaker , I say to my friends that this is a good bill , worthy of support . It sends a strong message to our democratic partners and allies that the United States stands with countries that oppose regional hegemony . We need to pass the National Defense Authorization Act to ensure our national security . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island ( Mr. Langevin ) , chair of the Subcommittee on Cyber , Innovative Technologies , and Information Systems . Mr. LANGEVIN . Madam Speaker , I thank the gentleman for yielding . Madam Speaker , I rise today in strong support of the National Defense Authorization Act . I begin by congratulating and thanking Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers , as well as my counterparts on the CITI Subcommittee , Ranking Member Banks and former Ranking Member Stefanik for their bipartisan collaboration in helping to craft a national defense bill for the 61st consecutive year . Thanks to the work of my subcommittee , this legislation includes a significant increase in early-stage research . Our research enterprise has always ensured our technology superiority . It is how we won the space race . Today , as the battlefield expands into cyberspace and outer space , we find ourselves facing a more aggressive Russia and China . I am proud that Congress has unlocked funds for hypersonics defense , directed energy , quantum computing , machine learning , and biotechnology so that we never send our war fighters into a fair fight . Madam Speaker , I am most proud that this bill includes many recommendations from the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence , including funds to accelerate the deployment of new technology to the war fighter . I am also proud that in our first year as a subcommittee , the Subcommittee on Cyber , Innovative Technologies , and Information Systems , we have made significant investments in our cybersecurity forces , set a course for improved cybersecurity governance within the Department , and continue to strengthen the Department of Homeland Security 's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency . The NDAA also fully funds key national security platforms , the Virginia-class and Columbia-class submarine programs . I thank the Rhode Islanders who build our Nation 's submarines and make our country safer . Finally , this bill funds installation resilience projects to address the ongoing threat from climate change . These achievements would not have been possible without the work of my subcommittee staff and personal staff . I thank Michael Hermann , Josh Stiefel , Troy Nienberg , Payson Ruhl , Caroline Goodson , and Juliann Hitt , and former staffers Bess Dopkeen and Caroline Kehrli . Madam Speaker , I urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan commitment to national security . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas ( Mr. Jackson ) , an outstanding freshman member of our committee . Mr. JACKSON . Madam Speaker , I rise in support of a critical piece of legislation that comes before Congress each year , the National Defense Authorization Act . First , I thank Ranking Member Rogers and his staff for their outstanding leadership in this effort . This bill modernizes our force , gives a well-deserved raise to our servicemembers , and provides them with the equipment they need to compete with China , Russia , and Iran . For the 13th District of Texas , this bill will protect the nuclear triad , it will modernize the Pantex Plant in Amarillo , and it will support training done at Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita Falls . It also included provisions that I authored to put servicemembers first and ensure the safety of all of our soldiers , sailors , airmen , marines , and guardians . This NDAA also pushes back on the unconstitutional vaccine mandate , and it holds the Biden administration accountable for its failed Afghanistan withdrawal . Just as important , there are some notable provisions that are not included . This bill does not contain harmful provisions that threaten the Second Amendment and it does not require our daughters to register for the draft . Bottom line : This bill is a win for the military , it is a win for the Texas 13th Congressional District , and it is a win for this country . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey ( Mr. Norcross ) , chair of the Tactical Air and Land Force Subcommittee . Mr. NORCROSS . Madam Speaker , I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers for their leadership in bringing this bill to the floor . This is our opportunity to pass the Defense Authorization Act for the 61st straight year . That is important . [ [ Page H7219 ] ] Madam Speaker , this bill continues the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee 's long tradition of bipartisan work to make America 's Armed Forces continue to be the best in the world . I commend the hard work by our members , certainly our staff , and everyone else in this rather unusual , complicated , and demanding year . { time } 2030 I especially want to thank Ranking Member Hartzler for her leadership and commitment to this bill . Our bipartisan cooperation in the House , once again , paid dividends in delivering a defense bill that meets the modernization and readiness needs of our Nation 's air and land forces . Madam Speaker , this bill carefully manages our military resources while increasing our congressional oversight of DOD 's large , complex , and expensive programs . Certainly , this is something that demands our attention and it certainly has . This billing includes significant compromises , many of which I personally do not agree with . This is a good bill , and it furthers America 's national security needs . Madam Speaker , I urge everyone to support this bill . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arkansas ( Mr. Crawford ) . Mr. CRAWFORD . Madam Speaker , I thank the gentleman from Alabama for his leadership . Madam Speaker , I rise today in support of the 2022 NDAA . This process began months ago . A bill was introduced , Members offered amendments , debated accordingly , and reached bicameral consensus . However , as Members arrived in Washington this afternoon , they realized they only had about 8 hours to review and vote on a 2,100-page document to secure our national defense -- a surprising and frustrating process that has become all too familiar with House Democrats and the majority . While I will always support our men and women in uniform , I am concerned that not all these men and women , specifically those who serve in the Army as explosive ordnance disposal technicians , as I once did , are adequately equipped to defend our Nation by this year 's version of NDAA . I will continue to work hard to achieve this purpose going forward . I am voting in favor of the legislation because of the critical funding it provides for our national defense , pay raises for our servicemen and -women , provisions to hold the Biden administration accountable on its irresponsible withdraw from Afghanistan , and serious steps to assess the involvement of the Chinese Communist Party in the origins of COVID-19 as well as their unacceptable and increasingly aggressive behavior around the world . I sincerely hope that next year we have more time to absorb the final provisions of the NDAA to make sure that all of our troops feel confident they have the full support of Congress . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona ( Mr. Gallego ) , the chair of the Intelligence and Special Operations Subcommittee . Mr. GALLEGO . Madam Speaker , I rise today in support of S. 1605 , the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 . I am proud that we in the House and Senate have completed our work on this defense bill and reached bipartisan consensus in support of our national security and our men and women in uniform . This year 's bill contains multiple provisions to address strategic challenges presented by China and Russia , to strengthen our ability to operate in the grey zone of conflict , and to deepen relationships with key allies and partners . As chair of the Intelligence and Special Operations Subcommittee , I am proud of the provisions of this bill that represent critical reforms to the defense intelligence enterprise , Special Operations Forces , and our ability to counter weapons of mass destruction . Our bill creates more agility across the defense intelligence enterprise by expanding information sharing with allies and partners and breaking down barriers to information sharing . This enhances our warfighters ' and combatant commanders ' ability to counter China and Russia in the information environment . The bill authorizes investments in emergent technologies for intelligence systems , including increasing funding for Project Maven , military information support operations , and the continued use of Small Business Innovation Research to develop AI-enabled data storage system solutions . Our bill authorizes a $ 105 million increase to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program , which will enhance our efforts to detect and fight emergent chemical and biological threats and develop medical countermeasures such as vaccines and therapeutics . It also establishes an office and organizational structure and provides authorities to address unidentified aerial phenomena . Finally , the bill strengthens alliances and partnerships with key countries in the Indo-Pacific , like South Korea and Taiwan , and in Europe . I am particularly proud that for the first time this bill recognizes the Baltic Security Initiative , which will provide robust support to Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania , and further strengthen deterrence in the region at a time of heightened tensions . I want to thank my subcommittee ranking member , Trent Kelly , for his contribution . I also want to thank the staff , Shannon Green , Jessica Carroll , Zachary Taylor , and Patrick Nevins , as well as my MLA , Michelle , for their tireless efforts . Madam Speaker , in addition to meeting the most pressing security challenges we face as a Nation today , this bill supports our servicemembers with a 2.7 percent pay raise , implements landmark UCMJ reforms , and combats extremism in the military . It is a good bill and I urge my colleagues to support it . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin ( Mr. Gallagher ) , the ranking member of the Military Personnel Subcommittee . Mr. GALLAGHER . Madam Speaker , I stand before you today in strong support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 . This year 's NDAA includes a top-line budget that restores funding for shipbuilding , procurement , missile defense , and a number of other priorities that will help ensure the national defense of our great Nation . The NDAA continues to support and improve the lives of those who sacrifice for our country on a daily basis by authorizing a military basic pay raise of 2.7 percent . The bill reinforces the committee 's longstanding commitment to the military family by requiring DOD to increase parental leave , expand the in-home childcare pilot program , it improves support available to military families with special needs children , and provides comprehensive reform of DOD 's family violence prevention and response program . It also requires the Department to standardize the definition of professional military education across the joint force . It requires DOD to report to Congress on the number of military personnel infected with COVID-19 at the 2019 World Military Games in Wuhan , China . It increases funding for COVID-19 vaccine research , while providing $ 35 million for research and treatment of Havana syndrome . Madam Speaker , this is an outstanding NDAA . I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for their tireless efforts in working together to preserve the bipartisan spirit of this committee . I also want to thank the chairwoman of the Military Personnel Subcommittee that I work with , Ms. Speier . Madam Speaker , this is a bill we can all be proud of . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California ( Ms. Speier ) , the chair of the Military Personnel Subcommittee . Ms. SPEIER . Madam Speaker , I thank our outstanding chairman . Madam Speaker , this helmet has been on my shelf in my office for 9 years . It has the signatures of 58 military servicemembers who have been sexually assaulted . It was a daily reminder to me that we had so much work to do . The clarion call of them , and so many others , hundreds of thousands of other servicemembers who have been sexually assaulted in the military has [ [ Page H7220 ] ] finally been heard . We can not erase their anguish , their pain , their abuse , their scarring , but we can , through this NDAA , change it for future servicemembers . Make no mistake , Madam Speaker , this is a seismic reform of the military justice system as it relates to sexual assault , as it relates to murder , as it relates to kidnapping . It is , in fact , creating a separate , distinct office which will be populated by those who are professional lawyers skilled in sexual assault , and investigators who will do the investigations . They will make the decisions as to whether or not these cases move forward . Beyond that , we make a crime of sexual harassment . We do n't go far enough because , unfortunately , it is still in the chain of command . Mind you , 100,000 servicemembers are sexually harassed every year . Sexual harassment begets sexual assault . We have more work to do there . Beyond that , in this particular measure we have a 2.7 percent increase for our servicemembers . We also provide up to 12 weeks of parental leave . Our version had a required opportunity for 12 weeks , but that was changed , and , hopefully , we will move on that in the future . We are improving childcare centers that are failing . We have required an independent review commission to look at suicides within the military . The SPEAKER pro tempore . The time of the gentlewoman has expired . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from California . Ms. SPEIER . Madam Speaker , we have now required racial and gender data collection for NJP . We also are providing better access to mental health . In the end , when servicemembers serve so do their families . This bill delivers on our commitment to them and to the military families . It also honors the memory of Specialist Guillen and others like her who have been killed , as well as the tens of thousands of survivors living with the scars of sexual assault . Madam Speaker , I thank Josh Connolly , my chief of staff ; Brian Collins ; Chuck Jackson , my fellow . I also thank the committee staff , Ilka Regino , Hannah Kaufman , Dave Giachetti , Ranking Member Mike Gallagher , and a special thanks to Chairman Adam Smith , who has worked so closely with me in making sure we got to this point . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California ( Mr. Garcia ) . Mr. GARCIA of California . Madam Speaker , I want to commend both sides of the aisle for a rather strong National Defense Authorization Act and commend the gentleman from Alabama ( Mr. Rogers ) for his revisions . Madam Speaker , it is a good top-line NDAA , it makes the strategic and tactical level investments necessary to catch up and keep pace with China . A lot of this technology that we are investing in is developed , built , and tested in my district , the 25th Congressional District . This removes red flag provisions . It allows for those who do n't want to get vaccinated to be separated from the service with an honorable discharge . Clearly , I support this bill and it is an excellent NDAA . I do think we need to do better when it comes to our troops ' base pay . Some may tout the 2.7 percent pay increase . I see it as anemic , frankly , and it is actually aggravating the pay gap between military servicemembers and their civilian counterparts . With record inflation , our troops , especially the junior enlisted , continue to be hammered financially . If we want to deter threats and win wars in the modern battlefield , which we have to , we need to attract and retain more talent . If we want to end things like conscription , and we should , we need to better incentivize our enlisted ranks to join and stay in . I urge support . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas ( Mr. Fallon ) . Mr. FALLON . Madam Speaker , I want to take a minute to thank Ranking Member Rogers for his tremendous leadership . Madam Speaker , I rise today in strong support of the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act . Not only does this bill authorize the necessary investments to maintain our global competitiveness in the face of increasing Chinese and Russian aggression , but it takes critical steps to protect our men and women in uniform . In particular , this bill authorizes almost $ 200 million in lifesaving technology to prevent Humvee rollovers . I am honored to represent Red River Army Depot where a significant portion of this work will be done . The investment will save the American taxpayers $ 12.8 billion compared to the Army 's original plan , and it will save countless lives . Madam Speaker , I thank the ranking member and all of our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for their work on this , and I urge final passage of this bill . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida ( Mrs. Cammack ) . Mrs. CAMMACK . Madam Speaker , I thank the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee and all of my colleagues for bringing us to this point here today . Madam Speaker , I rise in support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 . I want to sincerely thank every single member who worked in a productive , constructive , and helpful manner to get us to this finish line . Funding our military , taking care of our troops , and providing for the common defense is , in fact , our duty . Promises made , promises kept . We did what we said we were going to do . No dishonorable discharges for servicemembers who refuse the vaccine , and it is retroactive . No unconstitutional red flag laws . We killed and buried the dangerous office of domestic extremism . This bill counters China , gets them out of our supply chain , and holds this administration accountable on Afghanistan . This bill is a win for our military , our communities , our national guard , for our country . It is time to stop talking about getting Americans out of Afghanistan . It is time to stop talking about securing the border . It is time to stop talking about holding China accountable . It is time for action . This bill does all that and more . Madam Speaker , I urge my colleagues to vote `` yes . '' Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado ( Mr. Lamborn ) . Mr. LAMBORN . Madam Speaker , I rise in support of S. 1605 , the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act . I commend our chairman and ranking member for negotiating a strong bipartisan bill , which provides our troops with the resources they need to accomplish the missions they are given . I thank my partner and chairman on the Readiness Subcommittee , John Garamendi , for his leadership and hard work in crafting legislation that we can all support . I thank my committee staff , Ian Bennitt , Dave Sienicki , Whitney Verett , and Kyle Noyes , and my Space Force Fellow -- first time in congressional history -- Chris Brown , for all of their exemplary professionalism . { time } 2045 This legislation could not come at a more opportune time . As we speak , Russia is amassing troops on the border of Ukraine , and China continues to rapidly modernize their strategic capabilities , including hypersonic drive vehicles , with their eyes on Taiwan . This legislation is not perfect , but what it does do is ramp up procurement of vital weapons systems , support our combatant commands , restore spending to essential readiness accounts , and continue modernizing our strategic capabilities in the space and nuclear domains . Importantly , it also provides some protections , partly through my amendment , for those troops who do not take the COVID-19 vaccine and requires DOD to consider natural immunity as part of their exemption policy . We also removed troubling red-flag language and the requirement for women to register for Selective Service . [ [ Page H7221 ] ] Madam Speaker , this is a good bill . I am happy to support this legislation , and I urge my colleagues to vote `` yes . '' Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I am prepared to close at this point if the gentleman is . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield myself the balance of my time . Madam Speaker , I want to again thank Chairman Smith , Chairman Reed , Ranking Member Inhofe , and all the members of HASC and SASC for their tremendous work this year . I also want to thank our committee staff on both sides of the aisle , as well as staff from leadership , legislative counsel , and CBO , for their hard work and dedication . Enormous numbers of hours were put into this endeavor over the course of this year , and I ca n't overstate how much I appreciate the staff work . Finally , Madam Speaker , today is the day we honor the brave 3,500 American servicemembers killed or wounded in Pearl Harbor . On that day and again on September 11 , our Nation came together and vowed to defend our homeland and protect our freedom from all enemies . Each year , Congress comes together in an effort to fulfill that vow by passing the National Defense Authorization Act . Madam Speaker , I urge all Members to do that again this year and pass the NDAA , and I yield back the balance of my time . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield myself the balance of my time . Madam Speaker , I want to begin at an odd place . I do n't want to discourage people from voting for this bill , but on the vaccine mandate issue , I want to make very clear that I heard a lot of things that were supposed to be done in this bill ; none of that was done in the bill . We do n't have anything in the bill which tells the military what they can or can not do in terms of punishing people for refusing to meet the vaccine mandate , as a starting point . We certainly do n't have anything in the bill that says natural immunity can count . We do have language in the bill that says that the military should take a look at how the vaccine mandate could be -- sorry . It is not in the bill ; it is in bill language , which is a different thing . It says you can look at how the vaccine mandate is affecting recruitment and retention , and that is fine . But all that other stuff , Madam Speaker , for those of you who are listening and thinking I may have lost my mind , I have not . We did not support that and did not do that . That minor point aside , this is an outstanding piece of legislation that is truly bipartisan . There are a lot of small , little things here and there . But , again , the big picture is everything we do in this bill and everything that you heard , Madam Speaker , from primarily the chairs and ranking members of our subcommittee , an exhaustive list of all the provisions that are so important in making sure that we meet our obligations on national security , defense , and supporting the men and women who serve . It is a ton of work to figure out those policies , and it has never been , in my view , more important during my time in Congress . As we have heard , we have these threats that are out there . They are real and as complex as they have ever been . Then also , we have the rapid pace of technology and innovation that is changing what is necessary to provide adequate deterrence and to provide adequate defense on a minute-to-minute basis . The most crucial thing in our ability to meet our national security objectives is : How quickly are we going to innovate ? How quickly are we going to adapt ? We are not innovating and adapting quickly enough right now , and there are a whole bunch of provisions in this bill to help push the Pentagon in the correct direction , to help make sure we give them the help they need or , in some cases , the push they need to adopt the technology that is going to move us in a better direction . We also have a lot in this bill to help improve competition and to deal with some of the very painful cost overruns that we have seen on programs like the KC-46 tanker , programs like the F-35 , and a whole series of other issues . We introduce competition , and we introduce ways to make sure that we take advantage of technology because every time I see a cost overrun -- and the Speaker is uniquely positioned to understand this . Again , we have these terrible cost overruns we hear about , and we always hear : Oh , well , it is a software problem . Well , yes , it is like a multibillion-dollar software problem . So why do n't we fix those software problems and save us a lot of money ? This bill pushes us more in the direction of getting after those problems than any bill that I have worked on . It is an incredibly important piece of legislation that moves us forward in a positive direction . Yes , we are also able to carry a few issues that were not in our jurisdiction . In fact , Madam Speaker , with the permission of everyone , the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee has arrived and was going to speak . Madam Speaker , if I could yield to him just 1 minute or 2 to talk about the Committee on Foreign Affairs because the committee reauthorized a provision that is contained in this bill as well . I want to make sure the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee has at least a couple of minutes . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes of my remaining time to the gentleman from New York ( Mr. Meeks ) to talk about the Foreign Affairs provision , and then I will close when he is done . Mr. MEEKS . Madam Speaker , I want to thank the distinguished chair of the House Armed Services Committee for all of his hard work in putting together , as he was just closing , what I think is a bill that is one of the best -- a lot of hard work that he has done . I thank the ranking member also . Madam Speaker , I rise today to speak in favor of passing this measure here before us today . Every year for the past six decades , Congress has passed a Defense authorization bill . This is an important bipartisan tradition , and I commend , as I said , Chairman Smith for his admirable work carrying out this legacy . Unfortunately , Congress has been asleep at the wheel when it comes to our State Department . We have not passed a comprehensive State Department authorization in nearly two decades . Congress has been attuned to defense for decades , but we have consistently left diplomacy out to dry . I am glad that tonight we will be ending this trend by passing out both a Defense authorization bill and a bipartisan State authorization bill contained therein . We need a State Department for the century ahead , not decades past , and my State authorization bill will now put us on that track . Now , no bill is perfect . Unfortunately , I am disappointed that there are some provisions that were not included in this NDAA . Saudi Arabia 's abuse against dissidents and civil society has continued since the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi , yet two bipartisan House provisions that addressed some of these human rights violations were dropped in the final package . Other amendments that would have ended needless civilian casualties resulting from the brutal war in Yemen were also removed by Senate Republicans , though we had a bipartisan agreement in this House . The SPEAKER pro tempore . The time of the gentleman has expired . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from New York . Mr. MEEKS . Finally , Madam Speaker , provisions promoting diversity and other management reforms at the State Department were also left out . These are just a few examples of where the bill falls a little short . Despite the efforts of many of our members of the Foreign Affairs Committee , and my own as chair , we were unable to secure the requisite support from Senate Republicans to advance important provisions in this final bill . Nevertheless , Madam Speaker , there are other important provisions contained in this NDAA , including State authorization , and I urge my colleagues to vote in the affirmative . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I want to start by thanking the staff for the outstanding job that they do . As I have always said , Members have constituents coming at us on a variety of different issues . We come up with ideas and say we ought to do this . And from that , that idea actually has to be written down and has to get approval . It is the staff that does all [ [ Page H7222 ] ] that tireless work to make sure that we get the final product that is in front of us . I really , really want to thank the staff . I want to emphasize the fact that our staff on the Armed Services Committee is a bipartisan staff . It is the only committee in Congress that does that . Whether we are in charge or the Republicans are in charge , the staff is bipartisan , and I think that is incredibly important in getting the work done in the way that we do , working together to produce this product . This is a product every single Member of this body can be proud of , and it is a product I think every single Member of this body should vote for . Madam Speaker , I urge passage , and I yield back the balance of my time . Mr. McHENRY . Madam Speaker , I rise in support of S. 1605 , the National Defense Authorization Act ( NDAA ) for fiscal year 2022 . Debt Bondage is a terrible crime , and many victims find themselves trapped in a perpetual cycle of forced labor and coerced debt because of it . Helping these survivors regain their livelihood is a nonpartisan issue . Earlier this year , the Financial Services Committee held a hearing on the financing of human trafficking . We heard from powerful witnesses , including Reverend Doctor Marian Hatcher , who is a trafficking survivor . It was her story , which inspired my original bill H.R . 2332 , the Debt Bondage Repair Act . Dr. Hatcher , like too many in this country , fell victim to human traffickers . Thankfully , she was able to escape a terrible situation and restore her life . However , she struggled to reestablish herself because of her credit score , which was negatively affected by loans she was forced to obtain her traffickers . Madam Speaker , this is how these criminals trap an individual into a cycle of victimization . Traffickers will take out loans , open businesses , and destroy their victim 's credit , which forces them to remain a victim until they pay off the debt . Too often , these victims are never able to get out . Section 6102 in the final text has the potential to help thousands of victims every year by ensuring that a consumer reporting agency may not furnish a credit report with adverse information from a severe form of trafficking . While this does not erase the terrible crimes committed against them , it will help survivors to regain their financial freedom and begin to rebuild their lives . I will conclude by thanking Chairwoman Waters for passing my bill H.R . 2332 on suspension earlier this Congress , and for including my provision in the House NDAA base text . Additionally , I would like to thank the numerous trafficking advocacy groups and the Consumer Data Industry Association for their work on H.R . 2332 . I urge my colleagues to support the conference agreement . The SPEAKER pro tempore . All time for debate has expired . Pursuant to House Resolution 838 , the previous question is ordered on the bill , as amended . The question is on the third reading of the bill . The bill was ordered to be read a third time , and was read the third time . The SPEAKER pro tempore . The question is on the passage of the bill . The question was taken ; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , on that I demand the yeas and nays . The SPEAKER pro tempore . Pursuant to section 3 ( s ) of House Resolution 8 , the yeas and nays are ordered . Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX , further proceedings on this question are postponed . "
