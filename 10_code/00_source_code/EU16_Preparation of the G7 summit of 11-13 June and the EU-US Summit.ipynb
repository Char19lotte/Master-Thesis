      "Ana Paula Zacarias , President-in-Office of the Council . – Madam President , thank you for this opportunity to discuss in a bit more detail these two important upcoming summits , to which President Michel and President von der Leyen have already referred . First , on the G7 summit , which the UK will host in Cornwall this weekend , as President Charles Michel has just underlined , the overall mission of the EU for the meeting is clear : to support an agenda for global action built on a strong commitment to international cooperation , multilateralism and an open , resilient , rules-based international order . Here there are a couple of elements . First , the COVID—19 pandemic needs global cooperation in order to be overcome . We need solidarity . We need to ensure early access to vaccines and treatments everywhere . While vaccination campaigns are making progress around the world , more needs to be done . President von der Leyen explained clearly what we are doing in terms of exports , donating vaccines , and supporting the production of vaccines , but more needs to be done . We need a stronger multilateral response . We call for closing the financial gap for access to the COVID—19 Tools Accelerator , and we have been the main supporters of COVAX , but we can not be multilateralists alone . All the advanced G7 economies should share doses through COVAX . Secondly , solidarity also remains key in dealing with the economic effects of the pandemic , as we expect uneven recoveries and deepening of inequalities . We need to work together to fight hunger and poverty around the world . In this respect , a new general allocation of special drawing rights , unprecedented in terms of size , is under preparation by the IMF . EU Member States have supported this initiative and are discussing how best to channel these resources to the most vulnerable countries . Thirdly , we also need to better prepare the world for the next pandemic . A number of initiatives are ongoing with the recent Rome Declaration of Principles released by the Global Health Summit and discussed at WHO , including on an international treaty on pandemics . This should not be a missed opportunity . Furthermore , the UK G7 Presidency has put forward a very ambitious agenda on climate and biodiversity against the background of the two important events of this year , the COP26 on climate and the COP15 on biodiversity . Success at the COP26 will depend on the level of ambition of all parties . The EU has already submitted its ambitious nationally determined contribution ( NDC ) . It will be important that the G7 shows an equally strong level of ambition and leadership , with clear commitments . The EU is also committed to working with the G7 partners to adopt new , ambitious global targets on biodiversity for the COP15 . Our own EU 2030 biodiversity strategy is a testimony to that . Finally , another very important topic regards international taxation . We are at a crucial juncture on the OECD—led negotiation for a broader overhaul of the rules on international taxation of the largest multinational enterprises . We welcome the fact that the G7 has reached a consensus on the framework for an overall agreement , and we hope that this agreement at G7 level will indeed form a good basis for further work , both within the G20 and at the level of the OECD . Turning now to the upcoming summit with the United States , I would like to stress the symbolic importance of this event . It will take place as a part of President Biden ’ s first foreign trip , seven years after the previous summit , upon an invitation by President Charles Michel . The United States and the EU represent 780 million people who share democratic values . It is also the largest economic relationship in the world . We have a chance and a responsibility to help people make a living , keep them safe , fight climate change and stand up for democracy and human rights . We would like to see this summit agree with the US on an ambitious cooperation agenda in four key areas : fighting the COVID pandemic and driving forward a sustainable global recovery ; second , protecting our planet and fostering green growth ; third , strengthening trade , investment and technological cooperation ; and fourth , building a more democratic , peaceful and secure world . We expect that leaders will agree on a very concrete and ambitious set of deliverables in all these four areas and we believe that this event has the potential to be a key milestone in renewing and re—energising our partnership . A strong transatlantic partnership is vital to ensure , and to contribute to , our common security , stability and prosperity . A renewed transatlantic agenda is necessary to find joint answers to global challenges and make it deliver for our citizens . We hope that the summit will not be a one—off event and that regular exchanges between the EU and the United States will resume at different levels . Discussions in preparation for the summit are under way , both with EU Member States and on the US side , and I am sure that today ’ s exchange will provide a timely and important input into the summit preparations . I ’ m very keen to listen to your views . Thank you very much for your attention . "

This should not be a missed opportunity. Furthermore, the UK G7 Presidency has put forward a very ambitious agenda on climate and biodiversity against the background of the two important events of this year, the COP26 on climate and the COP15 on biodiversity. Success at the COP26 will depend on the level of ambition of all parties. The EU has already submitted its ambitious nationally determined contribution (NDC). It will be important that the G7 shows an equally strong level of ambition and leadership, with clear commitments. The EU is also committed to working with the G7 partners to adopt new, ambitious global targets on biodiversity for the COP15. Our own EU 2030 biodiversity strategy is a testimony to that. Finally, another very important topic regards international taxation. We are at a crucial juncture on the OECD—led negotiation for a broader overhaul of the rules on international taxation of the largest multinational enterprises. We welcome the fact that the G7 has reached a consensus on the framework for an overall agreement, and we hope that this agreement at G7 level will indeed form a good basis for further work, both within the G20 and at the level of the OECD. Turning now to the upcoming summit with the United States, I would like to stress the symbolic importance of this event. It will take place as a part of President Biden’s first foreign trip, seven years after the previous summit, upon an invitation by President Charles Michel. The United States and the EU represent 780 million people who share democratic values. It is also the largest economic relationship in the world. We have a chance and a responsibility to help people make a living, keep them safe, fight climate change and stand up for democracy and human rights. We would like to see this summit agree with the US on an ambitious cooperation agenda in four key areas: fighting the COVID pandemic and driving forward a sustainable global recovery; second, protecting our planet and fostering green growth; third, strengthening trade, investment and technological cooperation; and fourth, building a more democratic, peaceful and secure world. We expect that leaders will agree on a very concrete and ambitious set of deliverables in all these four areas and we believe that this event has the potential to be a key milestone in renewing and re—energising our partnership.

      "Valdis Dombrovskis , Executive Vice-President of the Commission . – Madam President , the transatlantic relationship is a beacon of democracy and prosperity . We share deep historical ties , as well as the biggest trade and investment relationship in the world . Our trade flows reached a value of almost EUR one trillion . But our partnership goes beyond economics . We have shared values , and we are committed to supporting democracy across the world . We share a fundamental belief in strong global rules and institutions that give every country a fair chance to flourish . When the EU and US speak with one voice , we can get things done . Today , after some years of turbulence , the atmosphere has changed for the better . We are looking for new avenues for joint leadership : ending the COVID-19 pandemic and driving the economic recovery ; building a more democratic , peaceful and secure world ; World Trade Organization reform ; climate and green growth ; trade and technology ; levelling the global level playing field . Back last December , the EU reached out to the incoming Biden administration with a proposal for a renewed transatlantic agenda . The Commission welcomes the European Parliament ’ s support for this approach . We are engaging intensively with our American counterparts to translate our intentions into action . I have had very constructive conversations with US Trade Representative Ambassador Tai and Secretary of Commerce Raimondo in this regard . We now have two important opportunities to advance our strategy : a G7 summit in the UK next week and the EU-US summit on 15 June . Let me start with the G7 summit . The participation of President Biden and the new US administration , together with the parallel Italian G20 Presidency , offers an excellent opportunity to reinvigorate the G7 . The EU will be calling for stronger multilateral cooperation , in particular on health , climate , the economic recovery , and bolstering our common values as open societies and democracies . Our key priorities for this year ’ s G7 summit focus on beating the pandemic , recovering from the crisis while building a better future , strengthening the multilateral trading system , working for a successful COP 26 , and joining forces for a human-centric digital transformation . Let me briefly address each of our priorities . On health , while overcoming the COVID pandemic is our immediate priority , we should also enhance our preparedness for possible future pandemics . Good progress was made at the G20 Global Health Summit co-hosted by Italy and the European Commission in May . The EU demonstrated its full commitment to global solidarity . We want to build on this progress and agree on a G7 Health Declaration . The EU will push for more ambitious commitments to share vaccines with developing countries , and financing the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator . We are also fully committed to supporting the development of vaccine manufacturing capacity in developing countries , and we are driving this work forward via forums like the WTO . On the economic recovery , we have provided unprecedented support to citizens and businesses to mitigate the impact of the pandemic . Given the magnitude of the COVID-19 crisis ’ s economic impact , this support has proven very successful . At the G7 summit , we will insist that economic support should not be abandoned too early , but should still be maintained to allow the recovery to gain proper ground . But we will equally insist that in order to build a better future , we should shift from crisis response to promoting strong , resilient , sustainable , balanced and inclusive growth . Trade will play a major role . We all agree that the multilateral trading system needs to be reformed , and I thank the honourable Members for their consistent leadership in this respect . The G7 has a responsibility to lead the reform effort , and the EU will be proactively calling for this strong approach . When it comes to the digital arena , our aim at the G7 summit will be to show unity between like-minded partners . We want to send a clear message that we are ready to cooperate and shape a digital future based on our shared democratic values . G7 trade ministers have already expressed strong support for open digital markets and opposition to digital protectionism – in line with the EU ’ s own approach . We strongly support the creation of new rules for digital trade at the World Trade Organization . We are committed to advancing the joint statement initiative on e-commerce . Leading on environment and climate action is the EU ’ s first priority . At the G7 , we will continue pushing for ambitious COP 26 commitments on climate change and for ambitious COP 15 commitments on biodiversity . At the summit , the G7 will show strong leadership by signing up for an unprecedented joint commitment concerning net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest . Finally , the G7 summit will provide an opportunity to promote our democratic values and open society around the world , notably by endorsing a joint declaration with like-minded democracies : the Republic of Korea , India , Australia and South Africa . We want to engage with our international partners on geopolitical challenges , including the latest developments in Russia and Belarus . We will continue to call for the immediate and unconditional release of Belarusian journalist Raman Pratasevich . Now moving on to next Tuesday ’ s EU-US summit . We very much welcome the Biden administration ’ s re-engagement on the global stage and its commitment to reinvigorating the traditional alliance with Europe . The summit will be an opportunity to show the world that we are serious about tackling global challenges together . We will commit to upholding democracy and human rights , to ending the pandemic and addressing global health in general . We will also commit to protecting our planet and supporting an economic recovery that benefits everyone . We also hope that the summit can deliver a more positive trade agenda . We will commit to collectively addressing the challenges stemming from non-market economies . And , as a trust and confidence-building measure , we have to de-escalate and solve EU-US trade disputes . We want to make decisive progress in resolving our bilateral disputes on aircraft and the US Section 232 measures on steel and aluminium . On the latter , we sent a clear signal to the US of our willingness to solve this issue in a fair and balanced way , by suspending the automatic doubling of our legitimate countermeasures . It is now for the US to walk the talk . Beyond immediate priorities , the EU and US should move closer when it comes to defining technologies , green and digital economies and societies of the future . To that end , the EU has proposed establishing a Trade and Technology Council to deliver transatlantic leadership in the area of trade and digital , based on our shared values . Of course , this cooperation should also be open to like-minded partners . Last but not least , we also hope to forge an alliance with the US to cooperate on World Trade Organization reform . We need to bring the global trade rulebook up to date , helping us to address the many challenges we face . Finally , we will engage with the US on critical geopolitical challenges , including Russia and China , but also in supporting the EU ’ s eastern partners such as Ukraine , Georgia and Moldova , strengthening our joint engagement in the Western Balkans , and ensuring stability in the Middle East and Africa . To conclude , the Commission is looking forward to these important summits and we will inform you of their outcome . "

Third , I would like to make an appeal : G7 Heads of State and Government must step up their support for COVAX . We talked today about the European COVAX initiative . It is currently the main instrument of solidarity to fight the COVID-19 pandemic all over the world and it is important to support COVAX not only with declarations , not only with the wish to act better at the international level , even populist declarations . , but also to contribute concretely to support COVAX . Finally , it is refreshing to see that the United States is back on the international scene with a constructive approach . We must remain united between democracies at the international level .

It is currently the main instrument of solidarity to fight the COVID-19 pandemic all over the world and it is important to support COVAX not only with declarations, not only with the wish to act better at the international level, even populist declarations. , but also to contribute concretely to support COVAX. Finally, it is refreshing to see that the United States is back on the international scene with a constructive approach. We must remain united between democracies at the international level. More and more authoritarian leaders are openly challenging the democratic system and we must respond to them with courage and firmness.'\n",

Today, the G7 has to change course drastically as we no longer live in a world in which liberal democracy is evident. Instead of being a loose club of wealthy nations, the G7 urgently needs to become an active alliance of genuine democracies – a solid alliance ready to fight authoritarian crooks like Lukashenko with a worldwide sanctions regime, to cease doing business with countries or in products produced by slave labour or on the back of our planet, and to radically rethink our military alliances and strategies. Even for the new Biden administration, a European army and a UN defence unit are no longer taboo. Let us show courage, ambition and vision in this G7. Let’s go forward with a new concept for a G7 in defence of our values and our freedoms – a G7 willing to fight for it.'\n",
