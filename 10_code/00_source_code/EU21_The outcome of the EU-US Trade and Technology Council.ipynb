      "Valdis Dombrovskis , Executive Vice-President of the European Commission . – Mr President , honourable Members , before going to the Trade and Technology Council itself , let me first zoom out and outline why the year 2021 has been a landmark year for transatlantic relations . We have successfully pressed the reset button with the Biden administration . After the grounding of the Airbus—Boeing dispute at the EU—US summit in June , we also agreed to hit the pause button on the steel and aluminium trade dispute . Our agreement includes starting discussions on the new global arrangement on sustainable steel and aluminium . Of course , we remain attentive and active on a number of US policy developments that may affect EU interests . Those could be the increase of the US domestic content via the reinforcement of ‘ Buy American ’ or the use of tax incentives , for example for the purchase of electrical vehicles . But overall , it is clear that our trade and investment partnership remains a global engine of prosperity . Beyond resolving our trade disputes , we must create space to find new avenues of cooperation and deal with the challenges and opportunities of the future . In this respect , the first meeting of the Trade and Technology Council ( TTC ) at the end of September represented an important step in the right direction , as well as an important political signal . We are ready to lead the way in setting the standards and rules for the technologies of the 21st century , putting our core values at the centre . We are addressing environmental challenges and market opportunities for clean technology , and we are ensuring more resilient and secure supply chains , in particular in semiconductors , pharmaceuticals and critical materials for our economies . The trade component of the TTC is of particular importance , and we have determined shared principles and areas for export control cooperation , especially on dual—use technologies . We also agreed to cooperate on best practices in investment screening , for example , on risk analysis and risk mitigation , in relation to sensitive technologies . There will be a special focus on SMEs and on policies that can accelerate their uptake of digital technologies . We will work together on global trade challenges like non—market economic policies and practices , the protection of labour rights such as combating forced and child labour , and addressing trade—related aspects of climate and environmental action will also be part of our work . Finally , we aim at avoiding unnecessary barriers to trade in new technologies while respecting our regulatory autonomy . We have thus set in motion a whole range of work strands that we will now pursue with vigour . To ensure concrete progress , we will meet regularly at principals ’ level . The next meeting is scheduled for spring 2022 in the EU . There is strong willingness on both sides of the Atlantic to make our cooperation in the TTC a success . We are counting on your support for this . Members of the European Parliament , but also national governments , are essential in raising awareness around the fact that the benefits we gain from transatlantic cooperation will also require some compromises . We are committed to providing the European Parliament with information on the work of the TTC and we are committed to a transparent and inclusive engagement with key stakeholders and civil society at large . Stakeholder engagement also figured prominently in the first TTC meeting . Last month , the Commission also opened a One—Stop Shop to collect continuous stakeholder input on the platform called Futurium . I strongly encourage you to promote this point of contact among your constituencies and stakeholders . We also encourage stakeholders on both sides of the Atlantic to join forces and , wherever possible , work together to shape joint transatlantic positions .

      "Margrethe Vestager , Executive Vice-President of the Commission . – Mr President , honourable Members , thank you very much for the invitation to come here with Valdis to have this exchange and to debrief you on the first meeting of the Trade and Technology Council ( TTC ) . Our digital partnership with the US plays an important role in enabling us to deliver on what we have set up for this digital decade . We have an opportunity to set a vision for a democratic and human-centred digital transformation , both at home and obviously also around the world . And following the successful first meeting in Pittsburgh on 29 September , I think it is clear that the TTC has a huge potential . We spent one and a half days together with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken , US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and US Trade Representative Katherine Tai . We had positive , frank , direct discussions . We do not always agree on every topic , but I think that shows that we are not just a talking shop : we aim for concrete deliverables for making progress on the issues at stake . Now the TTC will focus on the actions identified in the joint statements , where the 10 working groups have been given specific tasks . Valdis has taken you through a number of these very important points . So let me just briefly touch upon three areas of particular importance when it comes to the technology side of the Trade and Technology Council . First , on artificial intelligence , we agreed in Pittsburgh to develop trustworthy AI to oppose the use of AI that violates fundamental rights . To achieve this , we will develop mutual principles , concrete implementation tools and also value-based innovation projects . And I think this outcome shows that there is no transatlantic contradiction between promoting innovation and protecting our fundamental values . Second , on semiconductors , we will work on rebalancing global supply chains with a view to enhancing security of supply , both for the US and , of course , the European Union . We will , as a first step , jointly identify gaps and vulnerabilities behind the current chip shortage , sharing our assessment of information collected from industry . As the next step , we will discuss how to cooperate in our respective investment strategies . We both want to strengthen our domestic capacities while sharing the aim of avoiding a harmful and expensive subsidy race . We need to diversify our sources of supply to avoid single points of failure , ensuring that we can rely on them also in times of crisis . I think that is a very important lesson that we all learned from the pandemic . Last , on platforms , the Pittsburgh statement shows that we have built consensus on a set of common challenges , but also shared concerns . These concerns have even been , I think , more relevant after the testimony of Frances Haugen in this House earlier this week . As a first step , we will work with the US on urgent topics such as algorithmic amplification , transparency and data access to platforms by researchers . Both sides have committed to robust and continuous engagement with a broad range of stakeholders , including civil society , to ensure that there is sufficient buy-in , ownership , so the outcomes of the cooperation will have real effects on ground . For this to be successful , it requires the close involvement of the European Parliament , and as Valdis just said , we really welcome the strong support for the TTC , also shown by the visit of several committees to Washington DC last week . As Valdis said , next spring in Europe , the venue and the date have not been set yet , but it will be here within the Union . And of course we hope to keep our engagement with this House ahead of this meeting . "

If Europeans and Americans intend to preserve this liberal order, cooperation is no longer an option but an obligation. We must shore up the shared institutions that regulate trade and international order, but we must also look to the future. We must design the necessary rules to protect our privacy, preserve our cybersecurity and regulate artificial intelligence. The Brussels effect is no longer enough for us.

      "Margrethe Vestager , Executive Vice-President of the Commission . – Madam President , dear Members , I ’ m really encouraged by this debate – with the warm support , but also with the level of detail and specificity . I think , in answering some of the questions , you have actually given part of the answers yourself . One of the main questions , of course , is what actually is the Trade and Technology Council ? Because it can not be a place where we sort of prejudge what will be the opinions of this House . I think that must be absolutely clear . But that doesn ’ t mean that it can be without effect . Just as a side remark , I ’ d say that actually I ’ m quite happy that we can shake hands again because I think that shows that we have moved quite some lines , both in terms of the pandemic , but also in getting to a better relationship with colleagues in the US . I think what was said by Anna—Michelle Asimakopoulou was very precise as a description of what the TTC is . Because what we can do is we can exchange information , we can discuss things that we disagree on . We can align points of view and – I think very importantly – we can be specific . Let me take the question of semiconductors . Here what we have agreed is to collect information on both sides and then to establish a common analysis as to what are the reasons for the chip shortage that we are faced with right now . Obviously , it ’ s really , really difficult to do something about it on short—term notice , but we can make our future , mid— and long—term actions , be informed by the causes for the short—term shortage that we are faced with right now . I think that those important insights will make our work also for the European Chips Act and for a European Chips Strategy so much more solid . The ten working groups are indeed different because they have a different focus . Working groups , for instance , on standards , will not only be focusing on setting EU—US standards , but also on working together in multilateral standard—setting forums . I think it is not to be underestimated how important it is to have such early warning cooperation to know what is being brought up , what is at stake . Because we know that there are others who want to set their standards also in multilateral standards—setting organisations . So , we can coordinate our approaches to key global technology , to economic issues , to trade issues , and because of that we can deepen transatlantic trade and economic relations , basing this on politics where our shared values get a specific concrete expression in real life . I think the second example of that is the work that we are doing on artificial intelligence . The first result was to align our point of view that the critical thing here is to have a risk—based approach , so that when AI is used in cases where fundamental values might be at stake , this is where we should focus . In order to make sure that we have an innovation—prone approach to artificial intelligence so that we can use it as much as possible . So the first step is to align our way of thinking . The next step is to see if we can develop common tools in order actually to see if common principles are being upheld . Because there are thousands and thousands of producers , of coders , of programmers , of future users of AI , who would want to know how to make sure that they are on the right side of our principles . Here , of course , we have an obligation to develop tools that will allow that to happen . As you ’ ll also see , we have a working group as to how to enable small and medium—sized businesses to be part of the technological development . I think that is really important , because the work we do here is actually to open the market so that small and medium—sized businesses will have a much bigger chance based on their merits , on their talent , on their ideas , on their work ethics , actually to get to their customers – which also , of course , chips into the question of platforms that I mentioned in my introduction . One of the things that I will mention to bridge into how the European Parliament can be involved is the One—Stop Shop that Valdis Dombrovskis mentioned in his introduction , because outreach to stakeholders and the scrutiny of the European Parliament is part of what can make the TTC a success . So , we have this website where one can both interact with us , but where also papers become available as soon as possible so that it is open as to what it is that we ’ re doing . I think that is very important . I hope that you will promote this in your constituencies for the different stakeholders for whom it is important . The meeting that we had under the leadership of a Member of this Parliament , Bernd Lange , with a number of other committee chairs being invited , is part of the answer to the question as to how the European Parliament can be involved . I think this debate is also part of how the European Parliament can be involved . And , of course , for us to prepare the next meeting , we will discuss in the set—up chosen by Parliament as to how Parliament can be involved in the preparation of the next meeting . Last but not least , I share some of the remarks made about China . If you look at our AI proposal , you will see that there are use cases where we find it really crucial to say these uses are forbidden in the European Union , because this is not a place of surveillance . This is a place where data belongs to people and not to the state . But I think the key to success of the TTC is that we want something with the Americans and they want something with us , because we have something really strong in common : old democracies , strong fundamental values , the respect of the individual with the integrity of their dignity as the starting point . I think the only way to excel in this world is not to try to answer what other people are doing . It is to find our own way to excel , to over go , to show what we really are about . I think the TTC is part of that puzzle , next to all the many other things that this House is initiating , that this House is pushing the Commission to do , that this House enables Member States to do . Only in that respect can we deliver to European voters what has been promised . Thank you very much for the strong support and for this important debate . "
