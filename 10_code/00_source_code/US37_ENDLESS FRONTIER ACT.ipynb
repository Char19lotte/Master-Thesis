      "Mr. SCHUMER . Mr. President , now , speaking of bipartisan legislation , today the Commerce Committee will begin marking up the Endless Frontier Act , one of the most significant investments in American innovation in generations . The bill will be at the core of comprehensive legislation to address American competitiveness and security in the 21st century . Once again , for the information of the Senate , it is my intention for the Senate to consider and finish competitive legislation before the end of the month . There have been productive bipartisan talks over the last week to improve the Endless Frontier Act . This is an issue I have worked on with my friend the Republican Senator from Indiana for the past few years . He has been a great help , a great partner , and I appreciate his work . And , of course , Senator Cantwell , our chairman of the Commerce Committee , and Senator Wicker , our ranking member , have come together . And everyone had to give a bit here , there , and everywhere , but I think we have a strong bill that should get strong bipartisan support . The simple truth is very simple . The Endless Frontier Act is legislation our country desperately needs . For decades after the Second World War , our country led the world in science and technology , from healthcare to computers , from telecommunications to manufacturing , to defense . Our workforce brought these innovations to the global economy , and it produced more than half a century of prosperity . People in the last 50 years , from 1950 to 2000 , thought the future was going to be better even than the present , and it created the usual American optimism . But things have changed , and one of the things that has changed is years of Federal investment in sciences , and they have exposed long-term weak spots -- serious weak spots -- in our economic competitiveness . This could hurt us dramatically in the next 50 years . The longer we put off investing in sciences , the likelier it is that other countries , like China but others too , will overtake America as the global leader in innovation , and that will have profound consequences for our economy , our national security , even the future of human liberty , and it will have a lot to do with whether Americans believe that the future economically will be better for them than the present , which is part of the American hallmark and trademark , our sunny optimism , which we must restore . There has been a sourness in the land lately . It is our mission to restore it . So to take the initiative back , the Endless Frontier Act provides $ 100 billion for basic research through the National Science Foundation , focusing on the critical technologies of tomorrow , where we have to stay the leader : AI , advanced manufacturing , renewable energy , quantum computing , cyber security , 5G , battery storage , and so much more . This bill will nurture tech labs and tech hubs across the country in places where they are not now . We have to spread the wealth . The clock is ticking on the need to make these critical investments . The Chinese Communist Party has gone to extraordinary lengths to steal a generation of American intellectual property and cheat their way to innovating and economic growth . We do not , we definitely do not -- Democrats , Republicans , liberals , conservatives do not want a future where the Chinese Communist Party dictates the global order and how the world uses 5G , artificial intelligence , quantum computing . That is why the Endless Frontier Act is resoundingly bipartisan . We already have six cosponsors from each side -- six Democrats , six Republicans -- because these issues affect the future of our entire country . I greatly look forward to the good work that Chair Cantwell and the Commerce Committee will do to advance the bill this week . "

      "The PRESIDING OFFICER . Under the previous order , the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1260 , which the clerk will report . The legislative clerk read as follows : Motion to proceed to Calendar No . 58 , S. 1260 , a bill to establish a new Directorate for Technology and Innovation in the National Science Foundation , to establish a regional technology hub program , to require a strategy and report on economic security , science , research , innovation , manufacturing , and job creation , to establish a critical supply chain resiliency program , and for other purposes . Mr. McCONNELL . I suggest the absence of a quorum . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The clerk will call the roll . The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll . Mr. COTTON . Madam President , I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded . The PRESIDING OFFICER . Without objection , it is so ordered . Israel Mr. COTTON . Madam President , just 4 short months ago , hopes were running high in the Middle East . ISIS was wiped off the map , the Iranian regime and its terrorist proxies were in retreat , and Israel was forging historic peace deals with its neighbors . All along the way , the United States was instrumental in this progress . But in just a few months , the Biden administration has dashed those hopes with its policy of weakness and appeasement . The forces of terror are again on the march . Pillars of smoke and fire are rising from Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem . The assault on Israel by terrorist groups like Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad is the latest and most concrete evidence yet that the Middle East is spiraling toward chaos . But instead of standing firm with Israel , the Biden administration 's policy of endless accommodation is fanning the flames of conflict . The President should show strength . Instead , he is broadcasting indecision and weakness . Our greatest ally in the Middle East is under attack . Yet the Democratic Party refuses to say : We stand with Israel . The night sky over the Jewish State blazes with the starbursts of intercepted rockets , and the Biden administration only offers muted calls for restraint . Where are the righteous denunciations of the terrorists responsible for these repeated , premeditated , and unprovoked attacks ? Where are the statements of solidarity with Israel ? Please . From this administration and from this Democratic Party , we ca n't even get the President 's spokeswoman to say that the United States would help resupply munitions for Iron Dome , Israel 's lifesaving missile defense system . So this afternoon , let me provide a little clarity that the President and his party appear incapable or unwilling to articulate . The fault for the death and destruction in the streets of Tel Aviv , Jerusalem , Gaza , and the West Bank lies not with the Israeli Government , much less with the Israeli people . The belligerents in this conflict are n't morally equivalent , the way it is often presented in supposedly enlightened circles . Put simply , there are good guys , and there are bad guys . Israel seeks peace . Terror groups seek death and destruction . Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad are not legitimate state actors . They do n't speak for the Palestinian people and do n't truly care about them . These groups are terrorist organizations run by evil men who commit evil acts in pursuit of the evil dreams of an evil ideology . They purposely fire waves of unguided rockets at civilian targets , while they protect themselves from reprisal using babies , hospitals , schools , and dupes in the media as shields -- what cowards , attacking innocent civilians while they hide behind women . [ [ Page S2536 ] ] Of course , Hamas and the Islamic Jihad do n't act alone . The Palestinian Authority supports , encourages , and funds terrorism in the form of so-called martyr payments -- pensions paid to terrorists who attack Jews . The PA perpetuates cycles of violence by refusing to acknowledge the existence of Israel , teaching anti-Semitism in its schools and leaving its people to wallow in poverty as wards of the international community . And we all know who funds and arms Palestinian terrorist organizations , the world 's foremost supporter of terrorism , the Islamic Republic of Iran . For decades , Iran 's theocrats have staged demonstrations where their fanatical supporters scream : `` Death to America '' and `` Death to Israel . '' The assault on Israel today shows that those chants are not idle threats . Iran 's ayatollahs are deadly serious about wiping the Jewish State off the map . That is why Iran arms Palestinian terrorists with some of its most lethal weapons . Hamas 's arsenal of 10,000 rockets might as well have `` Made in Iran '' stamped on the side . Those are the villains of this conflict , but let 's not forget the heroes . Standing courageously against this organized onslaught is the State of Israel , our closest ally in the region . Over the past week , terrorists have fired approximately 3,000 missiles and rockets into Israel . In response , Israel has defended itself with technological miracles like Iron Dome . It has carried out precision airstrikes against military targets , and , as always , Israel has gone to extraordinary lengths to minimize civilian casualties , despite the terrorists ' best efforts to maximize and then publicize any carnage . While Hamas and the Islamic Jihad fire indiscriminately from Palestinian schools , office buildings , and apartments , Israel responds by hitting those launch sites , but only after -- only after -- they warn civilians , allowing them to evacuate first . Regrettably , these warnings also allow terrorists to escape , but Israel bears that cost because it values innocent life , unlike its terrorist enemies . You may have heard of one recent example Last week , Israel carried out an airstrike against a building used by Hamas intelligence personnel , a building that also housed the Associated Press . An hour before the airstrike , the Israeli military called the AP and other civilians in that complex and warned them to depart . This precaution , once again , allowed Hamas terrorists to escape but also allowed reporters and other civilians to vacate the premises before the airstrike occurred . As a result , no civilians died , and Hamas lost a terrorist haven . Now , in any other country and with any other military -- except America 's , I have to add -- one would hear praise for that military 's restraint and commitment to the laws of order . But because this military is the IDF and the country is Israel and the people are the Jews , they are widely condemned around the world and on the left in America . If you cut through the hysterics and the hyperbole , you can see the truth clearly : One side seeks to maximize carnage and the other seeks to minimize civilian casualties . Besides , I must observe , why is the Associated Press sharing a building with Hamas ? Surely , these intrepid reporters knew who their neighbors were . Did they knowingly allow themselves to be used as human shields by a U.S.-designated terrorist organization ? Did AP pull its punches and decline to report for years on Hamas 's misdeeds ? I submit that the AP has some uncomfortable questions to answer . Yet the AP and its fellow journalists are in high dudgeon about Israel 's wholly appropriate airstrike . Leave it to whiny reporters to make themselves the story and the victim when terrorists are shooting missiles at innocent civilians . In any event , the moral standing of the competing forces in this conflict is simple and clear . Our greatest ally and the only democracy in the region against an Islamist theocracy and its terrorist partners -- most Americans know which side they are on . I speak for them when I say that we stand with Israel . Unfortunately , too many elected Democrats have taken a different stand . Members of the so-called `` Squad '' in the House of Representatives have called Israel an apartheid state and accused it of war crimes . Remember , these are n't obscure backbenchers . Many Democrats herald these Representatives as the future of their party . Meanwhile , 27 Democratic Senators have called for an immediate cease- fire to the conflict . Even the Democratic floor leader , who has long styled himself as Israel 's great defender , has joined this moral equivalence , calling for immediate cease-fire . Hear me clearly . The handwringing calls for a cease-fire are tantamount to Hamas propaganda . Both sides are not the same in this conflict , no matter what the Democrats naively imply . If Hamas puts down its weapons , there would be peace . If Israel puts down its weapons , there would be no Israel . Thankfully , Israel 's leadership is resolute , united , and committed to victory . The United States should respond to this terrorist onslaught with equal resolve . That means we should give Israel the time , space , and resources to destroy Hamas 's war machine and protect its own people . We should also ensure that Israel has the military hardware to weather this crisis . Hamas may have as many as 10,000 missiles , rockets , and mortars in reserve . Meanwhile , Hezbollah lurks to the north with many times that arsenal . We should , therefore , endeavor to ensure that Israel has more interceptors for Iron Dome than Hamas has rockets to kill Israelis . Moreover , we ought to cut off aid to the Palestinian Authority until we can be absolutely sure that not a dime of taxpayer money is being used to buy and build rockets or pay pensions for murderous terrorists . And , finally , the Biden administration ought to immediately end its misguided flirtation with the theocrats in Iran by recalling its chief negotiator and appeaser , Rob Malley , from negotiations in Vienna . If the Biden administration reenters the failed Iran nuclear agreement and grants sanctions relief to the regime in Tehran , in very short order that appeasement payoff will be converted into rockets aimed at Israel , as well as at American troops throughout the region . While Israel is under attack , we have heard plenty of talk and mealymouthed statements from politicians . But in this moment of crisis , Israel needs more than words . Israel needs and deserves our full support to defend itself and its people and to achieve a just and lasting peace . I yield the floor . I suggest the absence of a quorum . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The clerk will call the roll . The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll . Mr. TUBERVILLE . Madam President , I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded . The PRESIDING OFFICER . Without objection , it is so ordered . China Mr. TUBERVILLE . Madam President , I spoke recently about how the President 's `` skinny '' budget is disappointing , dangerous , and a disservice to our men and women in uniform . China actively seeks to outpace the U.S. military , and in some cases , they are succeeding . This is n't a 5- or 10-year problem ; the threat is right now , today . Unfortunately , the military is not the only area facing active challenges by China . Today , I am going to discuss a few at-risk areas that are critical to the stability of our Nation . It is no secret that the Chinese Communist Party , or CCP , wants to replace the United States as the world 's top power . The American people need to be aware of how the Chinese Communist Party is coming after us , not just with missiles and military might but with plans to subdue the American spirit . The repressive CCP uses economic espionage to advance its agenda to weaken our arsenal of democracy . A significant part of what has made the United States a global powerhouse is the strength and resilience of our private sector companies . Whether it is in the technology , healthcare , or energy sector , American innovation is unrivaled . It is what has made us the greatest economy in the history of the world . China 's leaders know this , but rather than go head-to-head in honest competition , they have settled for stealing our intellectual property . Chinese businesses , at the instruction of their government , lure American companies in . They offer cheap labor . They promise [ [ Page S2537 ] ] an `` exchange of ideas , '' but they really want to steal our valuable intellectual property . As President Trump 's Director of National Intelligence , John Ratcliffe , said , China 's strategy is to `` rob , replicate and replace . '' China robs American companies of their intellectual property , they replicate our technology , and then China replaces U.S. firms in the global marketplace . This theft is n't exclusive to just one industry . They will go after whatever they can to get their hands on it -- wind turbines , airplane designs , underwater drones , chemicals , or artificial intelligence technology . According to the Department of Justice , between 2011 and 2018 , more than 90 percent of the Department 's foreign economic espionage cases involved China . By stealing this critical knowledge , the Chinese have given themselves a leg up on other nations . They are using it to expand their military and economic power . Their goal is to surpass the U.S. economy and gain monopoly control over every major industry . We can not allow that to succeed . Even more alarming is what China is doing from within our own universities . The American people may not be familiar with Confucius Institutes , but they should be . Confucius Institutes currently operate at 55 American colleges and universities . While they claim to harmlessly promote Chinese language and culture , they actually serve as a beachhead for the Chinese Government within America 's research institutions . Often , just the presence of a Confucius Institute on campus will enable Chinese officials to stifle any criticism of the Chinese Government at that university . The institutes also allow the Chinese Government to harvest valuable data from research being conducted at our country 's world-class institutions . Who knows what else they could be up to . I was very proud to cosponsor Senator Blackburn 's Transparency for Confucius Institutes Act , which would provide needed transparency to these dangerous organizations . I was also glad to see Alabama A & M , a public land-grant and historically Black university , make the decision to close their Confucius Institute just last month . Congress has made clear that American institutions of higher education that host Confucius Institutes could lose their Federal funding . I hope any remaining colleges and universities with these CCP satellite organizations follow Alabama A & M 's leadership . The United States and the entire Western World have given China valuable concessions for decades . We gave China a seat at the table thinking they would change , but they have played their hand ruthlessly . The hope was that by facilitating economic growth through open markets and giving them leadership roles in the international institutions , China 's Communist regime would finally embrace democracy , human rights , and free market values . It is past time we recognize that despite all its good intentions , this strategy has failed and miserably . The Chinese Communist Party has continually spied on its citizens , violently suppressed dissent , and systematically persecuted religious and ethnic minorities to the point of genocide . President Trump stood up to China . He was the first U.S. President to do so in decades . And he made great strides , but he did n't have enough time in office to finish the job . I sincerely hope President Biden will continue to build on the Trump administration 's momentum in pushing back against China 's aggressive rise . The United States must address the challenges posed by China . I have shared a lot of concerns today , but I am not one to offer criticism without a commonsense solution . Here is one commonsense step Congress can take immediately . The TSP , or Thrift Savings Plan , is the 401 ( k ) -style investment plan that over 6 million Federal and government employees , both military and civilian , use for their retirement plan . The plan manages more than $ 700 billion in assets . Back in 2017 , the Board that governs the TSP decided to invest billions in companies with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party . They wanted to send government employee dollars -- the retirement savings of our military and civilian public servants -- to Chinese companies , including mine and everybody 's here in Congress . These companies are tied to a government that openly committed genocide against its own people . Well , with me , that dog does n't hunt . Thankfully , President Trump put a stop to that plan before it was implemented , but now with President Biden in the White House , the Board could decide to push through this decision . We need congressional action to make President Trump 's decision with the thrift savings plan permanent . I bet if you ask the folks who work in these buildings or who served the United States overseas if they want their retirement savings going to Chinese companies , you would hear a loud no . I will be offering a solution on this tomorrow to protect our national security and safeguard the retirements of those who have served our country with honor and distinction . I suggest the absence of a quorum . The PRESIDING OFFICER ( Ms. Duckworth ) . The clerk will call the roll . The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll . Mrs. BLACKBURN . Madam President , I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded . The PRESIDING OFFICER . Without objection , it is so ordered . Israel Mrs. BLACKBURN . Madam President , over the past week , the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas has launched more than 3,000 rockets at civilian targets in Israel . Violent mobs have taken over the streets of Jerusalem , and even seasoned veterans of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict have expressed shock at the intensity of the violence . This is n't normal . This is n't the Middle East version of the Resistance . This is terrorism . Still , pro-Hamas activists have flooded the media with Instagram-friendly content condemning Israel for defending itself and questioning the legitimacy of Israel 's very existence , which is an argument that in any other context would bring all hell down on the person foolish enough to say it out loud . The level of denial and misinformation about what is happening in Israel and why it is happening is appalling . Nearly every single member of the United Nations Security Council embarrassed themselves this weekend by embracing a generic draft statement condemning the violence but refusing to acknowledge the hundreds of Hamas rockets that started it . The U.N. has a shameful history of ignoring threats and violence against Israel , but rarely in recent memory has the Security Council so blatantly regurgitated anti-Israel propaganda while Israeli civilians cower in fear under persistent rocket fire . Thankfully , the U.S. mission blocked the statement 's release , but I think it is important -- important -- to inject a little reality into the ongoing discussion . First , we must acknowledge that Israel has the absolute right to defend itself , no matter the state of their relations with the Palestinian Authority . There is a world of difference between a state- sponsored terrorist attack on a civilian population and action taken to stop that attack . We have a responsibility to counter the dangerous argument that because Hamas currently lacks the weapons capability to win this battle , Israel must stand by and allow terrorists to slaughter civilians . Second , I would encourage all of my colleagues to join me in making it clear that the United States is and will remain Israel 's closest friend and ally . We will continue to assist with the development and production of advanced missile defense systems like the Iron Dome . We will not step away from that obligation simply because celebrity influencers would rather witness a slaughter than a proportionate response to mass terror . Last , it is important to acknowledge that this violence is a symptom of a much more serious disease . Hamas terrorists may be the ones launching rockets at civilians , but it is Iran , the world 's leading state sponsor of terror , that is paying for it . That is right , Madam President -- it is Iran , the world 's leading state sponsor of terrorism , that is footing the bill for these attacks . When we provide assistance and support to Israel , we are not just [ [ Page S2538 ] ] protecting an ally ; we are containing the destructive influence of our most belligerent adversary in the Middle East . This month , the Biden administration traveled to Vienna to negotiate sanctions relief with Iranian officials . Since then , President Biden has also spoken to Prime Minister Netanyahu and reaffirmed Israel 's right to defend itself from these attacks . However , I would take this opportunity to remind my Democratic colleagues that the United States designated Hamas as a terrorist organization more than 20 years ago . That is right . For the past two decades , we have recognized Hamas as a terrorist organization . As a rule , we do not provide them assistance of any kind . They are a terrorist organization . But by opening the door to sanctions relief for Iran , we can not help but enrich a regime that will not stop until it destroys Israel . That is their goal . We know it because they have told us that is their goal . We must not provide sanctions relief to Iran or give quarter to any regime that allies itself with this evil . It is my hope that all Americans will take some time this week to just unplug and think about this and reflect and then pray -- pray that reason and wisdom will prevail as we seek an end to this outbreak of violence and the defeat of this terrorist group that wants to destroy the nation of Israel . Tennessee Madam President , this weekend , we had a positive development in the status of the I-40 bridge that connects West Memphis , AR , and Memphis , TN . Just as a reminder , last week , inspectors discovered a crack in one of the steel beams supporting the bridge . The crossing was immediately closed to all vehicle and barge traffic . On Friday morning , the Coast Guard reopened the stretch of Mississippi River that runs under the bridge , but the bridge itself remains closed indefinitely . Now , a lot of armchair experts have decided to sound off with the argument that this closure wo n't affect local economies , but with all due respect , those making this argument really should spend a little bit more time out in the real world . This part of Middle America that we are talking about is an incredibly important part of our Nation 's domestic supply chain . We have a 15-mile stretch along the Mississippi River , and that houses 68 waterfronted facilities . Thirty-seven of those facilities are terminal facilities moving products such as petroleum , tar , asphalt , cement , steel , coal , salt , fertilizers , rock and gravel , and grains . Shipping companies and cross-country trucking companies depend on the I-40 crossing , and so do the local grocery stores , industrial facilities , restaurants , retail outlets that purchase the cargo , and , of course , our Nation 's farmers . Commercial trucking constitutes 25 percent of all traffic that crosses the I-40 bridge . The river traffic that flows beneath the bridge is just as important . When the Coast Guard reopened that stretch of the Mississippi , they had to juggle 60 vessels hauling more than 1,000 barges . Yes . We had a little traffic jam in the Mississippi River . It is amazing to me how quickly a problem like this does turn into a bottleneck . Tennessee and Arkansas transportation officials are still working out a timeline for repairs , but as of now , the trucking industry is preparing for a downward spiral . According to the Arkansas Trucking Association , this could cost operators and their customers more than $ 2 million a day , which is an amount that the industry actually can not absorb . This means that the delay could end up costing consumers an additional $ 2 million a day . And depending on what they are buying , they could also see empty shelves due to a supply chain interruption . Meanwhile , the Biden administration is putting all their energy and focus into checking items off of a decades-old wish list of social programs . They put forward an infrastructure package worth more than $ 2 trillion that wastes about two-thirds of this total pricetag on projects that have nothing to do with infrastructure , nothing to do with making sure that major bridges and thoroughfares are safe and open or expanding broadband access or making sure that parents in rural Tennessee can get their kids to school without worrying that a rainstorm will flood the road on the way to town . This is making the American people feel so incredibly unsettled and very frustrated , and Tennesseans are pretty nervous about the future . If I could give the President one piece of advice , it would be this : If you want to waste time peddling Green New Deal policies or expanding social safety nets , admit it -- just admit it . Call it what it is . Do n't call it infrastructure and then turn around and throw pocket change at actual infrastructure problems that need to be addressed right now . That mislabeling makes it look like you are trying to pull a fast one over the American people , and it makes the American people believe that you really do n't care . And that is a dangerous message to send in the middle of a traumatic pandemic recovery , especially considering that prices are already on the rise . We see it in utilities . We see it at the gas pump . We see it in the packaged snacks we purchase for the children 's Sunday school class . Even basics in the produce section at the grocery store are beginning to get out of reach . It is affecting basic nutrition . This is the Biden surcharge . We are paying a premium just to live from the moment our feet hit the floor in the morning to the time we brush our teeth and get into bed at night . The barebones cost of living is going up thanks to these reckless spending priorities . My Democratic colleagues need to understand that a government subsidy can not save a family from that kind of hit to their monthly budget , affecting everything from the moment their feet hit the floor in the morning to the time they brush their teeth and go to bed in the evening . The Biden administration is creating a perfect storm of income insecurity , shortages , and the uneasiness that comes when Americans see more month at the end of their money than money at the end of the month . They know how to manage their budget , and they know what they have to do when prices creep up 25 cents , $ 1 or $ 2 at a time . Their instinct is n't to reach out to the Federal Government for help ; their instinct and their action is to cut back on the extras and to prepare for harder times ahead . The only way to avoid this even now is to make prudent , targeted investments in economic recovery , supply chain security , cyber security , and , yes , actual real infrastructure projects . The American people can not afford all the extras that are on the Democratic Party 's wish list . Their income ca n't keep up with the inflation that is hitting their pocketbook every single day of the week . And they really are concerned with what will happen when those trend lines cross and inflation heads north every single day . I would , again , ask my Democratic colleagues to step back from the money printer and recognize the effect all this spending is having on American families . I yield the floor I suggest the absence of a quorum . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The clerk will call the roll . The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll . Mr. MURPHY . Madam President , I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded . The PRESIDING OFFICER . Without objection , it is so ordered . Mr. MURPHY . Madam President , I further ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call with respect to the cloture motion for the motion to proceed to Calendar No . 58 , S. 1260 , be waived . The PRESIDING OFFICER . Without objection , it is so ordered . Mr. MURPHY . Finally , I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to finish my remarks prior to the upcoming vote . The PRESIDING OFFICER . Without objection , it is so ordered . Israel Mr. MURPHY . Madam President , I come to the floor this afternoon to talk about two issues of vital importance to the United States and the world . First , I want to say a few words about the current violence paralyzing Israel and the Palestinian territories , but then I want to spend the bulk of my remarks on the future of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East . First , here in America , our hearts are breaking for Israelis and Palestinians . [ [ Page S2539 ] ] The images are just bone-chilling -- rockets and interceptors streaking across the night sky , parents huddled with their children as air raid sirens ring out , tragic images of innocent Israeli and Palestinian civilians , including children , injured or killed in the blasts . For many Americans who are turning on the news this week , it might appear that the events of the last few days erupted almost overnight . While tensions are now reaching a fevered and deadly pitch , this cataclysm has been long in the making and no party , including the United States of America , has completely clean hands . Zero-sum politics have driven both the decision making of the Netanyahu government and Palestinian leadership , to the extent that there is such a thing as Palestinian leadership . Those decisions have led us to this crisis . Over and over , Prime Minister Netanyahu has pushed Israeli settlements further into territory historically considered reserved for a future Palestinian State . The Israeli Government , increasingly reliant on rightwing , zero-sum political constituencies for its survival , also stepped up campaigns to remove Palestinians from areas in East Jerusalem as a means to undermine the Palestinian claim to that section of the ancient city as the capital of a future state . The spark that lit the match of the existing conflagration was the Israeli effort to remove Palestinian families from their homes in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah and replace them with Israeli settlers . In February , the Israeli court ordered Palestinian families in that neighborhood to vacate their homes by May 2 or they would be forcibly removed . Protests began , spread to other cities in Israel with large Arab populations , while the Palestinian families awaited a final ruling from the Israeli Supreme Court . As these protests spread and grew in size , Israeli police adopted some tactics that we have seen on display here in the United States -- an overly securitized approach that only escalated rather than defused the tension . Those crackdowns led to more protests and more clashes and a cycle that continued and continued . Then Israeli security forces stormed Islam 's third holiest site in Jerusalem during Ramadan prayers . Now , the Israelis contend that they were responding to a rock thrown from Palestinians inside . The Palestinians argue it was the other way around . But whatever happened , at the end of that night , more than 330 Palestinians and 22 Israelis had been injured . The story of the Palestinians ' conduct over the last decade is just as important in understanding the roots of the existing crisis . Fatah , the main political party representing Palestinians , has failed the people it represents . Ripe with internal conflict and corruption , Fatah lost its mandate to govern Gaza in 2006 , when Hamas , an internationally recognized terrorist organization , beat Fatah in parliamentary elections there that year . Hamas refuses to recognize the right of Israel to exist and advocates for the armed rebellion of Palestinians against Israel . Fatah , under pressure from Hamas to take more extreme positions , spent most of the last decade refusing any and all chance to negotiate with the Israelis , preferring to sit on the sidelines and nurture grievances . They were unable to deliver any real economic benefit to the people under their charge in the West Bank , and the resulting desperation of Palestinians fed this grievance culture even more . In response to those events I mentioned at Al Aqsa , Hamas and its allies in Gaza started firing rockets into southern and central Israel . Since that day , thousands of rockets have landed inside Israel . These rocket attacks were then responded to by an Israeli Government that has begun its own assault inside Gaza , and as we sit here today , hundreds of Palestinians inside Gaza , including children , have been killed . Although there have not been as many casualties in Israel because of the defense-security relationship with the United States , Israelis have been killed as well . The Israelis were wrong to pursue settlements and evictions as a deliberate means to undermine a future Palestinian state . These policies might have helped hold together Netanyahu 's political coalition , but they helped to feed a sense of hopelessness amongst Palestinians and their future . The Palestinian leadership was wrong to perpetuate an anti-Israeli , anti-Semitic narrative as a foundation of their hold on power . They were wrong to choose grievance over diplomacy . But the United States , over the last 4 years , played a role too . President Trump rejected America 's historic role as a broker for peace and reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians . He chose a side unconditionally , and his alliance with Netanyahu and his rejection of a Palestinian state drove the two parties further apart and turned the temperature up . Trump pursued a path to intentionally create division rather than healing . Those 4 years of America 's absence from its traditional post of mediator is also a big reason we are here today . There is going to be time to talk about the big picture -- to talk about what went wrong and how American policy needs to change toward Israel and the West Bank and Gaza -- but right now , our focus needs to be laser-like on deescalation , on a cease-fire . Hamas must stop its rocket attacks . They are war crimes . They are indiscriminate . They do nothing to help the Palestinians in East Jerusalem or anywhere else . Israel needs to stand down its military campaign as well . They have to take off the table a ground invasion of Gaza . Israel possesses a disproportionate military power . That is why , during the 2014 invasion of Gaza , 2,000 Palestinians died compared with fewer than 100 Israelis . But when children die in Gaza , it does nothing to secure Israel . In fact , it does the opposite . It just provides further fuel to this furnace of grievances . So I am glad that the administration is sending Deputy Assistant Secretary Amr to the region , that he is there . It is critical that we also get a formal U.S . Ambassador to Israel in place as quickly as possible . But the United States needs to be pressing for a cease-fire . The United States ca n't afford to simply allow for this escalation to continue . That is not in Israel 's best interest , and that is not in America 's best interest . My hope is , in the conversations that are happening today between the Biden administration and the Netanyahu government , that they are talking about the terms to bring this violence to an end . Now , as to the second topic , I recently spent 5 days in the Middle East last week . I came back just before this recent spate of violence began in Gaza and Israel . During the 5 days I was in the Middle East , I crossed paths with a bunch of Biden officials who were making stops throughout the region , and I can report that , in setting aside the conflict in Israel -- something that is pretty hard to do right now -- there is some real positive news to bring back from the Gulf . The 4-year-long rift between Qatar and its Gulf neighbors is healing . There is now a new diplomatic energy behind cease-fire talks in Yemen , and the Saudis and the Iranians are in direct talks for the first time in years . All of this -- I was repeatedly told by leaders in the Middle East -- is happening because President Biden has made clear that deescalation is going to be rewarded and supported by the United States -- a stark departure from the Trump administration . Now , this is good news , but the bad news quickly follows , and it is this : If the United States does not reenter the Iran nuclear agreement , all of this nascent progress is going to be at risk . Joe Biden ran on a promise to reenter the Iran nuclear agreement . He made this commitment because he knew that this agreement was critical to American security . With Iran 's nuclear program curtailed and inspectors allowed to comb every inch of the country to look for signs of a secret enrichment program , the world could breathe a sigh of relief in knowing that , for all of Iran 's other malevolent behaviors and policies , at least we knew that they were not developing a nuclear weapon . The achievement of the deal also brought together a set of really unlikely bedfellows -- the United States and Europe but also Russia and China . On Iran policy , with this coalition of regular adversaries , it was intact at the end of the Obama administration . It was ready to be picked up by President Trump to confront Iran 's ballistic [ [ Page S2540 ] ] missile program or their support for regional proxy forces like Hezbollah , but Trump went in a different direction . Instead of building on the Iran deal , he decided to put to test the theory of its opponents . That theory is this : that if the United States imposed unilateral , crippling sanctions on Iran , leaders in Tehran would limp to the negotiating table , cowed and willing to put all of the issues -- nuclear enrichment , missiles , human rights , proxy support -- up for discussion . That is what Obama 's critics said he should have done , and those critics cheered when Trump took their advice . What happened , of course , was a policy cataclysm . Trump imposed the sanctions , and our partners , instead of following America 's lead , effectively took the Iranian side , even helping Iran work around our sanctions . Making matters worse , when Trump sent word to the Iranians of our 12 demands , they refused to talk . Instead , they did the opposite . They ratcheted up their bad behavior . They sent more support to the Houthis in Yemen . They restarted dormant parts of their nuclear program , reducing their breakout time to a weapon from just over a year to just under 3 months , and they resumed attacks on American forces in the region , both directly and through proxies . Here is a pretty simple way to take a look at the success of the maximum pressure campaign . One element of the Iran nuclear deal was a commitment by Iran to reduce their enriched uranium stockpile . You can see , in the years leading up to the deal , there is a dramatic escalation in the amount of enriched uranium the Iranians are holding . Then immediately upon the deal 's being reached , it plummets . Yet here is the bad news : As soon as the maximum pressure campaign is unveiled by President Trump , those numbers start to creep back up again . One chart explains to you the effect of Trump 's maximum pressure campaign . It was a spectacular failure and definitive proof that the alternative approach , cheered by the Iran deal 's opponents -- keep the sanctions in place until Iran totally capitulates -- was a fantasy . Instead , the situation has empowered the more hardline wing of an already hardline regime who is prepared to perpetually operate a resistance economy and blame the United States for the nation 's suffering . Yet now those same critics of the nuclear agreement are back , and incredibly , despit the writing inked on the wall during the past 4 years , their argument has n't changed a bit . Just keep doing what Trump did , and this time it will work , they say . They suggest that getting back into the nuclear deal , as Biden pledged during the campaign , is n't enough . They want a new deal that includes a resolution to all of Iran 's bad acts , but unless we are prepared to invade Iran and demand unconditional surrender -- news flash : We are not -- then that comprehensive , soup-to-nuts deal is a neoconservative fantasy . It does n't exist in real life . In real life , the achievable result is a restart of the nuclear agreement . The good news is that this result in 2021 might have an even greater peace dividend than when it was executed the first time in 2015 . This brings me back to my trip to the region . I heard this story , while I was there , of how quickly talks on healing the Gulf Cooperation Council rift matured as soon as Biden won the election . Countries that were at one another 's throats throughout the Trump administration were suddenly coming to terms with one another . While conflict and bullying and score-settling -- Trump 's calling cards -- were rewarded during his term , countries quickly realized that diplomacy and deescalation would most quickly win favor with President Biden . In Oman , I heard how the Saudis were suddenly much more willing to make additional concessions in Yemen and how the Houthis were now more likely to trust the United States as an interlocutor . In Jordan , the King talked to us about how an Iraqi Government was now more welcoming than ever of help from places other than Iran , and he spoke of Jordan 's new overtures to a Baghdad Government in its looking for a more diverse set of allies . And everyone in the region , at every stop , buzzed about these talks , these dialogues , between the Saudis and the Iranians . Reports suggest that these two countries wanted to talk during the Trump administration but were discouraged from doing so . This momentum toward peace is encouraging , but it is so fragile , and one major setback , one major , unexpected diplomatic hiccup , could turn all of this progress around . I worry that this hiccup could be the failure of America and Iran to get back into the nuclear agreement . If the talks fail and the Biden administration is forced to implement Trump 's Iran policy for the next 4 years , complete with these unilateral crippling sanctions , it is easy to see how all of this progress in the Gulf could disintegrate . The so-called Iranian moderates would head back to Tehran with no deal and be defeated in the upcoming national elections . A harder line government , much less prone to diplomacy , would choose to scuttle peace talks in Yemen , end the outreach to the Saudis , and work like mad to make sure that their proxies in Iraq take power in the upcoming parliamentary elections . This could convince the Saudis to double down militarily in Yemen and open up new fissures in the Gulf . Listen , maybe I am wrong . Maybe this is an overly apocalyptic vision of what would occur if the nuclear negotiations go south , but I fear that it is more accurate than fantastical that the stakes might be that high , which brings me , finally , to our negotiations in Vienna . If the consequences of success are so promising and if the ramifications of failure are so dire , then what has to happen to guarantee a good outcome ? And I will end here . First , the structure of the talks is deeply problematic , and that is the Iranians ' fault . They are insisting on this shuttle diplomacy when we should be talking directly to them . Second , countries in Iran 's neighborhood that were hostile or neutral to the talks in 2015 suddenly have their eyes wide open to the benefits of getting back into the deal , so we should make sure that our partners in the Middle East who have the ear of the Iranian Government or the Supreme Leader are applying the appropriate pressure and letting Iran know that their relationships in the region are at risk if Iran fails to get back into the deal . On our side of the ledger , we need to be willing to be creative . Now , of course , any restart of the nuclear agreement is going to require the United States to drop the sanctions Trump applied to Iran 's economy -- that had the same impact as the Obama-era nuclear sanctions . Yet here is the point I want to make : What about the other sanctions that Trump layered on top of the economic sanctions ? For example , it should be expected that the Iranians would want us to lift Trump 's designation of its primary military force , the IRGC , as a terrorist organization . This was n't strictly a nuclear sanction , but it was certainly a key part of Trump 's maximum pressure campaign , and it was specifically designed to try to bring Iran back to the negotiating table on a nuclear program . In evaluating the wisdom of peeling back these noneconomic sanctions , it is important to remember that they were all completely feckless . These sanctions had no impact . In fact , their only impact was to worsen Iran 's behavior , so lifting them would have no practical negative impact . Just as importantly , lifting this particular designation , the one example I am posing to you today , is a rather technical exercise under the U.S. statute , and it actually does n't prevent us from sanctioning the truly bad actors in the Iranian military . For example , our sanctions on some of their most brutal interrogators -- the IRGC 's interrogators -- would all stay in place even if we lifted that blanket IRGC designation . This is just one example of a Trump-era sanction whose erasure would have little to no practical impact . There are many more , but I use this example to show how weighing the equities , the benefits , of getting into the deal are going to be far greater than the imaginary benefits of keeping many of Trump 's noneconomic sanctions . Now , let me be clear . If the sanctions like this are removed , opponents of the deal are going to cry bloody murder in that they are going to accuse Biden of giving more than Obama gave , but this is the exact trap that Trump was trying to set for his successor . He applied [ [ Page S2541 ] ] sanctions on Iran in connection with the pullout of the nuclear deal , but he called them nonnuclear sanctions , hoping the next President would be caught in this sticky web . President Biden should n't be bound by Trump 's tortured sanctions logic . But , just as importantly , let me assure you that no matter the particulars or the details of the agreement to restart the nuclear deal , the deal critics are going to oppose it , no matter what . They opposed it in 2015 . They are going to oppose it again . What we should really be worried about is Trump 's Iran policy becoming , by accident , permanent , and this is what is likely to occur if the Vienna talks fail . Iran will continue to speed up its nuclear research program , the maximum pressure will continue , and a chill will be delivered to the deescalation momentum in the region . But on the other hand , reentering the deal , while effectively already priced into a Biden electoral victory , will be seen as a diplomatic victory , at a perfect time to score a win for diplomacy , and the Middle East countries who have found new affection for a U.S.-Iran agreement will exhale . Now , I am not naive . I understand the Middle East has still dozens of intractable crises , and the events of the last few days in Israel and Gaza are a reminder of the grave challenges that are still there . But the overall mood of deescalation in and around the Gulf is real , and it is much better than the old incentive structure for escalation . So I see these roots of positive change slowly , quietly growing , and , right now , the best way for the United States to nurture those grass shoots is to restart the Iran nuclear agreement . I yield the floor . "

      "Mr. McCONNELL . Now , Mr. President , on an entirely different matter , yesterday , the Senate took a step toward considering wide-ranging legislation that would touch on multiple parts of the U.S. economy in the name of increasing innovation and competitiveness . A secure , productive , and innovative America that can outcompete China is something that all 100 Senators want . Of course , in a place like the Senate , you are guaranteed to find a wide variety of different ideas about the best ways to encourage that . A number of our colleagues have assembled a proposal that touches on a long list of subjects -- everything from funding universities , to regional economic development , to Indo-Pacific geopolitics , to artificial intelligence , to cyber security , and beyond . Legislation this broad needs a thorough , robust , and bipartisan floor process , including a healthy series of amendment votes . As one of my Republican colleagues -- the ranking member on the Commerce Committee -- explained , as he supported moving the legislation out of committee , the current draft is `` not ready for prime time '' yet and deserves a robust process here on the floor . I understand this bill has come to the floor with a bipartisan understanding and the Democratic leader 's assurances that there wo n't be an effort to close debate on amendments prematurely . So I look forward to the Senate 's considering these important issues , and I hope all of this interest in our competition with China will lead our Democratic friends to rethink President Biden 's intention to cut our defense spending after inflation . The single best thing we can do to stay competitive with China is to give our Armed Forces the resources they need to stay competitive with China . "

      "Mr. President , on one final matter , we know the Endless Frontier legislation , which is on the floor today , is part of our response to the competition caused by an increasingly belligerent and aggressive China , and I am glad the Senate has taken up consideration of this legislation . In coming days , I expect both sides to offer amendments to strengthen this legislation and to ensure that it addresses a broad range of strategic threats . As Leader McConnell has said , a robust amendment process is critical to the success of this legislation . One of the most pressing needs , though , is to bolster our domestic semiconductor manufacturing , which will be addressed and is addressed by the underlying bill . We rely on these microelectronic circuits , or semiconductors , for everything from our telephones that we have in our pockets to the cars in our driveways , to the missile defense systems that are right now knocking down Hamas rockets raining down over Israel . Over the past couple of decades , as our need for semiconductors has increased , as we have become more technologically centric , so has our dependence on the countries that produce those semiconductors . Here is a graphic reminder of our dependency on foreign supply chains in order to supply these critical semiconductors that are so important to our economy and to our national security . As you can see , 63 percent of the global market supply of semiconductors comes from Taiwan , 18 percent comes from South Korea , 6 percent from China , but nearly 90 percent of chips are sourced from Southeast Asia . As we learned in the pandemic called COVID-19 , vulnerable supply chains are something we need to be aware of and to fight against . I am reminded of what President Jimmy Carter said in 1980 in the State of the Union Message when he spoke about the Persian Gulf and Soviet threats to the movement of essential energy supplies through the Strait of Hormuz . President Carter at that time articulated the Carter doctrine , as it came to be known . He said : An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America . In other words , it would be an act of war because of the dramatic dependence that the United States had at that time on oil flowing through the Strait of Hormuz . But I think you could consider today that semiconductors are the new oil . Instead of the Strait of Hormuz , we are now dependent on a supply chain from parts of the world we can no longer depend upon . Just as a blockade would have left the world with devastating consequences , a blockade of the semiconductor supply chain would have far-reaching , negative consequences to our national security and economy . In fact , we are getting a glimpse of what that might look like right now . There is a global semiconductor shortage that is largely related to COVID-19 and has led to far-reaching consequences across virtually every industry . In Texas a couple of weeks ago , I met with executives from companies across the range of industries that have been impacted by the shortage of semiconductors , including automotive , consumer electronics , and defense . So we need a strong response to restore domestic semiconductor manufacturing , which is why last year , Senator Warner , the Senator from Virginia , and I introduced what we call the CHIPS for America Act . Thanks to the leadership of then-Chairman Jim Inhofe on the Senate Armed Services Committee , that became law , and it will help restore American semiconductor manufacturing by creating a Federal incentive to encourage chip manufacturing right here in the U.S.A . But the thing we could n't do then , even though the amendment we introduced passed 96 to 4 , to authorize this Federal incentive program , the one thing that was missing was the money and the finances in order to make this happen . My preference is always to fund things through the regular order whenever possible . We simply can not get into the habit of cutting the Appropriations Committee out of the appropriations process . But there is clearly broad support for the CHIPS for America Act . As I said , 96 Senators voted to include it in the Defense Authorization Act . I am committed to securing funding for the program created by the bill , and there have been many conversations about the alternatives available to us on how to do so . Originally , we introduced a tax credit provision , but unfortunately that did not seem to gain the traction that we needed . When we tried to get the funding in December , we came up emptyhanded . But today I am glad to say there is a significant emergency appropriation included in the underlying bill . But unfortunately , politics being what it is and Washington being a political city , there are unnecessary and purely political provisions related to the payment of prevailing wages , which U.S. semiconductor manufacturing companies already pay their employees , and they [ [ Page S2774 ] ] have created a problem for funding this noncontroversial measure to bring chip production back to American soil . I have reached out to our friends across the aisle to try to work in good faith to reach a compromise that allows this funding to pass with a broad bipartisan majority . There is a clear and urgent need to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing and to secure one of our most , if not the most , critical supply chains . Here is what a recent support of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence said : [ T ] he United States is almost entirely reliant on foreign sources for production of cutting-edge semiconductors critical for defense systems and industry more broadly , leaving the U.S. supply chain vulnerable to disruption by foreign government action or natural disaster . It is clear that other countries -- notably China -- are steadily investing in their own semiconductor manufacturing . Today , as I speak , China is building 17 fabs , or manufacturing facilities , in the People 's Republic of China . The United States needs to compete , and in order to do so , we need to pass this essential funding . We should not be bogged down by bipartisan or political points to be scored when , in fact , they really do n't make any difference to the semiconductor industry because they already pay high wages . The only reason to do this is to try to advance the interests of organized labor and impose additional costs on the construction of these advanced fabrication facilities . The fact is , this actually expands the role of prevailing wage requirements because this is essentially private construction , funded in part -- in a modest part -- by U.S. Federal tax dollars . So now is not the time to let politics get in the way of our progress . It is just simply too important to our country . I yield the floor . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The Senator from Oklahoma . Mr. INHOFE . Mr. President , before the Senator from Texas leaves the floor , I want to acknowledge that in Oklahoma , last Sunday , I was with a group of people , and , independent of each other , they asked the same question : Where is America , and what is happening over there right now ? Our best friend and most loyal ally in that part of the world , Israel , is being hit by terrorists , and we are sitting back and not doing anything . It is just not thinkable that that could happen . I think one of the most meaningful things that I had not heard before , stated this way , that the Senator from Texas stated was , if Hamas were to stop the attacks on Israel , Israel would do nothing , but if Israel were to stop responding , there would be no Israel left . That is the situation we have there . It is something that is not understandable . It is something that we are going to do everything we can to reverse . That is not why I am here on the floor , but I just wanted to mention that S. 1260 Mr. President , on this legislation that we are working on right now , we have an amendment . Senator Shelby and I , jointly , have an amendment . Now , we did this initially because I chaired the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee , and it is an agreement that we had 10 years ago . We agreed on parity , that anything that we do that is going to be defense-related is going to be equaled by nondefense . Now , that has been our pattern , Democrats and Republicans , for 10 years , but now the situation has changed , the way it is structured now in this bill , so that there is nothing in there for defense . Here we are in the most threatened position we have ever been in with China . Yet the China bill is doing all these things with China , but it is not doing anything in terms of the military that we are suffering under right now . We have to remember -- a lot of people have forgotten this -- that two administrations ago , in the Obama administration , we had a situation where , during the last 5 years -- that would have been from 2010 to 2015 -- the President at that time , President Obama , had reduced the budget for defense by 25 percent . During the same timeframe , China had increased theirs by 83 percent . Now , just look at that . That is what was happening . That was back in 2015 , and now the situation is really getting worse because , since that time , China has increased its capabilities in hypersonics and other areas , so that they are actually ahead of us in many areas . So what we want to do is just to be sure that , whatever product we come out with , we end up having parity between defense spending and nondefense spending . It is something we have been doing for a long period of time . So the threat has not improved over the last 3 years but has only gotten worse . I think that any bill that really seeks to address the threat from China -- the whole threat from China -- must also address China 's very real military and its broader military-civil fusion that is taking place right now . That is why any response ca n't separate out military and economic competition . It must be whole of government . And this bill is only focused on economic competition , not military . Our amendment , Shelby 's amendment and mine , will make sure that any increase in nondefense , discretionary spending will be matched by the same level of increase to the defense spending . Now , this is not something that is just Republican . This is something that was agreed upon some 10 years ago by Democrats and Republicans . Yet that is not what we are looking at with this . So this would merely be going back and agreeing with what we all agreed to , Democrats and Republicans . In fact , in this document right here -- we often refer to this document . This is the NDAA document that was put together , to remind my fellow Members here , this was six Democrats and six Republicans , all recognized in their skills in military planning , coming up with this document . This was 2018 . Yet , today , it is just as applicable as it was back then . And that is what they talk about -- what is necessary this year to spend on military to try to keep some type of a parity with China . Now , this has to be our top priority . Our security underwrites everything else we do as a nation . That is why America is viewed as the leader of the free world . It ca n't be either one or the other . It has got to be both . The Chinese are competing against us in every area , and this bill currently does nothing to bolster our national defense to confront this threat or to leverage our military and intelligence community 's significant research and development expertise in this area . It does n't establish the sort of cooperation between our defense and commercial sectors on technology and technological development that we need . China is n't just investing in technology , manufacturing , and research ; they are also investing in military . They are putting more money into modernizing their military than ever before . China is on a modernization sprint . They have been channeling money into building weapons that we do n't even have yet , like hypersonics . I was embarrassed about a year ago when China came out and in China , in their parade , they were displaying hypersonics , things we do n't even have yet . That did n't used to be that way . It used to be , following the Second World War , that we always kept ahead at that time . We recognized that there was a risk there and that the risk was something we had to meet . So they are on track to dominate in new capabilities like artificial intelligence and hypersonics and other areas . So , meanwhile , we are crawling forward because we are n't giving our military the resources they need to stay competitive with China . We know what that looks like . It is at least 3 to 5 percent in real growth . Now , that is actually what is in this document right now . They have updated this to show that right now we should , in order to stay even with China , be upgrading somewhere between 3 and 5 percent , this year , in this budget . And we are reducing the amount . It does n't even meet the cost of living . So in the military advantage -- that is what we use to deter China from moving from economic aggression to military aggression -- we have already lost our edge in some areas . So , to maintain our military advantage , it is going to take investment , but President Biden is not willing to make the investment [ [ Page S2775 ] ] we need . He is proposing to cut our defense budget , and that does n't even keep pace with inflation . So , meanwhile , he is proposing to increase all other spending almost 20 percent , and in this bill here it spends as much on microchips for the auto industry as it does on microelectronics for our national defense . Can you believe that ? If we do n't invest in our military deterrent , it is hard to see how any of our other efforts -- diplomacy , innovation , economic growth -- will succeed either . So we will continue to work in a bipartisan fashion to address these needs . I really believe that this should be the first amendment to come up . I do n't know . I am not in charge of that . But it should be . It is one that should be easy to pass because it was agreed to 10 years ago -- that we did n't need to be in a position where we are not keeping up with China . So our amendment does one simple thing . It is parity . It says any change that you make in the nondefense spending you have to have in defense spending at the same time . I believe that should happen . It should take place . I am hoping that we will have an opportunity to vote on that tomorrow . With that , I yield the floor . The PRESIDING OFFICER ( Mr. Kelly ) . The Senator from Washington . Order of Business Ms. CANTWELL . Mr. President , I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of S. 1260 tomorrow , the following amendments be called up and reported by number : Inhofe-Shelby 1523 and Johnson 1518 ; further , at 12 noon tomorrow , the Senate vote in relation to the Inhofe amendment and at 1:30 p.m. in relation to the Johnson amendment , with no amendments in order to these amendments prior to a vote in relation to the amendment , with 60 affirmative votes required for adoption . The PRESIDING OFFICER . Is there objection ? Without objection , it is so ordered . Ms. CANTWELL . Mr. President , just for the notice of our colleagues , I should say we are still trying to work out other amendments , including the Coons amendment and others , so we will be working on that this evening .

      "Ms. CANTWELL . Mr. President , I call up amendment No . 1527 . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The clerk will report the amendment . The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows : The Senator from Washington [ Ms. Cantwell ] proposes an amendment numbered 1527 to amendment No . 1502 . The amendment is as follows AMENDMENT NO . 1527 ( Purpose : To improve the bill ) On page 304 , line 18 , strike `` 3 '' and insert `` 4 '' . Ms. CANTWELL . Mr. President , we come to the floor today after a lot of hard work by the Commerce Committee to pass out the Endless Frontier bill last week -- 24 to 4 . I know my colleagues from the committee will be out here to speak on this important legislation , as will the majority leader , Senator Schumer , who authored this important legislation , and our colleague from Indiana , Senator Young . We thank them for kick-starting what is a very important national discussion about how much we should be investing in research and development or what I would say is American ingenuity or , to put it a little more simply , I just say American know-how , because we are a nation of people who know how to innovate , who know how to use science to transform our economy , and we have done it over and over and over again . I do n't know . Maybe it came with , in getting in a boat and coming all the [ [ Page S2753 ] ] way across the ocean , you had to be an adventurer to begin with . If you had to settle the frontier , you had to be innovative in your own right . If you had to continue to expand our country , you had to have a great ability to take risks in order to calculate and move forward . Yet , somehow , in the United States of America , we are blessed with ingenuity in our DNA . We as a nation are a nation that has figured out that if we continue to partner together with those great , creative minds , that the investment by both the public sector and the private sector and through our universities and now our community colleges and now research centers -- that we can grow our economy , compete on an international level , and protect opportunity for future Americans . So it has been many eras of innovation . When I think about it , I think about Thomas Edison and the light bulb , I obviously think about Henry Ford and automobiles , and in my part of the world , we think about Bill Boeing and aviation . Innovation is so much part of our DNA that I do n't think we sometimes absorb the littler things that we might not know about . People probably do n't know about Nathan Stone Stubblefield , a Kentucky inventor who in 1902 demonstrated the first wireless transmission of communication using magnets . I know we have a big wireless industry today , but people probably do n't know that , in 1902 , a Kentucky inventor basically helped to turn the page on a new generation of technology . People probably do n't know that a Louisiana professor , J. Lawrence Smith , in 1850 , invented the microscope . Think about how much that led to the important discussions of science and healthcare for us as a nation . People probably do n't know that , in Indiana , a State police officer invented the breathalyzer test , a gentleman named Robert Borkenstein , who basically just said , `` We do n't know what is happening here , '' and he introduced and created the breathalyzer test . That is what America is . America is the spirit of know-how and getting things done . In fact , a report read : Americans prioritize being a world leader in scientific achievements more than other global [ communities ] . That is from the Pew Research Center report by Cary Funk and several other authors last September . The report goes on to read : [ S ] even in ten Americans believe it is very important for the United States to be a leader in scientific achievements . Clearly , what makes us different than other nations is that we are willing to put significant American tax dollars on the table to ensure that the national investment , the research in science , and the development of our ecosystem take place . That investment is matched with a good education system , capital formation , and , as I said , private sector investments in research and development . All of that has continued to make us the world leader in science and technology innovation . It also helps us create job growth here at home . The question before us today is , How much research and development should our government be doing given how important th practical sciences and engineering are to the next generation of Americans ? We are here to discuss this proposal by Senators Schumer and Young , who , as I said , have been working on this concept for years because , no doubt , we have fallen off the pace -- that is to say , the pace of scientific research investment at least as a percentage of the GDP . Even though President Bush , in his second term , tried to signal the importance of this investment , he issued a report basically calling the American Competitiveness Initiative the leading world innovation agenda . That was in February of 2006 . In fact , at that time , President Bush said : [ T ] he role of government is not to create wealth ; the role of our government is to create an environment in which the entrepreneur can flourish , in which minds can expand , in which technologies can reach new frontiers . George Bush had it right . He knew that this competitiveness issue was starting to challenge us from a competitive perspective , and he knew that we needed to make a bigger investment . Unfortunately , with the two attempts that we had -- the America COMPETES Act in 2007 and the America COMPETES Act in 2010 -- it really was a goal by us to basically double the NSF budget within a 7-year window . While we started out in the right direction , we had a huge economic downturn , and these goals were not met . If we had kept our promises to these science agencies , we would have invested $ 80 billion more in innovation investments over the last 14 years than we have done today . The challenge that we face now is that , after decades of not living up to what had been outlined for America COMPETES , we now know that it is an environment in which we are facing much more aggressive competition . We have to think about the lack of investment that we did not realize in the context of how long it takes to do technology breakthroughs . Look at just one example , the internet as we know it today . Literally , in the 1960s , the ARPANET was first talked about . It took us to the 1990s to really , with the University of Illinois and Marc Andreessen , to affect what we would later know as hypertext links and a browser . Today , what it means to us is more than $ 2 trillion annually to our economy . When you think about the investments we are asking our colleagues to make today , we have to consider that , in fact , Federal dollars for R & D is near its lowest point in 60 years as a percentage of the GDP . I ca n't say that we are going to discover the next internet , but I can say that , if we continue to underinvest in this , we will be shortchanging generations of innovation . There is no doubt that key investments in research and development in other parts of the world are certainly getting attention . Since 2000 , research and development in China has grown by 1,600 percent ; in Taiwan and Korea by 400 percent ; while , in the United States , just by 150 percent . That is in a 20-year window of looking at this issue . Americans believe that competition is good , and we believe that competition helps to drive innovation . So you wo n't find me as one on the floor who is obsessed about other nations as much as giving a perspective here about what the world market opportunity represents . If we are not making the investments here in science and technology and innovation , not only are we missing opportunities in our own country , we are missing opportunities around the globe . The rest of the Nation , in an information age , is not going to sit by idly , so we have to think about how we move ahead on critical technology that helps us in all sectors of our economy -- how it helps us with supply chains and , certainly , how it helps us with national security . What we are talking about here , with this bill proposed by our colleague Leader Schumer and Senator Young , is more than a doubling of NSF 's budget in 5 years ; it is the start of trying to catch up . It is also a $ 17 billion investment in energy innovation -- a key sector of our economy in which we need to make continued transformation . That represents a 28-percent increase in some of the projects from the Office of Science and things like ARPA-E that could see investment . What we are also investing in , which our colleagues were very adamant about and very convincing , is a new tech directorate -- that is to say that our research is very good with basic and very good with applied but that we actually have to get better with the user implementation of our science and spur more innovation in a more rapid fashion . So we are investing , between this new tech directorate and tech hubs , nearly $ 39 billion to help stimulate the faster translation of our advancements into real innovation . This is something the committee thought long and hard about , and we took testimony from experts who have worked on innovation issues for many years . In this bill , we also increase the protection of intellectual property from our universities . We are helping our universities do better tech transfer but also protect their intellectual property . In an information age , when so much is published online , if other nations , hungry for development , can read our research and act an effect on it because we have n't patented it , then we need to do a better job of patenting our innovations and helping our universities . [ [ Page S2754 ] ] Our universities are unbelievable research institutions , and helping them spend more time on tech transfer is something that we have done in the Pacific Northwest . A new program ushered in there literally led to 20 startups from research that had been done but just had n't been translated into new areas . We also are trying to help get more regional diversity to our research and investment dollars . There are about 25 States in our Nation that previously qualified for a program that says they should get a share of research dollars . This legislation says all the money being spent here , 20 percent of it should go to that , what is called EPSCoR efforts , which is expanding research and development into those States . And for the first time , we will have over at NSF an office of diversity -- an office to focus on the lack of women and minorities in science and to make real progress on this issue . People see the chart behind me , and , yes , it is no mistake , the picture we picked . The point here is that we know from NSF 's own research that we ca n't be passive about this . Literally , the University of Washington got an NSF grant that helped them study why we are not making more progress with women and minorities in science and innovation , and they came back with : It ca n't be passive . You ca n't just put dollars on the table for STEM . You ca n't just put a few programs in place . It has to be an active approach to changing many aspects to the way we educate in science . I am very proud of the University of Washington on this point because they made changes , and now of those who are teaching in what are considered STEM sciences at the University of Washington , 70 percent of them are women or people of color . So we have changed what the face of teaching science looks like at the University of Washington , and now we have to change some of the criteria and curriculum so that we can continue to attract more people . This bill is a very good step in that direction . So what are we trying to achieve ? We are trying to achieve what NSF Director Panchanathan is saying . He is saying that we need , in this next decade and in decades to come , innovation everywhere , tied to opportunity everywhere , tied to our universities . That is what we are trying to do in advancing this legislation . We processed over 100 amendments in committee and a broad range of input from our colleagues . We will , I am sure , here in regular order process many more , but , hopefully , these amendments and more of the substance of this underlying bill we will go into in detail . We have to remember what our goals are with this investment -- to stay competitive , to create future jobs , to help our economy by unleashing innovation , to protect our national security , and do what Americans know how to do best -- that is , use that ingenuity to help create a better future . I will see if my colleagues want to speak , but we will be coming back to expand on many other layers of this legislation . We will be back to talk about semiconductors . We will be back to talk about the new tech directorate . We will be back to talk about NASA funding . We will be back . And that reminds me . If anybody at home is saying , `` Well , you know , OK , that was interesting ; I do n't really know about this ; what is American innovation ? '' just go and Google two things . You can either look at SpaceX rocket return , which they did in 2015 , or Blue Origin . In both of those -- the New Shepherd and the Falcon , two different approaches -- there are literally engineers who said : If we are going to go to space , if we are going to go to the Moon , if we are going back to the Moon and go to Mars , we need to figure out how to have returnable rockets . Just go Google those two clips , and you will see alive and well the spirit of American ingenuity when those engineers see that rocket returning from outer space and reland because they have pulled off an incredible achievement . You will see jubilant joy and excitement over that accomplishment . I guarantee you , we will not see everything that this bill will unleash , but I guarantee you it will unleash things that will deliver that kind of excitement for Americans in the future , and we will have to be very thankful that this Congress set the record straight on the level of investment we need to achieve to keep us competitive . Mr. WICKER . Mr. President , the 21st century will be shaped by the outcome of the strategic competition between the United States and China . Like our Nation 's previous contest with the Soviet Union , the outcome of this great contest will help determine the world that our children and our grandchildren live in . There are only two real possibilities : Either the United States will remain the preeminent global superpower or we will be replaced by China . This truth is recognized on both sides of the aisle in this body . The contest between our two countries will involve every aspect of national life -- including military might , diplomatic skill , economic strength , and the deepest values that shape our societies . The scope and complexity of this challenge calls for bold action , and that is what the Endless Frontier Act is about . This week the Senate has an opportunity to come together on a bipartisan basis and move forward on legislation , now known as the United States Innovation and Competition Act . This will make our Nation more economically competitive , improve protections for U.S. intellectual property and research , and keep us a step ahead of China in this area of high-stakes competition . This bill does so by increasing research at the National Science Foundation and dramatically increasing R & D at a new National Science Foundation directorate . Other Agencies in the Federal Government will also see dramatic increases in the important research that they perform . The Endless Frontier Act , as reported by the Commerce Committee , is a major part of this comprehensive legislative effort . Other committees have also been important partners in this legislation . In particular , I congratulate Chairman Menendez and Ranking Member Risch of the Foreign Relations Committee for producing the Strategic Competition Act , which was reported out of their committee on a 21-to-1 vote . I also commend Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Peters and Ranking Member Portman ; Banking Committee Chairman Brown and Ranking Member Toomey ; Health , Education , Labor , and Pensions Committee Chair Murray and Ranking Member Burr ; and Judiciary Chair Durbin and Ranking Member Grassley for their importan contributions to the substitute product . I will focus my remarks on the Commerce Committee 's contributions to the Endless Frontier Act . Last week , the Commerce Committee held a markup to consider this legislation . We considered hundreds of amendments and adopted over 100 of them into the reported bill , including over 20 bipartisan , separately introduced bills . The markup at times was challenging , but in the end the bill passed the committee on a bipartisan 24-to-4 vote . The Endless Frontier Act will enhance U.S. science and technology leadership through key investments in R & D , regional economic development , and manufacturing . The bill will accomplish these goals in the following ways : First , it will preserve the core basic research mission of the National Science Foundation . The NSF is the world 's gold standard for funding basic research , a sector that fuels new waves of innovation across our society . Basic research answers the fundamental questions of scientific inquiry needed to develop major innovations . The internet , GPS , cell phones , and many other breakthrough technologies have their origins in National Science Foundation-funded research . The Endless Frontier Act will authorize funding increases in NSF 's core science portfolio to support the most promising research proposals . That is the first thing . Secondly , this bill will establish a new Directorate of Technology and Innovation at the NSF to drive faster innovation in key technology focus areas , such as artificial intelligence , or AI , and robotics . We included strong coordination measures to ensure that programs at the new Technology Directorate do not duplicate R & D programs of other Federal Agencies , such as the Department of Energy . These provisions are designed to ensure the wise [ [ Page S2755 ] ] expenditure of taxpayer dollars by preventing bureaucratic turf wars , which can slow down innovation . Third , this legislation will protect intellectual property and research from foreign governments -- most notably , China . The Endless Frontier Act will establish a research security office at the NSF and create a clearinghouse to share information about security risks . It also puts forward policies to protect controlled information , including a plan for background checks on researchers . In addition , it will take critical steps to guard against Chinese intellectual property theft by prohibiting NSF funds from going to researchers who are part of a Chinese talent program or an institution with formal ties to a Confucius Institute . This is a new and important step . Fourth , this bill will reduce the geographic concentration of R & D in a handful of States and universities . Put simply , this bill will be a game changer for the R & D geographic diversity that many of us have sought for years , if not decades . America can maintain our leadership over China only with a sustained effort that is national in scope . We should tap into the wide-ranging talents , expertise , and capabilities of Americans across this land , including Nevada and Mississippi . The Endless Frontier Act will help address these long-standing disparities by increasing funding for the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research , which we have all come to know as EPSCoR . Participation in EPSCoR helps institutions in many States and Territories improve their research capacities and , therefore , compete more effectively for Federal R & D funding . The legislation also invests in minority serving institutions and builds up research capacity in emerging institutions , which have traditionally received a relatively small share of Federal research dollars . No . 5 , this bill will boost regional economic development through the Regional Technology Hub Program . No . 6 , it will support manufacturing programs , in part , by quadrupling the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program , which already exists . No . 7 , it will help America win the `` New Space Race '' against China by including the NASA Authorization Act , which the Senate passed unanimously last year . The NASA bill allows Congress to set priorities and guardrails for the space Agency 's exploration and research programs . No . 8 , this bill will authorize a number of telecommunication programs to improve our telecom workforce and help get all Americans connected to high-speed and reliable broadband . This bill also includes several bills that I have championed , including the Rural STEM Education Act , the Advanced Technological Manufacturing Act , the Improving Minority Participation and Careers in Telecommunications Act , and the Telecommunications Supply Chain Diversity Promotion Act -- significant legislation and a mouthful , too . Overall , this is a strong bill , but it can be made better . As I mentioned at the Commerce Committee 's markup last week , although the bill reported out of the committee makes important changes to the underlying bill , I regret the rushed process that was followed . The underlying bill was introduced on April 20 , just under a month ago . Only yesterday , Senate Majority Leader Schumer laid down a 1,400- page substitute that not only includes the Endless Frontier Act , but major legislation from the Foreign Relations , Homeland Security , Banking , HELP , and Judiciary Committees . Now known as the U.S . Innovation and Competition Act -- USICA , I suppose -- this legislation will make significant changes to our innovation ecosystem and the missions of our Federal Agencies . A bill of this magnitude would normally take a year to write and involve soliciting input from Members and stakeholders across our country to craft a consensus package . Clearly , the Senate should consider this bill with an open amendment process . Prematurely shutting down debate on amendments without this open process would send a false signal to China and the American people that we are divided in an area where , actually , we are united and together . And then , when all is said and done , the effort will have to be paid for and will be subject to appropriations . I hope the majority 's determination to rush this legislation through the Senate is not designed to use a partisan reconciliation bill to appropriate funding for these important initiatives . Science has always been debated in a bipartisan way in this body . Leaving one party on the sidelines in the appropriation process , which I hope will not happen , would have a detrimental consequences for the long-term stability of this legislation . So on the whole , I am positive and optimistic about this bill and about the process that will get us to the end of both parties ' desire . I thank my colleague , Senator Cantwell , for her work as chair of the Commerce Committee to get this bill on the floor today , and I look forward to working with her to improve the bill in the next step in the process -- an open amendment process "

      "Mr. CORNYN . Mr. President , in my lifetime , China has gone from a poor and isolated country to now accounting for nearly 20 percent of global gross domestic product . There is no doubt that the ingenuity of the Chinese people has contributed to this success , but we know the driving force behind this dramatic rise is the aggressiveness of the Chinese Communist Party . Its aims can be summed up with four R 's : resist , reduce , replace , and reorder . China resists American economic influence by manipulating American businesses and industries and stealing intellectual property . It reduces internal dissent and free expression of ideas through mass surveillance and censorship of its own people , and it seeks to exert its power and influence in the United States . The Chinese Communist Party intends to replace America as the world 's technology leader through the Made in China 2025 initiative , which seeks to achieve Chinese dominance in high-tech manufacturing . Finally , it hopes to reorder international norms and institutions around itself . That is their vision . That is their strategy . That is their plan . Now , the Chinese Communist Party 's ruling strategy can best be described as `` win at all costs . '' In other words , they do not play by the same rules we do . And make no mistake , these ambitions paint an alarming picture for the United States and our allies . Former Attorney General Bill Barr said last year : `` It is clear that the PRC , '' or People 's Republic of China , `` seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies , but to replace them altogether . '' In everything from electric cars to advanced robotics , to artificial intelligence , China aspires to lead global [ [ Page S3315 ] ] production and to dominate global production , and they are throwing serious money into the effort to get China there . China is expected to spend $ 1.4 trillion by 2025 covering investments in everything from 5G to artificial intelligence . This is not the time for the United States to be complacent , to sit back and watch the Chinese Communist Party pursue tech domination . By the time it has made significant progress , we would be too late . We need to take action now to ensure that our economy and our military can continue to outcompete China , and that is precisely what we can achieve through the Endless Frontier Act . As Leader McConnell said , a robust amendment process will be critical to this piece of legislation . As I was discussing with Senator Schumer this morning , for most Members , this 1,500-page substitute bill landed on their desks just a little bit earlier this week , so it is going to take a little time for us to understand and to digest the complexity and the ambitions , really , I should say , of this bill . In the coming days , I hope the Senate will vote on amendments from Members on both sides that will strengthen this legislation and ensure that it addresses the broad range of strategic threats we are facing . One of the most urgent priorities is to secure the supply chains of our most important products . We really learned that from the pandemic . When the COVID-19 virus hit , starting in China and then spreading around the world , we learned that China made most of the personal protective equipment in the world , and thus we were competing with China and other parts of the world to get access to the personal protective equipment that our first responders , our frontline healthcare workers , and others needed in order to be safe . That was one of the first signs that our supply chains may be vulnerable . But before any piece of technology becomes usable for its audience , it includes parts and pieces and materials that literally come from around the world . This was the theory of globalization : Go wherever this product can be produced the least expensively . But we did n't count on pandemics . We did n't count on natural disasters . We did n't count on the potential for military conflict to jeopardize the availability of these essential products . Regardless of where a product is finally assembled and packaged , each of those individual pieces is key to protecting the supply chains of our most valuable assets . Right now , supply chains for everything from cars and cell phones to missile defense , to communication systems are at risk because of one tiny piece of technology called a semiconductor or a microelectric chip . It goes by numerous names . I have shown a floor chart previously , and I will probably bring it out again sometime here before we are through , but the fact is , the United States relies heavily on other countries for these essential advanced semiconductors . Nearly 90 percent of those chips are made by companies in Southeast Asia , including Taiwan . As a matter of fact , Taiwan alone produces 63 percent of the world 's advanced semiconductors , and we depend on that sole source for these most advanced microchips . One company , Taiwan Semiconductor , accounted for more than half of the total foundry revenues last year , and , as I said , companies in Taiwan control 63 percent of the market . If for any reason that supply chain was cut off , it would lead to very , very serious economic and security consequences across our entire economy . In recent months , we have gotten a glimpse of what this might look like , particularly when it comes to our car manufacturing capacity . At the beginning of the pandemic , automaker suppliers predicted a drop in car sales , and so they canceled their orders for semiconductor chips . Semiconductor manufacturers replaced the auto chip capacity with other in-demand products , like chips for personal computers that kept kids learning while they were at home or chips that went into ventilators to keep COVID-19 patients alive . But American consumers kept buying cars at prepandemic rates , and the carmakers needed to make up for the chip to meet that demand . Unfortunately , restoring the production of auto chips is not a quick or easy process . There is a long lead time , in fact , to manufacturing a single chip , which can take up to 6 months . Although chipmakers are filling auto chip orders , we are still likely to face a shortage that may last throughout the summer . In response , some automakers have removed certain technology and extra features , like GPS , from vehicles in order to reduce the number of chips they need . Others have cut production across the board and laid off some of their workforce . But as bad as that may sound , it could be much , much worse . The squeeze we are feeling now is more or less the result of a backlog , and we have every expectation that in a few months , things will return to normal . But what if , instead of a decrease in supply due to increased demand , the supply was cut off entirely ? This is not some fictional doomsday scenario ; it is a real possibility . Our dependence on other countries for these chips could leave us in a very vulnerable position if access were suddenly cut off or restricted . Unlike the supply chain shortages we experienced at the start of the pandemic for things like PPE , hand sanitizer , and the like , there is no quick fix here . In order to build a single chip , you need very expensive and highly advanced equipment . You need the skilled workforce . And , as I said before , you need quite a bit of time because it can take months to build a single chip , and that is assuming you have the facility and all the equipment ready to go . A couple of weeks ago , I met with executives in Dallas who represent a full range of businesses and industries impacted by the current chip shortage . An executive at Qorvo talked about how the process of building a new chip fabrication facility is n't just expensive ; it is time-consuming . It can take years to receive all of the high- functioning equipment necessary to build advanced microchips . Building a foundry is a huge undertaking that requires a massive investment . A single foundry where these advanced semiconductors are built can cost upwards of $ 10 to $ 20 billion -- $ 10 to $ 20 billion . Indeed , that is the reason why we are so reliant on Taiwan , because it is a low-cost provider . Again , we made the mistake of thinking that cost was the only thing that mattered , as opposed to dependability of our supply chain . So there is a clear need to bolster our domestic semiconductor manufacturing . The United States is not the only country that sees the handwriting on the wall . Other parts of the world , from South Korea to China itself , to the European Union , are investing billions of dollars in new manufacturing capacity . Right now , as I speak , there is one semiconductor foundry being planned for Arizona by Taiwan Semiconductor . China is building 17 while we are just getting started to build 1 . As I said , the European Union is investing huge amounts of money , about $ 35 billion ; South Korea is investing $ 65 billion ; and China is investing a whopping $ 150 billion in semiconductor manufacturing . Other countries around the world recognize the risks to their economy and their national security given the current semiconductor manufacturing landscape . Our competitors are pouring tens of billions of dollars into boosting their supplies , and the United States needs to do likewise , which is why Senator Warner , the Senator from Virginia , and I introduced CHIPS for America Act last year . The premise of this legislation is straightforward : to create a Federal incentive program to encourage chip manufacturing here in the U.S. of A . Rather than rely on manufacturers in Taiwan or China or compete against other countries for the limited supply of chips worldwide , let 's bolster the supply of American-made semiconductors . This way , we can secure our most critical supply chains , create thousands of well-paying American jobs , and boost our global competitiveness by supplying made-in-America chips to our friends and allies around the world . We were n't alone in thinking this is a good idea . In fact , when we considered the authorization for this CHIPS for America Act in the Defense authorization bill last December , it passed with a vote of 96 to 4 . So it is clear that the entire Senate understands the [ [ Page S3316 ] ] gravity of this issue and its importance . That authorization became law in January , and now we have the job of fully funding these programs so they can actually get to work turning over dirt and getting these foundries off the ground . The strong support for this legislation on a bipartisan basis shows that this is a priority for a majority of the Members of this body . There is no reason these funding programs should n't be bipartisan too . We are already seeing divisions about provisions related to the payment of a prevailing wage , so-called Davis-Bacon provisions , which is , frankly , dividing us , which is a moot issue given the current wages of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing companies . It is a nonissue for them . Yet some of our Democratic colleagues decided to insert this divisive issue in this underlying Endless Frontier bill . We should not allow unnecessary or purely political provisions to weaken our strong support to our consensus commitment to deal with these vulnerable supply chains . I am committed to securing funding to bolster our domestic semiconductor manufacturing , and there have been a lot of conversations about the most effective way to do so . But let me be clear . The Davis-Bacon provisions inserted into the committee markup in the Endless Frontier bill is jeopardizing this funding . I hope our friends on the other side of the aisle will work with us in good faith to come up with a compromise that allows this funding to pass with broad bipartisan support , just like the CHIPS for America Act . There is a clear and present need and , I might say , a clear and present danger to the United States . We need to bolster our domestic semiconductor manufacturing and secure one of our most vulnerable supply chains . As I said , this is a matter of both our economic and national security and something far too important to fall prey to partisan jockeying . I yield the floor . I suggest the absence of a quorum . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The clerk will call the roll . The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll . Ms. CORTEZ MASTO . Mr. President , I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded . The PRESIDING OFFICER . Without objection , it is so ordered . "

      "Ms. LUMMIS . Mr. President , I am excited to announce the founding of the Senate Financial Innovation Caucus with my friend and cochair , the Senator from Arizona . I am delighted that you also have joined our caucus . We are grateful for your participation and look forward to working with you . One of my top priorities and a legacy I hope to leave in this Chamber is to ensure the United States remains a global leader in financial services for future generations . The U.S. dollar is the world 's unquestioned reserve currency . Since the Second World War , this leadership role has given our country enormous advantages , including affordable credit and trade finance . China is not hiding its ambition to knock the U.S. dollar down a peg by offering a competitor payment system that sidesteps the United States . This year , the Chinese Government launched a pilot program for their digital yuan in multiple cities around China . They expect to completely release the central bank digital currency at the 2022 Winter Olympics . A video released by China state-controlled media in December of 2020 openly stated that the digital yuan will allow China to `` actively participate in reforming world economic governance '' and is `` one of the building blocks of China 's move toward world market status and greater involvement in setting the framework of the global economy . '' China does not share the same values as our country relating to fair competition . This chilling reality is one of the many reasons the United States must advance financial innovation and do so now . China is serious about the future . Chinese President Xi stated in 2018 that financial innovation is `` the new industrial revolution . '' In another part of the world , digital assets are protecting many Venezuelans during their current economic crisis and ensuring corrupt government officials can not seize or devalue their hard-earned savings . The U.S. Government is also using digital assets to achieve its foreign policy objectives and to provide humanitarian aid to Venezuelan groups faster than traditional channels . We must work hard today to ensure the next generation of Americans can enjoy the opportunity and prosperity made possible by responsible innovation . Failure to do so could have astronomical impacts on the freedoms and privileges that are essential to the American dream . I have been encouraged by early signs from the Biden administration that they understand the existential threat of China and the promise of financial innovation . China 's moves alone should create a sense of urgency in this Chamber to take action . But it is not just a threat from China that should motivate us . In addition to [ [ Page S3481 ] ] protecting the U.S. position as the world leader in the financial system , proper regulations for financial innovation will have lasting effects in the financial industry in several ways , notably financial inclusion and entrepreneurship because financial innovation encompasses topics as diverse as faster payment and equities settlement , central bank digital currencies , financial inclusion , digital assets , distributed ledger technology , consumer protection , artificial intelligence , and machine learning . This area has remained bipartisan , following in the tradition of many other financial service issues . The Financial Innovation Caucus is rigorously committed to the tradition of bipartisanship and will create a lasting legacy by doing so . Innovation is core to the American identity , and innovation is n't confined to one party . Our job here is to create a framework that allows innovation to take root . Regulatory certainty fosters entrepreneurial innovation . A lack of regulatory clarity , on the flip side , strangles regulation , restrains entrepreneurship . In many cases , financial innovators are simply hungry to know the rules of the road and how they fit into existing law . We need a right- sized regulatory framework for financial technology that both enables new market opportunities and emphasizes consumer protection . The innovator too often loses when competing against business giants with lobbying arms . Together , we can craft regulations that foster innovation , not stifle or unnecessarily direct it . We also need a new consumer protection framework for emerging tech , which promotes access and innovation but ensures appropriate guardrails are in place . Innovators are the lifeblood of America . Each new idea strengthens our future . Innovators have done hard work in coming up with ideas which will bring underserved populations into the financial system , reduce systemic risk , and strengthen our competitive nature on the global stage . Yet there is only so much innovators can accomplish due to our maze of financial regulations . American innovators need clear rules of the road so they can responsibly turn innovation into reality . It is our obligation as government officials to create a framework that clearly enables responsible innovation rather than stifling it . We must do a great deal more in the coming years to clarify and modernize our financial laws . Citibank , Goldman Sachs , Avanti Bank and Trust , State Street , Deutsche Bank , Kraken , and other large financial institutions are now doing much more than dipping their toes into this realm . They are diving into the financial technology and digital asset markets . Financial innovation is here to stay . Younger generations are turning to and prioritizing technology for their investments . In February , CNBC reported that there may be as many as 100,000 millionaires from the appreciation of digital assets like Bitcoin . These technologies , if harnessed wisely , see no color , no creed , and no sex But financial innovation is not limited to regulating digital assets . This caucus will also focus on issues like faster payments , including a U.S. central bank digital currency and FedNow , which have real potential to allow all Americans to receive their paychecks instantly . The lack of real-time payments costs disadvantaged Americans millions in overdraft fees each year and would reduce many Americans ' reliance on high-interest loans . It also traps large amounts of capital for companies , which could be deployed more productively . Tackling these issues will help bring millions of unbanked or underbanked Americans into our financial system . In Wyoming , we live by the doctrine that you have to pull yourself up by your bootstraps . What you earn is a direct result of your hard work . All Americans should have access to their hard-earned money and investments whenever they would like . We can and should use innovation technologies to reduce settlement times in our payment networks and capital markets and to reduce systemic risk and improve transparency . Threats to the world economic system , coupled with the benefits financial innovation can create , is why , today , alongside many of my colleagues from both parties , we are founding the Senate Financial Innovation Caucus . The caucus is a bipartisan group committed to promoting responsible innovation to help the U.S. financial industry truly meet 21st century challenges of a globally interconnected economy and to harvest technology to make markets more inclusive , vibrant , and safe for all Americans . After all , our financial innovation is critical in our pursuit to ensure equal access to financial institutions and opportunities . It is my hope that the work done by the Financial Innovation Caucus will deliver comprehensive legislation to clarify , regulate , and protect America 's edge in the financial industry when it comes to innovation . We live in a digital world . Technology is now engrained in our everyday lives . Our lives should reflect this shift and should not hinder innovation . Only together can we secure the U.S. role in the future of finance . So let 's go to work . I yield the floor . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The Senator from Utah . "

      "Automated Vehicles Mr. THUNE . Madam President , from the beginning , the story of the U.S. auto industry has been one of ingenuity , of taking risks , and of pushing forward . At the dawn of the 20th century , most Americans could hardly comprehend the idea of the automobile . Yet , 20 years later , they had become nearly ubiquitous in American life , thanks to the insistence of entrepreneurs like Henry Ford on making the automobile affordable for the majority of Americans . The democratization of the automobile , rather than the invention of the automobile itself , is , in my opinion , one of most remarkable and uniquely American success stories . Automobiles allowed Americans to capitalize on the economic dynamism of the roaring twenties and helped Americans move and adapt during the Great Depression . They contributed greatly to the American industrial base and the know-how needed to fight and win the Second World War and help propel the United States to its current status as a preeminent global economic and military power . Visionary investments like the Interstate Highway System made cars a staple in American economic and cultural life . And cars certainly made it a lot easier to get to and from rural America . In a place like rural South Dakota , with limited public transportation , the automobile , often a pickup or an SUV , is typically the only way to get around . Today , the automobile industry stands on the brink of a new technological revolution , which promises to dramatically transform mobility once again . Over the past three decades , the internet has transformed our economy and our way of life , and the next generation of the internet , 5G , which is currently being deployed across the Nation , will enable a host of new innovations , including a revolution in vehicle technology : automated vehicles or what we call AVs . AVs will change the way that we move in numerous ways , making the transportation system safer , more efficient , and more accessible . Individuals whose mobility is currently limited , for example , Americans with disabilities , could gain new independence with the deployment of automated vehicles , allowing them to work or visit friends and family safely and easily . I am proud that my proposed AV amendment to the Endless Frontier Act was recently endorsed by the National Federation of the Blind , and I ask for unanimous consent that the letter of endorsement be inserted in the Record "

      "Mr. THUNE . Madam President , imagine a farmer in rural South Dakota who can no longer drive to get to town for appointments , prescriptions , or groceries -- enter the automated vehicle . This technology has potential to keep people in their homes and communities longer . Moreover , AVs have potential to greatly increase roadway safety . Currently , there are an average of more than 35,000 traffic fatalities on our Nation 's roadways each year , including pedestrian , motorcycle , and bicycle fatalities . Automated vehicles could dramatically -- dramatically -- reduce that number . Distracted driving , driving while impaired -- automated vehicles could eliminate those dangers . For automated vehicle technology to advance , it is imperative that the regulatory framework catch up with private-sector innovation . That is why I have pushed for the enactment of AV legislation over the years and why I had hoped -- I had hoped -- that we would be voting to add my automated vehicles amendment to the legislation before the Senate today . I have spent nearly 5 years -- 5 years -- working in a bipartisan manner on a legislative framework to govern the testing and deployment of automated vehicles . The amendment I offered to the bill before us today is an amendment that I had hoped to be able to offer with bipartisan support . It would have paved the way for expanded testing and deployment of automated vehicles in the United States under the oversight of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration . And let me emphasize that oversight point . My amendment would ensure that automated vehicles would not -- not -- touch pavement without the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 's certification that they are at least as safe as a conventional vehicle . The data gathered from the vehicles deployed as a result of this amendment would be crucial to the development of future motor vehicle safety standards for AVs . Unfortunately , bipartisan agreement on my amendment collapsed when special interests expressed their opposition , despite major efforts to accommodate their concerns . And I am deeply disappointed that , once again , Democrats yielded to pressure from special interests against the best interests of our economy and the American people . Advancing AV technology is not just a vehicle safety issue . It is also an issue of U.S. leadership and global competitiveness . Investing in the production of AV technology here in the United States would not only strengthen the resilience of the auto industry but also the Nation 's industrial base and our national security . The auto industry touches nearly every American State . For example , Horton in Britton , SD , manufactures engine cooling systems , providing steady , good paying jobs for that community and strengthening the local economy . The same story repeats itself countless times in communities all across the Nation . Providing millions of jobs and investing billions annually , the American auto industry is a critical component of the nation 's economy . Right now , [ [ Page S3551 ] ] U.S. companies lead the world in AV technology , but other nations , like China , are seizing upon regulatory inaction and striving to take the lead . If we do n't move forward with automated vehicle technology , we will soon see some other nation leading the AV revolution . The legislative package before us today is designed to bolster the global competitiveness of the United States . It is pretty difficult to understand why this reasonable and , I might add , no cost AV amendment that would lead to untold benefits for our Nation 's transportation system , does not fit in . How can a bill making strong investments in artificial intelligence , quantum computing , and advanced manufacturing exclude a legislative framework for AVs ? Are we really going to back down from leading the world in automated innovation and technology and cede the future of this industry to nations like China ? Will we really ignore the enormous -- enormous -- safety benefits of these vehicles just to suit Democrats ' political convenience ? More than a century ago , when the automobile was invented , there were plenty of skeptics , but America 's automobile pioneers did not let that stop them . They seized the moment and pressed forward and ushered in a transportation revolution . We can do that again today or we can cede this moment to nations like China and let the American automobile industry fall permanently behind . That is the choice in front of us . I hope we will choose to seize this moment and pass the legislation we need to usher in another American transportation revolution . I yield the floor . I suggest the absence of a quorum . The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore . The clerk will call the roll . The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll . The PRESIDING OFFICER ( Mr. Schatz ) . The Senator from Illinois . Ms. DUCKWORTH . Mr. President , I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded . The PRESIDING OFFICER . Without objection , it is so ordered . "

      "Mr. President , the Senate is moving quickly , I hope , toward a vote on a far-reaching proposal to confront threats from China . Based on everything we know about the might and the ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party , there is a clear and urgent need for us to take action . Every year , the U.S. intelligence community issues a threat assessment report outlining the greatest challenges confronting our country on the horizon . Topping the latest report , which was released last month , is China 's push for global power . The report outlines China 's efforts to strengthen its military power , diversify its nuclear arsenal , and fine-tune its cyber espionage skills , which are already quite considerable . One major area that can not be overlooked is China 's industrial policy . Through the CCP 's Made in China 2025 initiative , it seeks to achieve China 's dominance in high-tech manufacturing . For everything from electric cars to advanced robotics , to artificial [ [ Page S3846 ] ] intelligence , to quantum computing , China wants to lead global production , and they are throwing serious money into the effort to get there . China is expected to spend $ 1.4 trillion by 2025 , covering investments in everything from 5G to artificial intelligence . The 2021 threat assessment report raises alarm bells here too . It says China will maintain these efforts because `` Chinese leaders see this strategy as necessary to reduce dependence on foreign technologies , enable military advances , and sustain economic growth and thus ensure the CCP 's survival . '' I view this as both an alarming statement but really more as a call to action . If China is making these kinds of investments to increase its independence and global presence , we should be investing in our industrial base and our national security here at home . The most important place to start , I believe , is with semiconductor manufacturing . The pandemic is hopefully soon to be in our rearview mirror as more and more Americans , more and more people get vaccinated . One of the most important lessons I believe we should have learned is the vulnerability of our supply chains , everything from personal protective equipment , most of which is made in China -- and in the global race to get the PPE we needed during the pandemic , China got a head start because China manufactured it and we did not here at home . So that opened up my eyes to the vulnerability of that supply chain , but we ca n't stop there . We need to look at how heavily we rely on other countries for semiconductors because nearly 90 percent of the semiconductors in the world are made in Southeast Asia , with Taiwan dominating the market . In fact , one company , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company , accounted for more than one-half of total foundry revenues last year . Companies in Taiwan control 63 percent of the advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the world . Now , if you are like me , before I got involved in this issue , I did n't really know very much about semiconductors , so I asked my staff to explain to me the significance of this vulnerability . They said : Well , Senator , think of it this way : Everything with an off and on switch involves semiconductors . Well , that helped me quite a bit . Then I asked them to research something for me . I said : You see those rockets that are raining down on Israel from Hamas ? Some of those interceptors are made by Raytheon , an American-based defense contractor . Ask them how many semiconductors are in a single interceptor . They did the research , and they reported back -- 750 semiconductors in a single interceptor . So these semiconductors or microelectronics are everywhere , everywhere -- in the phones we carry , in the planes that our Air Force , Navy , and Marines are flying , the fifth-generation stealth fighter , the F-35 . Semiconductors are everywhere . Given China 's ambitions , it is easy to imagine how they might be tempted to interfere with the supply chain and our dependence on Asian-produced semiconductors . If China were to block or even invade Taiwan , we would be literally helpless . Back in 1980 , Jimmy Carter gave a speech in which he laid down what came to be known as the Carter Doctrine . This was 2 years after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan . He wanted to send a message to the world that they should not mess with U.S. access to the oil that came through the Strait of Hormuz in the Middle East . So he laid down the Carter doctrine . He said : Anybody who interferes with our access to the oil that we need to power our armed services and our economy , that would be an act of war . Well , I do n't think it is an exaggeration to say if another country were to block our access to semiconductors , it could well rise to the same sort of act of war that Jimmy Carter warned about in 1980 . In other words , semiconductors have become the new oil in terms of our dependency , and it is a dangerous dependency we must correct . This is precisely why the senior Senator from Virginia and I , Senator Warner , introduced the CHIPS for America Act . It is crucial that we shore up our dependence on chips manufactured overseas and we shore up our domestic production . The vast majority of our colleagues have agreed that this is a critical task . It was carefully crafted after monthslong bipartisan , bicameral negotiations . Recently , we had a meeting at the White House , and President Biden agreed with us that this was a critical imperative . This is literally a bipartisan , bicameral agreement with the executive branch and legislative branch that this is something we need to fix . Last fall , when we took up the National Defense Authorization Act , we introduced an amendment that authorized what we now hope to be able to pay for , which is an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act , which passed 96 to 4 . Now we need to fund the program , and there is just one issue standing in the way . During committee consideration of the Endless Frontier Act , an amendment was adopted that would apply controversial Davis-Bacon language to the underlying CHIPS for America provision signed into law last year . This provision creates , I believe , an unnecessary distraction from our focus , which should be on defeating this vulnerability in the supply chain . The fact is , current wages of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing companies do n't need Davis-Bacon . They pay much better than the prevailing wage Davis-Bacon would require . So it is really a nonissue when it comes to semiconductor manufacturing . But what is more significant -- and I think the reason why some of our Democratic friends are insisting on this inclusion -- is it represents an expansion over labor policies by applying it to private construction as opposed to public works . Obviously , this would set a troublesome precedent . Leaving this language in the bill , I do believe , has the potential to weaken the support for the broader legislation . And I hope we can all agree that the stakes are too high to risk letting that happen . Last week , I introduced an amendment to strike this unnecessary and divisive provision and maintain strong bipartisan support for the underlying CHIPS for America legislation . A partisan provision with zero impact is hardly a reason to sacrifice the strong bipartisan support we have seen for the CHIPS Act . Republicans and Democrats have worked very closely together and , I think , really in an encouraging and responsible way to bolster domestic manufacturing of semiconductors and confront one of the biggest looming threats to our national security and our economic security . Now is not the time to backpedal on the progress we have made . I expect the Senate will vote on my amendment later this evening . I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment so we can maintain the strong bipartisan support we have demonstrated so far for this critical , critical legislation . I yield the floor . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The Senator from Washington . Ms. CANTWELL . Mr. President , I come to follow my colleague from Texas to talk about the very issue that he brought up , which is where is America going with semiconductor manufacturing , design , and development . On this last point , I am pretty sure we see things differently . I am pretty sure that the majority -- probably all of the Democrats would be enthusiastic about supporting both manufacturing in the United States as well as making sure that if Federal dollars are used , prevailing wage should be applied . I am sure we will differ on that point . But I think that we are , at least on our side of the aisle , supportive of this concept that chip fabrication , chip manufacturing in the United States of America is an important sector and that we are facing a chip shortage and that we should do something about it . If you think about it , semiconductors are like the oil of the 21st century . They have become an essential aspect . They can be found in children 's toys , in appliances , computers , cell phones , our telecommunications networks , and advanced national security technology , as my colleague was mentioning . They enable healthcare , artificial intelligence applications , financial services , and certainly in the area of defense . They have transformed how we communicate , how we learn , how we socialize . Yet they are so complex and manufacturing so expensive , it can cost anywhere from $ 5 to almost $ 20 billion -- $ 20 [ [ Page S3847 ] ] billion is one number I have heard -- just to build these facilities . This is why this issue has become so important . The United States has had strong leadership in the semiconductor area , but massive investments from other nations put us at a disadvantage when it comes to manufacturing . They are subsidizing and getting tax benefits up to 40 percent to build in Korea than in the United States of America . The Endless Frontier Act tries to address that because it really is a national security and telecommunications policy In the 1990s , the United States produced over 37 percent of the global chips supply . As you know , here in the United States , we have 48 percent of the world 's aircraft production , but now with these challenges , as we look at the chip supply , they are down to 12 percent . I noticed in the Wall Street Journal they said : Why do we care ? Why do we care ? They basically are saying that chips in fabrication have become a commodity and that we do n't have to worry about it anymore . As long as we are winning on the design side , we do n't care where it is manufactured . Well , if you ask me , that is so 1980s -- I mean , the idea that you could design a product here and then have it manufactured somewhere else . Maybe that works with shoes or outdoor clothing , but it does n't work with something as sophisticated and changing as a high-tech innovation product like semiconductors . In fact , I would say , if you really think that type of thinking works , just look at what happened . It is really pro-COVID thinking . We thought we could have the design done here and , basically , some of these devices that we use here , like ventilators , we will just produce them overseas . What could possibly go wrong ? Well , we figured out what could go wrong . If we are not manufacturing ventilators here in the United States , something could go wrong , and it did . The question is , What is going to go wrong if we do n't manufacture chips in the United States of America ? The thing I do n't think that the Wall Street Journal quite got right is that they do n't understand that in today 's innovation cycle , having a cluster of design , of manufacturing , of supply chain , of customers -- everybody working together is the new way to have an economic advantage . In fact , there is a recent study done by a Chicago research organization . I am going to read from this report . Basically , it is all about clusters and why clusters are so important : An industry cluster is a group of firms , related stakeholders , and supportive institutions that gain productive advantages from close geographic proximity and related economies of scale . As groups of related industries grow and develop , clustering can help lower business costs and increase the extent of benefits of specialization . Deeper labor pools , better access to customers and suppliers , knowledge spillover -- these and other advantages are derived from an environment of balanced competition and collaboration . I could go on . I will submit it for the Record . That is what is happening with semiconductors . The Asian market has , basically , now become the epicenter for this level of production , and the question is , Are we just going to forgo that and end up , basically , with not 12 percent of market share here but 6 percent of market share ? Then our suppliers are going to continue to go where the investments and the energy and the ideas are . That is why in the United States of America , where we still have clusters in various parts of the United States -- my colleague from Texas knows this well because he has a cluster in Texas . My colleague from Oregon , who was out here earlier , knows because they have a cluster there . There are clusters in places like Arizona . This is about whether the United States of America is going to continue to make this investment ourselves . Chips are essential to our national security and to telecommunications . In 1990 , we produced over 37 percent of global chip supply , and we need to continue to make sure that we are going to be an investor in chip fabrication today . Today , as I said , we are at an inflection point because of what is happening in a global basis . According to Goldman Sachs , 169 industries in the United States have products with embedded semiconductors , and there will be a 20-percent shortfall of components needed for those products . Last month , Caterpillar , headquartered in Illinois , said it anticipated the chip shortage impairing its ability to meet growing demand of construction and mining equipment . We are not just talking about kids ' gaming consoles or computers . We are talking about many sectors of our economy that depend on this . National security experts argue that if there were a greater trade war or military conflict , the United States would not be able to fill its demand for chips for national security and critical infrastructure needs . That means people like car manufacturers , appliance manufacturers -- if you think about 5G and new technology -- the post-pandemic economy wo n't be able to keep moving forward . The shortage also forced the auto sector to cut 27,000 jobs in April alone . Earlier this year , General Motors temporarily shut down three North American plants due to the shortage . Ford cut back Michigan production of F-150s and the popular Explorer . And Dodge is reducing worker schedules in a Nevada plant producing the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango . These are having real-life impacts on us today . The question is , We had a ripple of this just because of COVID . What if we had a ripple of this because somebody decided not to supply things to us ? These are things we have to worry about just in a national security perspective . You have to worry about whether we are going to get a supply chain that we can depend on . We really are at an inflection point . We are at an inflection point where we need to do something about this sector . One of the issues also is that chip fabrication and private R & D make huge investments . What we are talking about here represents a very small R & D investment partnership with the private sector as it relates to this . We are talking about trying to get more manufacturing jobs here in the United States . My colleague was just discussing this sector , overall , and one of the things that people should think about -- and I am pretty sure people at home wo n't be able to see this -- but these jobs in production and in various aspects of design and even on some of the other aspects , even in management and computer , these are all well-paying jobs . These are jobs that , literally , are the types of jobs we want to be producing in the United States . I heard this story about Idaho . Micron , a big company that used to be a major chip fabrication -- they are still doing chip fabrication -- but the number of jobs in Boise , ID , has fallen off , probably in the thousands , because this production has gone to other places . Now we are replacing them with call center jobs . The question is whether we are going to make this investment in a key technology critical to our national security -- critical to a lot of applications of the technology future , whether it is 5G or AI or various things -- and whether we are going to be a competitor in this area of a supply chain and cluster that continues to innovate . We know for a fact that semiconductor jobs in the production area are literally $ 94,000 a year . That is why we are fighting for this because it is a sector , in just the production end , that is high-paying jobs . So are we going to spend time letting things go overseas and basically saying , `` OK , they will allow us to have call centers , '' or are we going to fight for these high-paying jobs in the semiconductor space that we know will help us maintain our expertise and skill in the United States ? I ask my colleagues to just think about the fact that this notion that we design something here and ship it overseas for cheap production does not fit this bill . That is not what we need to do to maintain competitiveness , in the information age , on something as important as semiconductors . I think our history is rich with people like Thomas Edison and the Edison Park , which is what we established in New Jersey , or Menlo Park , or what now exists in Seattle or in various places . People get that innovation happens in clusters . So , if we are going to innovate , we have to make sure the United States is attracting this investment . We have to make sure that we are doing this here , on our shores , with the expertise and support . [ [ Page S3848 ] ] A lot of my colleagues might say : Well , do you know what ? Let 's just have the private sector do this R & D . As I said , the private sector spends a lot on R & D . In fact , we think the private sector spends about $ 377 billion a year on R & D . Yet , as we know , R & D is n't just done by the private sector for its specific interest . Basic science and lots of advanced research and applied science are done by the United States . That is why this bill is plussing up this number here from the National Science Foundation . We had discussions here about plussing up the number from the Department of Energy . Obviously , we had a vote in the Senate of even increasing the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and its dollars . What works about the United States of America is that we are an ecosystem . We are not a top-down . It is not like we are basically the government , saying : This is what is going to be done . We create an ecosystem that is really based on American know-how -- our ingenuity in how to get things done . What we are asking for , as it relates to not only NSF funding in order to continue the work of R & D as it relates to semiconductors , is also to make sure that we are going to continue the focus of manufacturing and design and R & D and development and clustering and supply chain and companies working together . I know how important this is because , in the Seattle area , in Washington State , we are a leader in aerospace technology . We are 49 percent , in the United States , of aerospace manufacturing . If you do n't keep manufacturing , do you think the supply chain will stay in Seattle ? Do you think the supply chain would stay in Seattle forever -- all of those companies ? We have hundreds of companies that make products for Boeing . Do you think they would stay there if it were not there ? They will end up moving where the manufacturing is . That is what the information age is about , and it is certainly about that when it comes to technology products . The technology products are developed faster , quicker , and with the innovation and the input from their customers . That is why , if you look at these centers around the United States , they are also the places at which you will find the biggest users of this technology . They are there , and they are there because they want to be close to their customers . They want to understand their customers ' needs . They want to have interaction . They want to have collaboration . That is what innovation is today . Innovation is doing design and manufacturing close together . That is how we win . That is why we need to pass this legislation as it relates to an investment in chip design and manufacturing R & D and so we continue to attract manufacturing in the United States . Back to my colleague from Texas , who I know agrees with this principle in an underlying way , when the Federal Government wants to make an investment in actual construction , we say that we should apply prevailing wage . I have talked to many of these people in the semiconductor manufacturing-design space . They say : Do you see how expensive it is to do these plans ? Do you see how expensive the equipment is ? It is very expensive ; so we need the best workforce . So guess what . We pay prevailing wage . So we are saying , because we are putting Federal dollars on the table , we should pay prevailing wage . They think we should also pay prevailing wage . I am not speaking for them , but , in general , they feel like that is when they get their best product . I know where my side of the aisle is . We are going to be here to make an investment in this particular sector . We are going to figure out how to be competitive against Asia in semiconductor manufacturing . We are going to continue , as Andy Grove said , to be paranoid because we know that this is a changing landscape , and we are going to follow our colleagues who have made these decisions and make an investment for the future . I ask our colleagues to turn down the motion to strike the underlying bill , as the underlying bill already has this provision in it , and let 's get about this business of waiving a budget point of order and deciding to make the investment that we need to make to be competitive in a key sector of the U.S. economy . If we do that , I guarantee you we will be well-positioned to continue to move forward , and our national security will be more secure because we will have made this decision . I yield the floor . The PRESIDING OFFICER ( Mr. Kaine ) . The Senator from North Dakota "

      "Automated Vehicles Mr. THUNE . Madam President , from the beginning , the story of the U.S. auto industry has been one of ingenuity , of taking risks , and of pushing forward . At the dawn of the 20th century , most Americans could hardly comprehend the idea of the automobile . Yet , 20 years later , they had become nearly ubiquitous in American life , thanks to the insistence of entrepreneurs like Henry Ford on making the automobile affordable for the majority of Americans . The democratization of the automobile , rather than the invention of the automobile itself , is , in my opinion , one of most remarkable and uniquely American success stories . Automobiles allowed Americans to capitalize on the economic dynamism of the roaring twenties and helped Americans move and adapt during the Great Depression . They contributed greatly to the American industrial base and the know-how needed to fight and win the Second World War and help propel the United States to its current status as a preeminent global economic and military power . Visionary investments like the Interstate Highway System made cars a staple in American economic and cultural life . And cars certainly made it a lot easier to get to and from rural America . In a place like rural South Dakota , with limited public transportation , the automobile , often a pickup or an SUV , is typically the only way to get around . Today , the automobile industry stands on the brink of a new technological revolution , which promises to dramatically transform mobility once again . Over the past three decades , the internet has transformed our economy and our way of life , and the next generation of the internet , 5G , which is currently being deployed across the Nation , will enable a host of new innovations , including a revolution in vehicle technology : automated vehicles or what we call AVs . AVs will change the way that we move in numerous ways , making the transportation system safer , more efficient , and more accessible . Individuals whose mobility is currently limited , for example , Americans with disabilities , could gain new independence with the deployment of automated vehicles , allowing them to work or visit friends and family safely and easily . I am proud that my proposed AV amendment to the Endless Frontier Act was recently endorsed by the National Federation of the Blind , and I ask for unanimous consent that the letter of endorsement be inserted in the Record Mr. THUNE . Madam President , imagine a farmer in rural South Dakota who can no longer drive to get to town for appointments , prescriptions , or groceries -- enter the automated vehicle . This technology has potential to keep people in their homes and communities longer . Moreover , AVs have potential to greatly increase roadway safety . Currently , there are an average of more than 35,000 traffic fatalities on our Nation 's roadways each year , including pedestrian , motorcycle , and bicycle fatalities . Automated vehicles could dramatically -- dramatically -- reduce that number . Distracted driving , driving while impaired -- automated vehicles could eliminate those dangers . For automated vehicle technology to advance , it is imperative that the regulatory framework catch up with private-sector innovation . That is why I have pushed for the enactment of AV legislation over the years and why I had hoped -- I had hoped -- that we would be voting to add my automated vehicles amendment to the legislation before the Senate today . I have spent nearly 5 years -- 5 years -- working in a bipartisan manner on a legislative framework to govern the testing and deployment of automated vehicles . The amendment I offered to the bill before us today is an amendment that I had hoped to be able to offer with bipartisan support . It would have paved the way for expanded testing and deployment of automated vehicles in the United States under the oversight of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration . And let me emphasize that oversight point . My amendment would ensure that automated vehicles would not -- not -- touch pavement without the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 's certification that they are at least as safe as a conventional vehicle . The data gathered from the vehicles deployed as a result of this amendment would be crucial to the development of future motor vehicle safety standards for AVs . Unfortunately , bipartisan agreement on my amendment collapsed when special interests expressed their opposition , despite major efforts to accommodate their concerns . And I am deeply disappointed that , once again , Democrats yielded to pressure from special interests against the best interests of our economy and the American people . Advancing AV technology is not just a vehicle safety issue . It is also an issue of U.S. leadership and global competitiveness . Investing in the production of AV technology here in the United States would not only strengthen the resilience of the auto industry but also the Nation 's industrial base and our national security . The auto industry touches nearly every American State . For example , Horton in Britton , SD , manufactures engine cooling systems , providing steady , good paying jobs for that community and strengthening the local economy . The same story repeats itself countless times in communities all across the Nation . Providing millions of jobs and investing billions annually , the American auto industry is a critical component of the nation 's economy . Right now , [ [ Page S3551 ] ] U.S. companies lead the world in AV technology , but other nations , like China , are seizing upon regulatory inaction and striving to take the lead . If we do n't move forward with automated vehicle technology , we will soon see some other nation leading the AV revolution . The legislative package before us today is designed to bolster the global competitiveness of the United States . It is pretty difficult to understand why this reasonable and , I might add , no cost AV amendment that would lead to untold benefits for our Nation 's transportation system , does not fit in . How can a bill making strong investments in artificial intelligence , quantum computing , and advanced manufacturing exclude a legislative framework for AVs ? Are we really going to back down from leading the world in automated innovation and technology and cede the future of this industry to nations like China ? Will we really ignore the enormous -- enormous -- safety benefits of these vehicles just to suit Democrats ' political convenience ? More than a century ago , when the automobile was invented , there were plenty of skeptics , but America 's automobile pioneers did not let that stop them . They seized the moment and pressed forward and ushered in a transportation revolution . We can do that again today or we can cede this moment to nations like China and let the American automobile industry fall permanently behind . That is the choice in front of us . I hope we will choose to seize this moment and pass the legislation we need to usher in another American transportation revolution . I yield the floor . I suggest the absence of a quorum . The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore . The clerk will call the roll . The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll . The PRESIDING OFFICER ( Mr. Schatz ) . The Senator from Illinois . Ms. DUCKWORTH . Mr. President , I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded . The PRESIDING OFFICER . Without objection , it is so ordered . Mr. President , the Senate is moving quickly , I hope , toward a vote on a far-reaching proposal to confront threats from China . Based on everything we know about the might and the ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party , there is a clear and urgent need for us to take action . Every year , the U.S. intelligence community issues a threat assessment report outlining the greatest challenges confronting our country on the horizon . Topping the latest report , which was released last month , is China 's push for global power . The report outlines China 's efforts to strengthen its military power , diversify its nuclear arsenal , and fine-tune its cyber espionage skills , which are already quite considerable . One major area that can not be overlooked is China 's industrial policy . Through the CCP 's Made in China 2025 initiative , it seeks to achieve China 's dominance in high-tech manufacturing . For everything from electric cars to advanced robotics , to artificial [ [ Page S3846 ] ] intelligence , to quantum computing , China wants to lead global production , and they are throwing serious money into the effort to get there . China is expected to spend $ 1.4 trillion by 2025 , covering investments in everything from 5G to artificial intelligence . The 2021 threat assessment report raises alarm bells here too . It says China will maintain these efforts because `` Chinese leaders see this strategy as necessary to reduce dependence on foreign technologies , enable military advances , and sustain economic growth and thus ensure the CCP 's survival . '' I view this as both an alarming statement but really more as a call to action . If China is making these kinds of investments to increase its independence and global presence , we should be investing in our industrial base and our national security here at home . The most important place to start , I believe , is with semiconductor manufacturing . The pandemic is hopefully soon to be in our rearview mirror as more and more Americans , more and more people get vaccinated . One of the most important lessons I believe we should have learned is the vulnerability of our supply chains , everything from personal protective equipment , most of which is made in China -- and in the global race to get the PPE we needed during the pandemic , China got a head start because China manufactured it and we did not here at home . So that opened up my eyes to the vulnerability of that supply chain , but we ca n't stop there . We need to look at how heavily we rely on other countries for semiconductors because nearly 90 percent of the semiconductors in the world are made in Southeast Asia , with Taiwan dominating the market . In fact , one company , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company , accounted for more than one-half of total foundry revenues last year . Companies in Taiwan control 63 percent of the advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the world . Now , if you are like me , before I got involved in this issue , I did n't really know very much about semiconductors , so I asked my staff to explain to me the significance of this vulnerability . They said : Well , Senator , think of it this way : Everything with an off and on switch involves semiconductors . Well , that helped me quite a bit . Then I asked them to research something for me . I said : You see those rockets that are raining down on Israel from Hamas ? Some of those interceptors are made by Raytheon , an American-based defense contractor . Ask them how many semiconductors are in a single interceptor . They did the research , and they reported back -- 750 semiconductors in a single interceptor . So these semiconductors or microelectronics are everywhere , everywhere -- in the phones we carry , in the planes that our Air Force , Navy , and Marines are flying , the fifth-generation stealth fighter , the F-35 . Semiconductors are everywhere . Given China 's ambitions , it is easy to imagine how they might be tempted to interfere with the supply chain and our dependence on Asian-produced semiconductors . If China were to block or even invade Taiwan , we would be literally helpless . Back in 1980 , Jimmy Carter gave a speech in which he laid down what came to be known as the Carter Doctrine . This was 2 years after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan . He wanted to send a message to the world that they should not mess with U.S. access to the oil that came through the Strait of Hormuz in the Middle East . So he laid down the Carter doctrine . He said : Anybody who interferes with our access to the oil that we need to power our armed services and our economy , that would be an act of war . Well , I do n't think it is an exaggeration to say if another country were to block our access to semiconductors , it could well rise to the same sort of act of war that Jimmy Carter warned about in 1980 . In other words , semiconductors have become the new oil in terms of our dependency , and it is a dangerous dependency we must correct . This is precisely why the senior Senator from Virginia and I , Senator Warner , introduced the CHIPS for America Act . It is crucial that we shore up our dependence on chips manufactured overseas and we shore up our domestic production . The vast majority of our colleagues have agreed that this is a critical task . It was carefully crafted after monthslong bipartisan , bicameral negotiations . Recently , we had a meeting at the White House , and President Biden agreed with us that this was a critical imperative . This is literally a bipartisan , bicameral agreement with the executive branch and legislative branch that this is something we need to fix . Last fall , when we took up the National Defense Authorization Act , we introduced an amendment that authorized what we now hope to be able to pay for , which is an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act , which passed 96 to 4 . Now we need to fund the program , and there is just one issue standing in the way . During committee consideration of the Endless Frontier Act , an amendment was adopted that would apply controversial Davis-Bacon language to the underlying CHIPS for America provision signed into law last year . This provision creates , I believe , an unnecessary distraction from our focus , which should be on defeating this vulnerability in the supply chain . The fact is , current wages of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing companies do n't need Davis-Bacon . They pay much better than the prevailing wage Davis-Bacon would require . So it is really a nonissue when it comes to semiconductor manufacturing . But what is more significant -- and I think the reason why some of our Democratic friends are insisting on this inclusion -- is it represents an expansion over labor policies by applying it to private construction as opposed to public works . Obviously , this would set a troublesome precedent . Leaving this language in the bill , I do believe , has the potential to weaken the support for the broader legislation . And I hope we can all agree that the stakes are too high to risk letting that happen . Last week , I introduced an amendment to strike this unnecessary and divisive provision and maintain strong bipartisan support for the underlying CHIPS for America legislation . A partisan provision with zero impact is hardly a reason to sacrifice the strong bipartisan support we have seen for the CHIPS Act . Republicans and Democrats have worked very closely together and , I think , really in an encouraging and responsible way to bolster domestic manufacturing of semiconductors and confront one of the biggest looming threats to our national security and our economic security . Now is not the time to backpedal on the progress we have made . I expect the Senate will vote on my amendment later this evening . I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment so we can maintain the strong bipartisan support we have demonstrated so far for this critical , critical legislation . I yield the floor . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The Senator from Washington . Ms. CANTWELL . Mr. President , I come to follow my colleague from Texas to talk about the very issue that he brought up , which is where is America going with semiconductor manufacturing , design , and development . On this last point , I am pretty sure we see things differently . I am pretty sure that the majority -- probably all of the Democrats would be enthusiastic about supporting both manufacturing in the United States as well as making sure that if Federal dollars are used , prevailing wage should be applied . I am sure we will differ on that point . But I think that we are , at least on our side of the aisle , supportive of this concept that chip fabrication , chip manufacturing in the United States of America is an important sector and that we are facing a chip shortage and that we should do something about it . If you think about it , semiconductors are like the oil of the 21st century . They have become an essential aspect . They can be found in children 's toys , in appliances , computers , cell phones , our telecommunications networks , and advanced national security technology , as my colleague was mentioning . They enable healthcare , artificial intelligence applications , financial services , and certainly in the area of defense . They have transformed how we communicate , how we learn , how we socialize . Yet they are so complex and manufacturing so expensive , it can cost anywhere from $ 5 to almost $ 20 billion -- $ 20 [ [ Page S3847 ] ] billion is one number I have heard -- just to build these facilities . This is why this issue has become so important . The United States has had strong leadership in the semiconductor area , but massive investments from other nations put us at a disadvantage when it comes to manufacturing . They are subsidizing and getting tax benefits up to 40 percent to build in Korea than in the United States of America . The Endless Frontier Act tries to address that because it really is a national security and telecommunications policy In the 1990s , the United States produced over 37 percent of the global chips supply . As you know , here in the United States , we have 48 percent of the world 's aircraft production , but now with these challenges , as we look at the chip supply , they are down to 12 percent . I noticed in the Wall Street Journal they said : Why do we care ? Why do we care ? They basically are saying that chips in fabrication have become a commodity and that we do n't have to worry about it anymore . As long as we are winning on the design side , we do n't care where it is manufactured . Well , if you ask me , that is so 1980s -- I mean , the idea that you could design a product here and then have it manufactured somewhere else . Maybe that works with shoes or outdoor clothing , but it does n't work with something as sophisticated and changing as a high-tech innovation product like semiconductors . In fact , I would say , if you really think that type of thinking works , just look at what happened . It is really pro-COVID thinking . We thought we could have the design done here and , basically , some of these devices that we use here , like ventilators , we will just produce them overseas . What could possibly go wrong ? Well , we figured out what could go wrong . If we are not manufacturing ventilators here in the United States , something could go wrong , and it did . The question is , What is going to go wrong if we do n't manufacture chips in the United States of America ? The thing I do n't think that the Wall Street Journal quite got right is that they do n't understand that in today 's innovation cycle , having a cluster of design , of manufacturing , of supply chain , of customers -- everybody working together is the new way to have an economic advantage . In fact , there is a recent study done by a Chicago research organization . I am going to read from this report . Basically , it is all about clusters and why clusters are so important : An industry cluster is a group of firms , related stakeholders , and supportive institutions that gain productive advantages from close geographic proximity and related economies of scale . As groups of related industries grow and develop , clustering can help lower business costs and increase the extent of benefits of specialization . Deeper labor pools , better access to customers and suppliers , knowledge spillover -- these and other advantages are derived from an environment of balanced competition and collaboration . I could go on . I will submit it for the Record . That is what is happening with semiconductors . The Asian market has , basically , now become the epicenter for this level of production , and the question is , Are we just going to forgo that and end up , basically , with not 12 percent of market share here but 6 percent of market share ? Then our suppliers are going to continue to go where the investments and the energy and the ideas are . That is why in the United States of America , where we still have clusters in various parts of the United States -- my colleague from Texas knows this well because he has a cluster in Texas . My colleague from Oregon , who was out here earlier , knows because they have a cluster there . There are clusters in places like Arizona . This is about whether the United States of America is going to continue to make this investment ourselves . Chips are essential to our national security and to telecommunications . In 1990 , we produced over 37 percent of global chip supply , and we need to continue to make sure that we are going to be an investor in chip fabrication today . Today , as I said , we are at an inflection point because of what is happening in a global basis . According to Goldman Sachs , 169 industries in the United States have products with embedded semiconductors , and there will be a 20-percent shortfall of components needed for those products . Last month , Caterpillar , headquartered in Illinois , said it anticipated the chip shortage impairing its ability to meet growing demand of construction and mining equipment . We are not just talking about kids ' gaming consoles or computers . We are talking about many sectors of our economy that depend on this . National security experts argue that if there were a greater trade war or military conflict , the United States would not be able to fill its demand for chips for national security and critical infrastructure needs . That means people like car manufacturers , appliance manufacturers -- if you think about 5G and new technology -- the post-pandemic economy wo n't be able to keep moving forward . The shortage also forced the auto sector to cut 27,000 jobs in April alone . Earlier this year , General Motors temporarily shut down three North American plants due to the shortage . Ford cut back Michigan production of F-150s and the popular Explorer . And Dodge is reducing worker schedules in a Nevada plant producing the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango . These are having real-life impacts on us today . The question is , We had a ripple of this just because of COVID . What if we had a ripple of this because somebody decided not to supply things to us ? These are things we have to worry about just in a national security perspective . You have to worry about whether we are going to get a supply chain that we can depend on . We really are at an inflection point . We are at an inflection point where we need to do something about this sector . One of the issues also is that chip fabrication and private R & D make huge investments . What we are talking about here represents a very small R & D investment partnership with the private sector as it relates to this . We are talking about trying to get more manufacturing jobs here in the United States . My colleague was just discussing this sector , overall , and one of the things that people should think about -- and I am pretty sure people at home wo n't be able to see this -- but these jobs in production and in various aspects of design and even on some of the other aspects , even in management and computer , these are all well-paying jobs . These are jobs that , literally , are the types of jobs we want to be producing in the United States . I heard this story about Idaho . Micron , a big company that used to be a major chip fabrication -- they are still doing chip fabrication -- but the number of jobs in Boise , ID , has fallen off , probably in the thousands , because this production has gone to other places . Now we are replacing them with call center jobs . The question is whether we are going to make this investment in a key technology critical to our national security -- critical to a lot of applications of the technology future , whether it is 5G or AI or various things -- and whether we are going to be a competitor in this area of a supply chain and cluster that continues to innovate . We know for a fact that semiconductor jobs in the production area are literally $ 94,000 a year . That is why we are fighting for this because it is a sector , in just the production end , that is high-paying jobs . So are we going to spend time letting things go overseas and basically saying , `` OK , they will allow us to have call centers , '' or are we going to fight for these high-paying jobs in the semiconductor space that we know will help us maintain our expertise and skill in the United States ? I ask my colleagues to just think about the fact that this notion that we design something here and ship it overseas for cheap production does not fit this bill . That is not what we need to do to maintain competitiveness , in the information age , on something as important as semiconductors . I think our history is rich with people like Thomas Edison and the Edison Park , which is what we established in New Jersey , or Menlo Park , or what now exists in Seattle or in various places . People get that innovation happens in clusters . So , if we are going to innovate , we have to make sure the United States is attracting this investment . We have to make sure that we are doing this here , on our shores , with the expertise and support . [ [ Page S3848 ] ] A lot of my colleagues might say : Well , do you know what ? Let 's just have the private sector do this R & D . As I said , the private sector spends a lot on R & D . In fact , we think the private sector spends about $ 377 billion a year on R & D . Yet , as we know , R & D is n't just done by the private sector for its specific interest . Basic science and lots of advanced research and applied science are done by the United States . That is why this bill is plussing up this number here from the National Science Foundation . We had discussions here about plussing up the number from the Department of Energy . Obviously , we had a vote in the Senate of even increasing the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and its dollars . What works about the United States of America is that we are an ecosystem . We are not a top-down . It is not like we are basically the government , saying : This is what is going to be done . We create an ecosystem that is really based on American know-how -- our ingenuity in how to get things done . What we are asking for , as it relates to not only NSF funding in order to continue the work of R & D as it relates to semiconductors , is also to make sure that we are going to continue the focus of manufacturing and design and R & D and development and clustering and supply chain and companies working together . I know how important this is because , in the Seattle area , in Washington State , we are a leader in aerospace technology . We are 49 percent , in the United States , of aerospace manufacturing . If you do n't keep manufacturing , do you think the supply chain will stay in Seattle ? Do you think the supply chain would stay in Seattle forever -- all of those companies ? We have hundreds of companies that make products for Boeing . Do you think they would stay there if it were not there ? They will end up moving where the manufacturing is . That is what the information age is about , and it is certainly about that when it comes to technology products . The technology products are developed faster , quicker , and with the innovation and the input from their customers . That is why , if you look at these centers around the United States , they are also the places at which you will find the biggest users of this technology . They are there , and they are there because they want to be close to their customers . They want to understand their customers ' needs . They want to have interaction . They want to have collaboration . That is what innovation is today . Innovation is doing design and manufacturing close together . That is how we win . That is why we need to pass this legislation as it relates to an investment in chip design and manufacturing R & D and so we continue to attract manufacturing in the United States . Back to my colleague from Texas , who I know agrees with this principle in an underlying way , when the Federal Government wants to make an investment in actual construction , we say that we should apply prevailing wage . I have talked to many of these people in the semiconductor manufacturing-design space . They say : Do you see how expensive it is to do these plans ? Do you see how expensive the equipment is ? It is very expensive ; so we need the best workforce . So guess what . We pay prevailing wage . So we are saying , because we are putting Federal dollars on the table , we should pay prevailing wage . They think we should also pay prevailing wage . I am not speaking for them , but , in general , they feel like that is when they get their best product . I know where my side of the aisle is . We are going to be here to make an investment in this particular sector . We are going to figure out how to be competitive against Asia in semiconductor manufacturing . We are going to continue , as Andy Grove said , to be paranoid because we know that this is a changing landscape , and we are going to follow our colleagues who have made these decisions and make an investment for the future . I ask our colleagues to turn down the motion to strike the underlying bill , as the underlying bill already has this provision in it , and let 's get about this business of waiving a budget point of order and deciding to make the investment that we need to make to be competitive in a key sector of the U.S. economy . If we do that , I guarantee you we will be well-positioned to continue to move forward , and our national security will be more secure because we will have made this decision . I yield the floor . The PRESIDING OFFICER ( Mr. Kaine ) . The Senator from North Dakota Mr. BENNET . Mr. President , I am thrilled that we are passing this legislation . It is amazing to me -- and I am sure the Presiding Officer would agree -- that the Senate has actually returned to regular order . We are passing amendments on both sides of the aisle , and I think we are going to have a big bipartisan vote here in the Senate . In having been here for a number of years when the Senate did n't operate that way -- it was incredibly dysfunctional -- it is a great , great privilege to be here at a moment when it is working . So I want to express my sense of gratitude for that . "

      "Ms. STABENOW . Mr. President , it will come as no surprise to anyone in this Chamber that I am extremely proud to be born and raised in Michigan . Our State leads the world in innovation . We are the leaders in making things -- furniture , appliances , wind turbines and solar components and so much more , and , of course , we are the home of the automobile and the automotive assembly line and the middle class of America . Our workers put the world on four wheels . They built an economy strong enough that those same workers could afford to buy one or two or more cars and trucks that they made . Yet our Nation faces a stark choice right now , and that is why the bill in front of us tonight is so very important . We can continue to invest in making things in America or we can decide that it is not really worth the trouble anymore . We can continue to lead the world in the research and development of breakthrough technologies or we can allow other countries to surge ahead while we tread water . And we can stand with our workers on the assembly lines as they build the vehicles of the future or we can watch our plants close , ship our jobs overseas , and let our middle class wither away -- our choice . But I would argue that we may have no choice . That is no choice at all . We know what we need to do . It is time to stand on the side of American manufacturing , as this bill does . It is time to stand on the side of American ingenuity , as this bill does . And it is time to stand on the side of American workers and our American middle class . It is time to take a stand and invest in our shared future and build an economy that can compete with anyone , anywhere , anytime . That is America . That is what the U.S . Innovation and Competition Act does . One of our first orders of business is to increase our investments in research and development , and we have no time to lose . American R & D spending is [ [ Page S3852 ] ] near the lowest point in 60 years -- lowest point in 60 years . What else happened 60 years ago ? Well , the first person flew into space , and he was n't an American . That fact helped light a fire under American leaders . They understood that we could invest in R & D or let the Soviet Union surge ahead , and we did . Today , we are in a race with China , and they are gaining on us . In 2019 , China 's investment in R & D grew by about 13 percent . Ours grew 8 percent . And they plan to boost R & D spending by 7 percent each year through 2025 . That is why it is so important that we pass the U.S . Innovation and Competition Act . It will invest $ 120 billion over 5 years in critical -- critical -- research , including artificial intelligence , advanced computing , and semiconductors . And it will quadruple the investment for the manufacturing extension partnership and provides $ 1.2 billion for the Manufacturing USA Program that is especially important to Michigan . We are proud to have two Manufacturing USA initiatives in our State -- Lightweight Innovations for Tomorrow , or LIFT , and Michigan State University 's Scale-up Research Facility , or SURF . Both are located in the same facility in Detroit , and it is a very exciting place . LIFT 's projects include research into better welding processes for Navy ships and an anti-rollover system for military humvees . SURF is partnering with the Department of Energy and Ford and GM to make sure that America is a leader in advanced vehicle technologies . We are equally proud of our amazing research institutions , including Michigan State University , the University of Michigan , Wayne State , and Michigan Tech . Today 's students are tomorrow 's engineers . We know that . We are counting on their brain power to build a future in which cars are connected and collisions are a memory . That future is being written today at the American Center for Mobility in Michigan and Mcity at the University of Michigan , where connected and automated vehicles are tested , evaluated , and demonstrated . It is really amazing to see . It is being written by Michigan automakers , who are working towards the day where cars are emission-free -- emission-free . I know that President Biden was impressed by Ford 's new F-150 Lightning that he test drove in Michigan last week . I think it was hard to get him out of the car . He thought it was so cool . Last month , I toured GM 's new Factory Zero , which will soon be manufacturing electric Hummers and Silverado trucks , Chevy Silverado trucks . In Detroit , Stellantis , formerly known as Chrysler , is gearing up to build hybrid electric versions of an iconic American vehicle , the Jeep . It is what we have always done in Michigan . We make things , and we grow things . That is what we do . Unfortunately , making things has gotten more difficult recently . COVID-19 exposed the weaknesses in our supply chain , and a shortage of semiconductors has idled multiple auto plants across the country and many in Michigan . Auto dealers that are normally packed with every make and model under the Sun suddenly have fewer choices . Worse , Michigan workers have been laid off -- no chips , no cars , no work . It is not enough to just build cars that are made in America . To remain competitive in the global marketplace , we need to build the component parts that go into the cars and trucks that we build in America -- the supply chain . In 1990 , 37 percent of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity was here in the United States -- 37 percent . Today , it is 12 percent . They are definitely going in the wrong direction , and this is very serious . And the importance of these chips keep growing . Other countries have invested in chip manufacturing . It is time we do the same . The U.S . Innovation and Competition Act provides $ 39 billion in the Commerce Department for incentives that will boost semiconductor manufacturing in the United States and make our supply chain more resilient . It includes $ 2 billion to incentivize the production of mature semiconductor technologies -- the kinds of chips used by our auto companies and home appliances and defense manufacturing . I am pleased that yesterday the Finance Committee passed the Clean Energy for America Act , which will help Michigan and our country launch the next generation of Michigan manufacturing . It includes my bipartisan legislation with Senator Manchin and Senator Daines to help companies invest in new clean energy manufacturing facilities and expand existing plants to build those new technologies , including semiconductors and battery operations . Another way we can boost American manufacturing is to make sure every single American taxpayer dollar possible is spent on American-made products . My bipartisan Make it in America Act with Senator Warren makes it harder for Federal Agencies to use waivers or loopholes to get around `` Buy American '' rules to purchase foreign-made products . I also want to thank Tammy Baldwin and Senator Sherrod Brown for their continued leadership on these `` Buy American '' issues . The Federal Government is an enormous consumer , and we are set to make big infrastructure investments . `` Buy American '' rules means that American dollars flow into local economies when we purchase American- made PPE , American-made iron and steel , and great American electric vehicles . It is time to invest in the research and development that turn American ingenuity into American innovation and U.S. ingenuity into U.S. innovation . It is time to build an American supply chain that can build American products and American jobs in American communities . And it is time to ensure that American tax dollars are supporting those businesses and those workers . I am proud to say Michigan workers built our Nation . It is time for our Nation to return the favor . The bill this evening on the floor is a critical step forward in making sure that happens . I yield the floor . "

      "Mr. PETERS . Mr. President , as we emerge from the coronavirus pandemic , we have a real opportunity to revitalize American manufacturing and harness American leadership in scientific and technological advancement . Today I urge my colleagues to support critical , bipartisan legislation that will do just that . The United States Innovation and Competition Act will help keep our country on the cutting edge of technology , strengthen American competitiveness on a global stage , and protect our national security . International competitors like the Chinese Government are aggressively investing in manufacturing , science , and technology in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage over the United States , and we can not let that happen . In order to maintain our edge , we must make serious investments in domestic research and development , technology , and manufacturing . We know that a strong manufacturing sector is the backbone of any economy . I have long believed that you can not be a great country if you do n't make things . This bill contains a number of provisions to help revitalize and strengthen American manufacturing . A provision in this bill that Senator Stabenow and I led will provide $ 2 billion in new funding for the domestic production of mature semiconductor technologies that are absolutely critical to the automotive industry and other manufacturers all across our country . This provision is essential because our reliance on overseas semiconductor manufacturing is a threat to our economy and to our national security . We are currently experiencing a semiconductor shortage that is causing massive supply chain disruptions and has idled plants in Michigan and other States across our country , forcing auto manufacturers to shut down factories and lay off workers . This is a completely unacceptable situation , and we must immediately work to address this challenge . [ [ Page S3857 ] ] Boosting manufacturing in Michigan and across the Nation requires a comprehensive Federal strategy to help companies grow our domestic manufacturing base . That is why I authored a provision in this legislation to reactivate the Manufacturing Advisory Council and worked to increase funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program , a program that helps small- and medium-sized manufacturers grow their companies and create jobs . Together , these policies will help strengthen our manufacturing sector , advance our economic competitiveness , and create good-paying jobs . The United States Innovation and Competition Act also helps ensure that when we are spending American taxpayer dollars , we are investing in American manufacturers and creating American jobs . As chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , I was proud of our committee 's efforts to include several bipartisan provisions in this package that will strengthen `` Buy American '' requirements . These provisions , including one based on a bill Senator Stabenow and I introduced , will ensure that American taxpayer dollars are being used to buy American-made products and close loopholes that have allowed the use of Chinese- and Russian-made steel rather than using U.S. steel . Growing good-paying jobs in America must always be our focus , and passing this bill will do just that . This package also includes a provision to secure our supply chain and address the serious national security risks posed by our overreliance on companies in China and other countries for medical supplies . During the pandemic , we saw firsthand how our country 's overreliance on foreign manufacturers for critical supplies , such as personal protective equipment , left us unprepared to combat the pandemic and cost American lives . This bill takes important steps to address that , thanks to a provision I worked on with Senator Portman to encourage investments that will expand domestic production of personal protective equipment here in the United States . These provisions and so many more will help us unleash American innovation , lock in our competitive advantage , and grow our economy , but that alone is not enough . We must also protect our advantage . That is why our committee worked to include critical provisions in this legislation to strengthen cyber security and protect against increasingly sophisticated efforts by adversarial governments and criminal organizations to steal our research and intellectual property . Cyber attacks pose a significant threat to our national security , and cyber attacks have significant real-world consequences . We saw this with the recent Colonial Pipeline attack . This bill includes provisions I authored to strengthen the Federal Government 's capabilities to prevent and respond to a significant cyber incident , creates a fund that can help entities recover from serious breaches , and strengthens our Federal cyber workforce , therefore ensuring our workers have the skills and knowledge to build a competitive advantage and secure our networks from these attacks . From spurring advancements in artificial intelligence to securing taxpayer-funded research and intellectual property from adversaries who try to steal it , this legislation takes significant steps to help ensure American companies and workers will continue to lead the way in developing the technologies and economy of the future . The process we followed to write this legislation shows that when we work together in a bipartisan manner , we can tackle the biggest challenges facing our Nation . I am grateful to my colleagues for all of their hard work , and I look forward to continuing to partner with our House counterparts to get these important provisions signed into law . I yield the floor . I suggest the absence of a quorum . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The clerk will call the roll . The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll . Ms. MURKOWSKI . Mr. President , I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded . The PRESIDING OFFICER . Without objection , it is so ordered . "

      "Mr. SULLIVAN . Mr. President , I want to commend my colleagues for the important work that everybody is doing down here on the Senate floor , bipartisan work , addressing one of the most important challenges we have as a nation . Not just today but for years this challenge is going to be with us , and that is the challenge of dealing with the rise of the Communist Party of China . That is going to be more and more of a challenge and focus of the efforts of all elements of America 's economy , military , society . And here is the good news . As you are seeing here , there is a lot of focus , a lot of effort , and a lot of bipartisan work . It is a democracy , a Republic , right ? It is messy . It is not going to be perfect . But , for the Chinese , I think the worst nightmare of the Chinese Communist Party is to see Americans coming together and recognizing that this is something we all need to work on together . China 's economy is growing . Their high-tech capability is growing . Their military capability is growing . Their aggressiveness throughout the region is growing . Just look in the last year : Hong Kong ; the disputes along the China- India border with India ; the aggressiveness toward Taiwan ; the economic embargo , in many ways , against our ally Australia ; Xinjiang Province ; the full discrimination against the Uighurs . And , of course , China is now fully focused on exporting its authoritarian model abroad -- not just at home but abroad . But again , as I mentioned , the good news is that we as a nation , we as a Senate , we as a Congress , Republicans and Democrats , are starting to awaken to this challenge . This is an issue I have been focused on since I came to the Senate over 6 years ago . I think the previous administration , the Trump administration , with their National Security Strategy , National Defense Strategy , which said , hey , we know we have challenges with violent extremists organizations , but we need to start shifting our focus to great power competition with China as the pacing threat -- that is where we should be focused . Those strategy documents -- the National Defense Strategy , the National Security Strategy -- these were actually quite bipartisan documents , quite bipartisan strategies . The National Defense Authorization Act , which will be taken up here in a couple of months , in the last few years has been built around this National Defense Strategy , focusing on great power competition -- China , Russia . So that is continuing . It is actually continuing on the floor here in the U.S. Senate as we speak . What I have been trying to do is work with Members on both sides of the aisle -- certainly with the Trump administration but also with the Biden administration -- as they address this challenge . I had some good meetings with a number of senior officials in the administration , and one takeaway I got from discussing these issues with the National Security Advisor , Jake Sullivan , was a comment he had made about how when we were looking at our challenges with China , we need to think about these in the way in which Dean Acheson , who was a very famous Secretary of State , talked about the beginning of the Cold War with the Soviet Union in the late 1940s ; how America needs to be dealing with the Soviet Union and that Cold War from situations of strength , positions of strength . I thought that was a really insightful comment by the current National Security Advisor . So I want to mention a few of these because we have a lot of them relative to China . Our comparative advantages , in my view , are much greater than theirs in this competition that is going to , in my view , last for decades . So let me name a few of these situations of strength . First , our allies . The United States is an ally-rich nation . China is an ally-poor nation and getting poorer by the day , by the way . Maybe North Korea is one ally . Maybe Russia sometimes , but I do n't really buy it . So that is a huge comparative advantage that we have as a nation , and we need to look at our system , our network of allies and deepen them and expand them . One area that that has happened with regard to our allies , really is a cornerstone of our alliance system in Asia , is the continued focus on what is called the Quad . The Quad is three of the biggest economies and democracies in the whole world : the United States , Japan , India , and Australia . The Quad actually began in terms of a focus of strategy in the George W. Bush administration . The Trump administration highlighted it even more . To the Biden administration 's credit , they took the Minister- level meetings that were the focus of the Trump administration 's effort with the Quad and took it to the leader level . President Biden met with the leaders -- India , Japan , Australia , and the United States -- recently . It is a very important development . The Quad can help anchor our alliances in the Asia-Pacific and beyond in a very significant way . The Chinese are constantly talking about it because they do n't like it because they know what it signifies . So that is one area of strength , situation of strength that I think all of us can agree on , and I think Members of this body can certainly help play a role As we look to head into a work session , I am going to head to the Asia-Pacific with some of my Senate colleagues here -- Senator Duckworth , Senator Coons , and maybe a few others -- and we are going to help build on this important comparative advantage that we have as a nation -- allies . We are an ally-rich nation . China is ally-poor . The more aggressive they are acting in the region , the more this situation of strength is going to play to our advantage . Let me give you another situation of strength for the United States , particularly as it relates to China . It is a huge [ [ Page S3875 ] ] position of strength . It is our energy sector , the all-above energy sector for America -- I mean renewables , oil , natural gas . This is an area that for decades we have tried to become energy independent . We have tried to return to the status we had during World War II , which was the world 's energy superpower in terms of the production of energy . The good news on that is we have returned to that . Prior to the pandemic , the United States had once again become the world 's energy superpower -- a lot of people thought we could never achieve that again , but we have -- the largest producer of natural gas in the world , bigger than Russia ; largest producer of oil in the world , bigger than Saudi Arabia ; largest producer of renewables in the world . This is really good for our economy . It is really good for jobs . It is really good for our national security and foreign policy . And yes , it is really good for our environment . Why is that ? I know some people do n't like the production of energy in America , but here is a fact : We need energy , `` all of the above '' energy . My State has it all , all the things that I just mentioned -- oil , gas , renewables . We have an enormous abundance in Alaska . But here is the other fact : We produced these energy opportunities , we produced this energy in America with a higher environmental standard than any other place on the planet . That is a fact . That is a fact . So if we need energy , which we do , `` all of the above '' energy , which we do , we need to make sure we are producing it in a place with the highest standards , in a place that will employ American people workers . By the way , energy jobs are great jobs . Here is one other thing . You look at the intel . You talk to people who know the region . The Communist Party in China recognizes this comparative advantage , and it scares the living daylight out of them because they are very energy dependent , and we have literally become , through the hard work and ingenuity of so many in our great Nation , energy independent . By the way , not only has this helped our environment , it has helped with regard to greenhouse gas emissions . From 2005 to 2017 , the United States reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by almost 15 percent -- 15 percent . You do n't hear that often , but it is a fact -- more than any other industrialized nation in the world . China was going like this . Still is . By the way , right now , the latest numbers on greenhouse gas emissions -- China is producing more than the United States , the EU , and India combined . That is also a fact . So we have reduced global greenhouse gas emissions dramatically . Why ? We all know why . It was the revolution and the production of American natural gas . That is a fact . That is a fact . So if we want to grow our economy , have an enormous comparative advantage relative to China and adversaries like Russia , produce more good-paying jobs , protect our environment , and enhance our national security and foreign policy , continuing the production of `` all of the above '' energy , which we are going to need for decades , is something that we should be doing . Now , some in the Biden administration understand this . Others do n't and want to restrict production of American energy , and when those people speak , guys like John Kerry , the leaders in China and Russia are smiling . They are smiling . Fortunately , this legislation here , the Endless Frontier Act , is focused on outcompeting the Chinese , all of us coming together and outcompeting them in many different areas -- artificial intelligence , quantum computing , and , yes , energy as well . Specifically , what is in the bill is called advanced energy and industrial efficiency technologies , advanced energy technologies . That is in the legislation . Again , I think it is here because we recognize what a critical , comparative advantage we have relative to China in this sector , so we want to take advantage of it . It is in the legislation . Advanced energy technology is not defined in this bill , but that is because the Congress has been abundantly clear on what this means . In my discussions with Senators and , more importantly , what the Congress has passed a number of times , advanced energy technology means what it states in the definition of a law unanimously passed in the Senate and in the House just two Congresses ago , 42 USC 18632 . It actually has the definition of advanced energy technology , which is what is the focus of this bill , the Endless Frontier Act . "

      "Ms. CANTWELL . Madam President , I come to the floor , hopefully today will be the day we wrap up debate on the America Competes-Endless Frontier legislation now known as the USICA , United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021 . We come to talk about this now , primarily because we know that the research dollars invested today are going to decide the jobs of the future . And we know that we all believe a significant increase in the investment in research and development dollars will help us spur innovation , continue to help us compete , and continue to be competitive in key sectors of our economy that are so important to us . We know that we have been having this debate literally now for more than a decade , starting with President Bush 's 2006 report saying America needed to invest more in the National Science Foundation . And at the time , I am pretty sure we thought we were in a track meet where our competitor was maybe half a lap behind us I am pretty sure now , as the decade has moved on , we are looking over our shoulder and realizing that the competition is gaining . So we need to make this investment in research and development to stay competitive , to grow jobs for tomorrow , and solve some of our most pressing problems , whether that is climate change , national security on cyber issues , or the advent and usage of artificial intelligence and what that will mean both for our opportunities and for our challenges . So we are making a renewed commitment to the National Science Foundation . I thank my colleagues again , Senator Schumer and Senator Young , for [ [ Page S3975 ] ] their innovative legislation . They are telling us a couple of things . They are saying , one , invest more money in research and development , so this bill not only increases the NSF budget , it increases DOE 's budget and increases the Defense Advanced Research Program Agency 's funding as well by $ 17.5 billion . So it is saying , yes , basic research is still very important . But it is also saying , for the first time , we need to get more out of the research that we do , and we need to have more translational science , that is , taking the basic research and applied research and actually using the applications of that in a more robust way so that we can translate more of that into actual science and manufacturing . Why is this so important ? Because we know that our competitiveness as a nation is suffering from the fact that people are looking at our own research and development . They are looking at our teachings and our publishing at universities and actually going and implementing this . So we need to do better on tech transfer . This underlying legislation not only helps us do that by helping to help universities who are our No . 1 research partner with Federal dollars , it allows those universities to help us with more tech transfer in innovative ways , that universities not just do the research , but help commercialize it . It also makes investments and helping them protect the patenting of that critical information , so no longer having that patentable information used in other places around the globe , but actually capitalizing on the jobs here in the United States . It also makes a huge investment in STEM , the science , technology , engineering , and math jobs that we need for the future . And clearly , you ca n't make a major investment in research and development if you do n't have the workforce to carry it out . And we need a workforce to carry it out . So this underlying legislation helps us not only diversify our workforce by a major investment in STEM , going from an annual budget of about $ 1 billion in the year 2020 to about $ 4 billion a year by 2026 . So we are going to get a more diversified STEM workforce with women and minorities participating . And we are also trying to distribute more of our engineering and science capacity around the United States . Our colleagues , Senators Schumer and Young , were adamant that we also look at innovation infrastructure happening in more regional places in the United States , where they may not currently have the R & D capability of some of our major institutions . So this legislation promises 20 percent of the research and investment dollars go to those EPSCoR states , Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research , an already identified landmark in how we distribute research dollars , that tries to grow the regional research infrastructure in more places in the United States . Again , I thank my colleagues Senator Wicker for leading the charge on that and helping us make that investment . And it also triples the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program , so that we get more out of manufacturing workforce training and resiliency of our supply chain for the future . As I mentioned before we left , it also includes an authorization for NASA and the Artemis mission and making sure that we are staying competitive . As Senator Nelson said in a House hearing on our mission and challenges , as China has made it clear , they are going to Mars , we are going back to the Moon to ready ourselves to go to Mars , and we think that it , too , deserves the funding and support to make us competitive . I think the bottom line here is that we know that American innovation drives the economy of the future . In a lot of ways , in passing this legislation today -- and just so our colleagues know , we will have a couple of votes here before we get to a final passage -- we really are doing our part . People hopefully will support this legislation enthusiastically , well past the majority of Members , because you believe in the history of the United States research and development that we have achieved innovation goals -- whether that was what we did with the internet , whether that was what we have done on biosciences , even on some of our issues as it relates to energy . We have achieved big breakthroughs . So today 's vote is about investing in that innovation economy of the future . I am pretty confident because I have met some of these innovators across the United States . I do n't know if everything that we have done so far will be absorbed by universities , our researchers , and our labs , but literally , we are trying to dust off R & D skills and make them more competitive for today . I guarantee you , though , these dollars that reach American entrepreneurs , who reach American innovators , they are ready and willing to take up this challenge . Give them those collaborative research resources through innovation at universities , through tech hubs , through more collaboration on workforce training , through investments in semiconductors , and I guarantee you these entrepreneurs in America will innovate our economy and create the economies of the future . And what is at stake ? If my colleagues have a better idea , I am willing to hear it . But I know this : Americans want us to lead on their regional economies , on the U.S. economies , and on global economies . They do not want to get left behind . They look at this time and era as a challenge to the leadership we have provided in the past . So settling for Federal investment being near their lowest point as a percentage of GDP in 60 years wo n't cut it . What cuts it is making an investment in R & D and empowering those entrepreneurs so they will create those future economies . I yield the floor . "

      "Ms. CANTWELL . Mr. President , I come to the floor today to continue our discussion about the Endless Frontier Act and why America needs to make more investment in the areas of research and development for our Nation . This is critically important as we have gone through this debate with some of our colleagues , to talk about why this is important for the United States . I spent my time yesterday -- maybe somebody from the staff can come over and help me with the charts but , thank you -- the biggest reason we are doing this is because we believe in American know-how , that is we believe in American ingenuity and we believe in American know-how and we have discussed already how that has helped to build our country over and over and over again , that we are a nation of , if you will , explorers , of pioneers , and by necessity , inventors , and that has continued throughout the history of our country . So we are so proud to continue to make these investments in all areas of science , certainly in the areas of healthcare , but we are more specifically talking about the engineers of the physical science and engineering . And we are talking about why we should make an increase in both basic research with this underlying bill that continues to drive dollars into curiosity driven early stage research , so that we can continue to grow jobs and help our economy , and it also continues the effort by saying we should make more investments in STEM education , so the workforce that it will take for us to meet the job challenges of the future . So we are excited that we are there with American know-how , but we are also cognizant of this international debate that is going on , the debate about other countries and what they are investing in research and development . And one of the reasons why I like where we are in the United States is because our research and development ecosystem is really an ecosystem of many different agencies doing research and development . And not only are those research and development investments by these various agencies helping in particular areas -- because it is really distributed as this chart shows , the United States works with the private sector , it works with our public universities , and it works with various agencies . Instead of a centralized approach that you might find in other countries , the fact that we have this distributed ecosystem with , you know , the Department of Energy may collaborate with the Department of Agriculture , they may collaborate with the Department of Defense , NSF may collaborate with universities , universities may collaborate with the private sector -- it is an ecosystem , and that ecosystem is what is unique about research and development in the United States . It is not hierarchical , it is not the majority driven by the private sector , or by government , it is an ecosystem , and the fact that it is so distributed . That means , almost like the competition in various places , and the collaboration is helping us grow the innovation economy . So the one thing that we need to be cognizant of in this debate is that we want to preserve that . We want to preserve the uniqueness of our ecosystem . And that is why we are really talking today about this NSF , the National Science Foundation , principally , and you can see from this big pie we just had this debate , right , we had this debate , well , let 's increase the defense R & D -- well , we are already doing a lot in defense R & D , of course , our colleagues are talking about the budget overall as it related to defense , but you can see that NSF , the numbers that they are at today at 6.8 are not really at the -- you know , you might think this whole debate we are spending , you know , billions of dollars to change the focus . This agency is a powerhouse , and it is a powerhouse mostly connected with universities , and the R & D that is done there has been in the basic research area . But now , this bill by our colleagues Senators Schumer and Young is about taking the basic research , continuing that , making a little bit of investment in that basic research , but then also now trying to accelerate all the research that we now have at our hands , our fingertips , at our minds , and saying , What other user-based research can we take , that basic and applied research , and actually put it into use in commercialization in the United States ? So if you will , capitalizing on a faster tech transfer and a faster deployment of these technologies -- why is this so important ? Well , it is important because , in the information age , a lot of people can read our published research and development , they can read what we are doing , and they can continue their research and development . Other nations are figuring out that research and development in an information age economy really does matter . They are figuring out that the United States has come a long way as a nation in building job growth , maintaining competitiveness , national security issues , all because we at the Federal Government level have said we believe in research and development with the public taxpayer dollars and it has benefited , whether it is the internet or the bio sciences and healthcare or on national security , the American public gets that that research has made us competitive as a nation . So we have had two previous attempts to make investments in this issue in America COMPETES , first started in the Bush administration in [ [ Page S3184 ] ] 2006 when President Bush published a report about America 's competitiveness and proposed this concept of that small NSF budget that I was referring to , and articulated that we needed to double that budget within a 5-year or 7-year window of time . They felt that , with the level of change and transformation and innovation , that we would n't be keeping pace on a global basis unless we made that investment . So in 2007 we passed the America COMPETES Act which gave money both to NSF and to DOE , and literally the first 3 years , we thought we were going to double this DOE budget and an investment in DOE within 7 years . So there was a little good news , a lot of euphoria in R & D , a lot of hope for STEM education , science , technology , engineering , and math . And then , in America COMPETES , the same request basically of a 60/40 split between NSF and energy , people thought we would end up -- well , we are not on pace , where we want to be , but , oh , we will get there within 11 years . Well , we will put enough money into this innovation effort that we will double our research and innovation budget as it relates to NSF and our energy innovation efforts in 11 years . Well , this is what really happened . We did n't do either of those things . We are really on a track to have taken those 2007 numbers and double them in 22 years . So when you look back at the history and you say , Well , how did we -- what happened ? If we are so enthusiastic about this , if we identify this -- both a Republican President identified this and then a Democratic administration followed up , why did n't we execute on this ? Why did n't we execute on this doubling of this number and making this investment ? Well , we all know what happened , we basically hit a recession . And in a recession of 2009 and 2010 , we just did n't live up to this obligation of funding the research and development that was in America COMPETES to the aggressiveness that we had all hoped for . I am not sure everybody even realizes that this effort fell short , that we did n't make quite the level of investment that we wanted , that we were falling behind . I do n't think anybody really understood it until now , when people see the incredible level of international competition . All of a sudden , as we see this incredible investment from the international community , people are starting to say , Well wait , what have we done on this effort ? So our next chart shows the fact that the United States has been a leader in global research and development , and as I said , I mentioned on the floor a report that was done by the Pew Charitable Trust -- I mean the Pew Research Center , that basically said 7 in 10 Americans believe in public investment in research and development . We have a higher regard for this than other nations , and we just do , I think , because people get it here , I think they get that we have invented a lot of things , they believe in that innovation , they know it creates jobs . And so we have a higher regard for that , and consequently , we have been the leader in world R & D for a very , very long time . But as this Information age has come along , other nations get that R & D leads to job creation , transformation , and certainly to security . So just since 1991 , we have seen China who was ninth in R & D -- now , they are No . 2 , and I am pretty sure , at current trajectories , will end up being No . 1 sometime very , very soon . And so it is , you know , not everything about China , although many of my colleagues here are going to discuss this is a China bill , I view it as a bill about the future and making the investments in the future to capture the economic opportunities . There are security issues here , clearly national security issues here . There are clearly issues about a supply chain and whether you can depend on a supply chain and whether , if you have a concentration of an industry in one region of the world , then are you really dependent on that one region of the world for that particular product ? What happened to all of us in the last year and a half -- and I am saying now on a global basis -- is the world community realized with COVID , well , wait , supply chains really matter , product really matters , where we get product in an emergency really matters , whether it does what it says it does in an emergency really matters . And so all of these issues about supply chains and who is building what and the intricacies of it really got ripped open in the COVID debate , and now , we are really , as the world community starts to look at this too , where do we get our product , who is making it , is it made to the standard that we want , is it secure ? And obviously , you know , people have made lots of decisions about supply chain based on just pure cost and effectiveness of a product , but now , people are starting to realize that it is way more complex , and it has led us to this current debate . So again , why do we do this , why does America want to make an investment in an innovation economy ? Well , we do n't have to go too far to understand that from our past history . It enables competitiveness , and if you just think about , you know these sectors-I will never forget years ago we had somebody -- this was in the '80s , visit Seattle , and they said , Well , what is everybody going to do , make car phones and computers ? And in reality , there was a big decade or so of making what then was supposed to be great technology of a car phone , and obviously , we all know where we have now been with computers and operating systems and how much it drives the economy of the future , but at the time when we were seeing a transformation to that , people just thought , Well , what are we all going to do ? Is that what we are going to do ? Well , telecommunication , semiconductors , advanced materials , all were huge things that enabled this competitiveness of our Nation-in automobiles , in aviation , in the tech sector , in healthcare , in a whole variety of things . And it drives our economy with this level of innovation . The internet , just one example , is something we started working on in the '60s , became a reality in the '90s , and today , it is $ 2.3 trillion part of our national economy , and 12 percent of U.S. GDP . That is what we got out of previous research . That is what we got out of saying we are going to let scientists do basic research and figure out what they think are the most important advances moving forward . The job growth , millions of jobs , and national security today , we can see just from this past week in a pipeline that was affected by a cyber attack , we can not afford to take our foot off of national security research and development in the purposes of things like cyber security . We have to continue to be a leader in this area of technology . It is not as if you are not going to have intimidation of our Nation by somebody maybe sticking the nose of a foreign sub in U.S. waters or flying a spy plane over the United States , it is going to come in the form of intimidation of our banking system , or pipelines , or other senses of security and hacking . And so there is no doubt -- no doubt -- we need to stay on top of the level of investment in national security . I would say the underlying bill that we will be talking about next week in detail relates to a very important aspect of national security , and that is the area of semiconductors . We need to make an investment in our competitiveness in semiconductors , and we need to make that investment because it is going to be critical to our national security . So let me talk about a few things that are in the bill , just so people understand some of the priorities that Majority Leader Schumer and Senator Young came up with as it relates to this legislation . As I mentioned , it creates a new Tech Directorate in the office of NSF , the National Science Foundation , so that it will be like a DARPA system , that is , that they work with the private sector , they create technology centers , they build partnerships between government and academia , they support rapid technology demonstration , they advance the competitiveness of the United States in important fields like artificial intelligence quantum computing , biotechnology , and they focus on these ideas , similar to how DARPA has done , where the individuals involved are critical to the effort , that is to say , to get the best and brightest minds who are working in these areas to be part of this effort and concentration . We also looked at and improved in this legislation the fact that universities and academia provide a lot of research and development , but oftentimes , do n't even -- in the academia world , people are focused on publishing . Publishing their research , that [ [ Page S3185 ] ] is kind of how they get known , that is what they get basically almost rewarded for at the university system , and you will be surprised how little time they take to actually take that research , turn it into a patent , and then turn it into a commercialized product . So one thing we heard in our hearings is that we needed to give more help to universities on tech transfer and patenting of information . Why patenting ? Because patenting helps us protect the science that we already have developed . It helps us -- say that somebody ca n't just take that published science report and then go off in another country and develop it because it is now protected under our U.S. law . So we feel this is a very important effort , and we think that it also helps lead a lot of research at universities to then be supported , developed , exposed to the venture capital markets and thus actually helped turn into commercialization . So efforts at the University of Washington that specifically focused on this , specifically hired somebody to come into the university and kind of , if you will , shake the tree of the level of R & D that was being done and say , What are we doing to actually patent this content , what are we doing to actually transfer it into commercialization , had outstanding results ? Yes , it was a transformation of what our universities do , but in the end , they came up with something like , just in a few years , 20 companies that ended up becoming been , you know , supported by venture capitalists and making it on to the markets . So we are very excited that we will now , with this provision , be trying to get more out of the research we do , by patenting it and doing tech transfer . Our colleagues Senators Young and Schumer also believe that university research should continue to get investments , and that is the major aspect of the provision here is to have the Tech Directorate work on these 10 areas of expertise , work with selected universities around the United States on this critical focus of technology . I mentioned some of them : artificial intelligence , quantum computing , biotechnology , and many others . So the fact that the bill really is depending on our university system , I think , is something that our colleagues should applaud and be excited about . That chart that I showed at the beginning where everybody is working together , this is just research dollars going to the best universities in our Nation to continue to focus on this , but now focus on it in partnership with experts in these sectors and with industry so that we can actually get to a faster adoption rate and a faster implementation into commercial markets . So I think we are leaning in to our university system . That is a good idea . That is a good idea . What we are giving the university system , though , is the tools , the tools to help accelerate that development . And then , as I mentioned , we are also making a huge investment in STEM , more than $ 10 billion into STEM education . The chart I showed before talked about how we were going to do all these great things under America COMPETES in STEM . We did n't quite get there . We did n't really do that . I think this is like broadband . Everybody talks about it all the time , we think we have solved it five times , and you still think , Wait , I thought we solved broadband ? STEM is the same thing . You think we have funded STEM . We have n't funded STEM . This represents a huge increase in our STEM education budget , but I will just tell you , this is so that we can get the researchers , the scientists , the fellows , if you will , at the higher education level for STEM . We still need to go and build the pipeline at our K-12 system so that we are putting more people into the pipeline . But hopefully , with the STEM dollars here , we will be , if you will , creating a new workforce for the innovation that we are trying to chase with the investments of these dollars . And we felt so strongly about this that we looked at the numbers and we were just astonished . There are so few women and minorities in STEM fields -- so few . The underlying bill our colleagues , Senator Schumer and Young , created a diversity office at , for the first time , over at NSF so they can focus on this issue . We put more resources to it within this STEM category so our colleagues and those at NSF could focus on it . And we expect to really try to take a very aggressive role here . That is what we heard from NSF in their research . STEM education ca n't be a passive thing . It ca n't be just , We are going to put some more dollars out for education . If we want to diversify in the sciences , we have to have a very , very aggressive approach . And so that aggressive approach means changing the faces of those who do the education , changing some of the faces of people who do investments , changing the dynamics of research . A lot of women were hurt in the last COVID pandemic who were researchers because they were juggling both taking care of their families or taking care of parents and doing their research . And so they had extra strains on them that made complexity to when they could get their research done . So we know we have to think about STEM education from the perspective of what are some of the challenges that face people going into those fields . But no doubt , this underlying legislation before us will have a big investment in that and continue NSF 's leadership in trying to grow a more aggressive workforce . So the bill also includes , I should say , a few things about how one of our goals is to diversify innovation to many different parts of the United States . The challenge there is , you know , you are not going to sprinkle some dust on some magic words on some region of the United States , and all of a sudden , something is going to pop up-and nor do I personally expect it to . I always give the example of Walla Walla , which is a real place , Walla Walla , WA . I had a journalist ask once if that was a real place . Yes , it is a real place . It is a great wine-making place . But somebody might say , Walla Walla , WA , should be a research center . It has got a university , an outstanding university , Whitman . People might say it should be a tech hub or it should be a research center . Walla Walla found its rightful place when research was done , and a university professor at the University of Washington said , You know what , we can grow wine grapes . That really was n't that long ago . That was in the 1980s . He said we can grow grapes . We were n't growing grapes . Now , a couple of decades later , we have over a thousand wineries in the State of Washington . So not everybody is going to be a tech hub , but it does n't mean that you 're not going to use science to the best and highest use for a region of your State or the country . It is about empowering . As Director Panchanathan , the head of NSF says , it is about trying to have innovation everywhere , connected to opportunity everywhere , connected to universities . The point is let 's build a better ecosystem that goes all throughout the United States so more and more people can take advantage of technology and innovation . So this is really , really important because we never know where the next person is going to come from , who is going to play a critical role in technology . And the more we build this infrastructure , the better . So this allows money for regional technology hubs to help concentrate in various parts of the country and expertise , more money for our manufacturing institutes which help manufacturers all across the United States focus on being competitive in their particular area , and it supports $ 2.4 billion for manufacturing extension programs , which are those things that really do work with , say , a particular sector like automobiles or aviation or some other type of manufacturing and help make them competitive . And as mentioned , it also , just like in the former COMPETES Act bills , puts some money into DOE . In this case , it puts about $ 17 billion into the Department of Energy so that its energy innovation can move forward . So let me talk for a second about this issue about national security and where we are with semiconductors because I expect this will get a bunch of focus next week as we talk about this legislation . The underlying bill has about $ 52 billion of investment for the semiconductor industry , so I am pretty sure people think , Well , wait , this is a lot of money , but it is a very big sector . It is essential to our defense , it is essential to navigation , it is essential to [ [ Page S3186 ] ] satellites , it is essential to healthcare , it is essential to consumer products . And the United States has been a leader in this area . The United States has been a leader in this area for a long time -- or I should say , was a leader in this area for a long time , when you think of companies like Intel or others , even some of the companies that are foreign investors who made huge footprints in the United States . But the point is that we are no longer in this position -- as this chart shows , only 12 percent of a global supply . A report recently done on the semiconductor industry by Boston Consulting Group , I just want to read this one part : `` The U.S. has been the long-standing global leader in semiconductors with 45 % to 50 % share of the worldwide market '' -- 45-percent to 50-percent share of the worldwide market -- `` in the last 30 years . However , significant focus is being placed on ending the U.S. share in semiconductor manufacturing which now only stands at 12 % installed capacity . '' This is a report that I am pretty sure you could get online . That is the end of that statement . So we have gone from 45 percent to 50 percent , that is where we started out , and over the last 30 years , now , we are down to 12 percent -- 12 percent . So I ask my colleagues , if you were 12 percent of anything , how long would you be around to be competitive ? How long would you drive the supply chain ? How long would you drive job growth ? How long would you continue to be competitive in this very , very important sector that is important to all of these things ? And while I am somebody who supports continued growth of our global economy because I think we build and make great things and we want people to sell them to , this presents to us a very unique challenge , the fact that something as critical to the information age as semiconductors , we have gone from 40 percent to 50 percent down to 12 percent the question is what is going to happen next . Well , the question of what is going to happen next is , if we do n't make this investment , very , very likely that that 12 percent is going to , in the next several years , turn into 6 percent . It is going to turn into 6 percent . So staying status quo right now , doing no investment , it is very likely that 12 percent will turn into 6 percent , which means people are n't going to want to locate their boundaries in the United States . People are n't going to want to locate their research in the United States -- people are n't going to want to have their companies and the supply chain and the workforce . Literally , this industry simply is clusters , it is clusters . Seattle did n't get to be Seattle overnight . Seattle did n't get to be the hub of the No . 1 STEM city in the United States of America and certainly an epicenter of software and software development overnight . It took decades -- decades . Literally , you know , even in the 1980s and 1990s , it was n't that diversified . It has just been in the last 15 years that it has really diversified . But , yes , it took the work of the University of Washington . Yes , it took the work of many companies being there . Then it took the work of then people attracting a workforce who would rather be there than , say , in Silicon Valley . And then it took the efforts of universities to produce a workforce . Then it took attracting venture capital . Then once they got venture capital , then more companies wanted to come there because then you have the entire ecosystem . You had universities , you had venture capital , you had leading companies , you had a workforce , and you had all of this stuff . Well , that is in software , and software can continue to move forward , but if you did n't have those things , you are n't going to be a cluster for semiconductors . The United States of America -- the cluster of semiconductor development is going to be in Asia . It is going to be in Korea . It is going to be in Taiwan , and it is going to be in China . So we have to ask ourselves if we are only 6 percent of the supply in the future and we ca n't really control the development and we lose our edge in this and then basically we have to rely on a supply chain for all the chips , you know , in the world , where is the supply chain that we are going to rely on for the national security products and defense technology and satellites and maybe some of these other consumer products that then end up getting used for other purposes ? That is what this debate is about . It is about that we went from 45 percent to 50 percent down to 12 percent . If we do nothing , we are going to 6 percent , and the epicenter of a critical technology is going to move to Asia . So I personally want to see us be successful in keeping a sector in the United States . I am very proud that that same Boston report shows that we have 49 percent of the aerospace manufacturing market in the United States . I am very proud of that because we are an epicenter of that . Forty-nine percent of the manufacturing market for aerospace is in the United States . That represents , to my region , maybe 150,000 to 200,000 jobs in the Northwest . To the United States , that is 2 million jobs -- more than 2 million probably if you think about some of the other related sectors . So being 49 percent of the supply chain in the United States for aerospace really , really , really matters . And I do n't want to see that slip . You know , we have had a discussion about the fact that we have the Jones Act . Now , some of our colleagues might not support the Jones Act , but the Jones Act is we decide , Well , we are not going to be all the shipbuilding in the world . Shipbuilding is going to get built in other places . But , oh , my gosh , we have to have enough shipbuilding in the United States so if we are at war , products and services that we need to support our military can be transported on U.S. vessels . That is why we have the Jones Act because we decided that that sector was critical enough to support . And what we are saying here is that this sector is critical enough to support , too . I do n't know that we are ever going to be 49 percent like aerospace manufacturing is -- probably not , probably because it would take a lot more money than we are talking about here -- because the rest of this world is chasing this market , too . They are chasing it fast and furious . We have to ask ourselves , Do we want to end up at 6 percent , or are we want going to try to reverse this trend and make an investment and make it as smart as possible ? I thought we had one more chart , but I guess we do n't . So I guess we are back to this . Is this bill 's investment worth taking the chance on American know-how ? Is it worth the history of our country and saying , We have done a lot in research and development , and we know how to get things done . When I think of some of the people in this story , I think one of the guys on the GI Bill was one of the first contributors to semiconductors . It is a guy who basically went to school on a GI Bill , and if you think about the capital formation and capital markets we have in the United States , it has contributed to allowing that technology to move more rapidly . Our investment in higher education has allowed this to move more rapidly . So to my colleagues who are n't sure about this legislation or think that it sounds like a lot or thinks that it sounds like , Oh , I do n't understand it , it is really quite simple . Do you want to make a bigger investment in our contribution to American know-how with research and development and let them compete to winning the next generation of jobs ? I do . I do . I want to do that because I want to see what comes next . I think it is one of the most exciting things about today and where we live today . We are not in the agrarian age ; we are not in the industrial age . We are in the information age where everything can be created in the blink of an eye and now distributed and transform our economy in such significant ways . I want to see what comes next . But we ca n't do it by passing legislation , authorizing things and then not appropriating the money and then waking up in 10 years and finding that we are at the lowest percentage of research and development to GDP in 60 years . That is where we are , the lowest percentage . So we ca n't do that . We have to make these investments and if we invest in American know-how , the rest of this will take care of itself . I yield the floor . "

      "Mr. DURBIN . Mr. President , last week , China announced that it would now allow families to have three children -- a profound shift from their previous one- and two-child policies . Why the change ? China looked to the future and realized that its population policies would hamper economic growth . Now , the U.S. Government will never tell families how many children to have . That choice is profoundly personal . Yet we must ask ourselves the same questions China is asking : What kind of changes will lead or deter the United States from a future of economic growth and prosperity ? How can we enhance America 's competitiveness ? And more than just compete , how can we make sure America comes in first ? [ [ Page S3978 ] ] The answer is obvious : Invest in American creativity . China is investing heavily in electric vehicles , critical minerals , energy production , computer chips -- the list goes on . In all of these areas , China is beginning to pull ahead of the pack . They are aiming for first . And what underscores all of their efforts ? Research . Every breakthrough , every new technology , every scientific step forward opens new markets and drives their economy into the future at high speed . Unfortunately , it is a different story in America . For decades , in both the public and private sectors , we have downsized our discovery and innovation investments . Since the days of the space race , we have stepped away from the great challenge of discovery . If we were to commit the same percentage of our national budget to research today as we did in the Apollo era , we would invest $ 900 billion over 5 years . That kind of an investment puts people on the Moon . That kind of investment puts us in first . So how do we get there ? The U.S . Innovation and Competition Act would set us back on track and at a fraction of the cost of Apollo-era spending . As we debate and hopefully pass this bill , we must keep asking : What are we willing to do to be No . 1 ? One important way we can compete with countries like China is by increasing support for domestic manufacturing and strengthening our domestic supply chains . The legislation before us does exactly that . It provides $ 52 billion in emergency funding to boost our domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities . In 1990 , the United States produced 37 percent of the world 's semiconductors , but today , just 12 percent of semiconductors are manufactured in the United States . Now , we are facing a global shortage of microchips , which is impacting jobs in my State and many others . I am proud that Illinois has long been a leader in auto manufacturing , thanks to dedicated workers like those at a Stellantis plant in Belvidere , IL , who assemble Jeep Cherokees . Unfortunately , that plant was forced to shut down in March due to the global shortage of semiconductors . And last month , Stellantis announced that as many as 1,640 employees at the plant could be laid off in July -- again , because it does not have enough microchips . After briefly resuming operations last week , the plant already has had to shut down again for 2 weeks because of this shortage . Last week , I spoke to representatives from Stellantis who shared that the U.S . Innovation and Competition Act could make a real difference in terms of boosting supply of these chips . This funding is not just important for the assembly plant in Belvidere . Sadly , we are seeing similar impacts of the semiconductor shortage at Ford 's Chicago Assembly Plant , which supports 5,800 jobs . That plant was idled through April , with shutdowns extended into May . We urgently need to act to address this global microchip shortage to provide certainty to the workers whose livelihoods depend on a stable supply of semiconductors . The legislation before us will not only address our immediate market needs but it will also help prevent these shortages again the future . This investment supports jobs across the entire supply chain , from construction of new facilities , to manufacturing and development of chips , to workers in the auto industry who depend on a reliable supply of semiconductors , to American consumers . The U.S . Innovation and Competition Act is the result of weeks of negotiation and bipartisan work . I was puzzled by some of my Republican colleagues ' arguments for voting against cloture on this bill . If you do n't want China 's products and values to dominate the global marketplace , why would you cede that marketplace to China -- or anyone else , for that matter ? If you believe in America 's products , values , and most of all , its people , then do the smart thing : Invest in them . Although some of my colleagues seem to believe otherwise , invective is n't going to win this global competition . We need investment to remain No . 1 . No one bill will secure America 's economic prosperity or national security or resolve all of the outstanding issues in our relationship with China , but strengthening America 's role as a global leader in science and technology is an essential piece of our effort to preserving American leadership in this world . So I put it to my fellow Senators : Let 's take a step forward today . Let 's invest in the research , the jobs , and the future that all Americans deserve . I plan to vote in favor of the U.S . Innovation and Competition Act , and I urge my colleagues to do the same . Let 's not settle for second best . Let 's put America in the lead . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The Senator from Washington . Ms. CANTWELL . Mr. President , I ask unanimous consent that myself , Senator Cantwell , Senator Wicker , Senator Young , and Senator Schumer be allowed to speak before the vote . The PRESIDING OFFICER . Is there an objection ? Without objection , it is so ordered . Ms. CANTWELL . Mr. President , I just wanted to take a moment to thank , obviously , my colleagues , Senator Schumer and Senator Young , for their hard work on this legislation and thank my counterpart , Senator Wicker , for his tremendous effort in moving this bill . We have now been on this bill , and we reported it out May 12 . I think it came on the calendar May 13 , and , literally , we have been working on it since . So this is a very hard effort to produce something very important to today 's economy . So I want to thank Senator Schumer 's staff , Mike Lynch , Meghan Taira , Gerry Petrella ; and John Keast , Crystal Tully , Steven Wall , James Mazol , Cheri Pascoe of Senator Wicker 's office . On my team , David Strickland , Melissa Porter , and Mary Guenther . But , specifically , I want to thank Richard-Duane Chambers , who came to the Senate from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , I think , maybe like a week before we started working on this bill . So , literally , since he joined the Senate Commerce Committee , he has been just knee-deep in the conversation of dusting off our R & D for the Nation , making a new investment , making more translational science . So I really appreciate Richard-Duane 's effort . I also want to thank Gigi Slais , Shawn Bone , John Branscome , Ronce Almond , Alex Simpson , Jared Bomberg , Shannon Smith , John Beezer , Noam Kantor , Tiffany George , Jordan Blue , Kara Fischer , Nikky Teutschel , Matthew Bobbink , Caitlin Warner , Alex Kiles , George Greenwell , Elle Wibisono , Alexis Gutierrez , Eric Vryheid , Brian McDermott , Lucy Koch , Hunter Blackburn , and Alex Hall . So all of these people . I think my colleagues know that these bills do n't come about easily . They come through a lot of hard work . And we thank everybody for participating in a regular order process out here on the Senate floor to produce a bipartisan result for something so important to our Nation 's competitiveness . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The Senator from Mississippi . Mr. WICKER . Mr. President , I certainly rise in support of this legislation and urge a `` yes '' vote . This is an opportunity for the United States to strike a blow on behalf of answering the unfair competition that we are seeing from Communist China , and it is an opportunity to have a game changer in terms of geographic diversity in our research effort . This morning , the Armed Services Committee heard extensive testimony about the need to compete with China at the military level . This is an opportunity to compete with China at the research level . This bill will strengthen our country 's innovation in key technology fields of the future -- in areas such as artificial intelligence , robotics , quantum computing , and communications . And this bill also is a game changer in terms of giving universities all over the United States an opportunity to participate in game- changing research , which will help us compete . Universities , largely in smaller States such as mine , have been left behind in the past . They will finally , under this legislation , have an opportunity to participate in research at a meaningful level -- so two good reasons to vote yes . The distinguished chair of the committee has been gracious in thanking all of our staffs on the majority and the minority side . I appreciate her doing that , as well as Senator Cantwell 's admirable job of managing this bill through the committee . I congratulate the two authors of this bill , Senator Schumer and Senator [ [ Page S3979 ] ] Young , who sponsored this legislation . This bill is headed toward passage with a fine bipartisan vote , and I am pleased to support passage . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The Senator from Indiana . Mr. YOUNG . Mr. President , I want to begin by thanking my colleagues : Senator Schumer , Senator Wicker , and Senator Cantwell . All showed exceptional leadership over the course of drafting this legislation and ensuring that it made it through the process . I also want to thank members of my team : Lauren O'Brien , my legislative director ; Brandt Anderson , my national security adviser ; Dan Cheever ; Nancy Martinez , on my ledge staff . They went above and beyond . So this piece of legislation , yes , it , indeed , is related to countering the threat that the Chinese Communist Party presents to this country . But it also is a piece of legislation that we are considering at a time when so many of our citizens feel overlooked , when the intimate communities that they call home feel hollowed out , when trust in our civic institutions is eroding , and when allegiance seems increasingly to our political tribes and not to one another on behalf of the common good . So let 's not kid ourselves . The Chinese Communist Party aims to exploit all of these divisions . They aim to exploit the insecurities of the global age . They aim to ensure that their power and their capabilities continue to grow . And they are , indeed , locked in a global competition with the United States of America and with our partners and allies . So let 's do what we have always done as Americans in times like this . Let 's come together , and let 's use this as an opportunity to become a better version of ourselves . I will end with this . When generation after generation of immigrants have come into the New York Harbor , they have seen that beautiful Statue of Liberty . And at the base of the Statue of Liberty is a sonnet , and everyone here in this Chamber and so many across America are familiar with the words of that sonnet : `` Give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses . . . `` There is also a line in there that I particularly love about `` imprisoned lightning '' -- `` imprisoned lightning . '' I am not sure what Emma Lazarus meant by the phrase `` imprisoned lightning , '' but to me that `` imprisoned lightning '' refers to the untapped potential , the God-given potential of every human being . And this legislation , the Endless Frontier Act , aims to tap into that `` imprisoned lightning '' of people across the heartland to ensure that they can stay part of the economic game in the 21st century and that they help us outcompete , outinnovate , and outgrow the Chinese Communist Party . We will win . We are going to get a great vote today , and I thank all of my colleagues for their intention to support this legislation . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The majority leader . Mr. SCHUMER . Mr. President , first , I , too , would like to thank Senators Cantwell and Wicker for an amazing , bipartisan job ; and Senators Menendez and Risch , another great bipartisan contribution . All the Members -- just about every Member has contributed to this bill . I do want to single out two of my staff members who just slaved over this bill relentlessly , and that is Mike Kuiken and Jon Cardinal . Mike is there . I do n't know if Jon is here . But they deserve tremendous kudos for what they did . Without them I do n't think we would have had a bill , to be honest with you -- and everybody else , all the other staffs who worked so hard . Now , this is a quote from Dr. Vannevar Bush : `` Without scientific progress , no amount of achievement in other directions can insure our health , prosperity , and security in the modern world . '' That was Dr. Vannevar Bush , the head of the U.S. Office of Scientific Research , writing in 1945 . His report to President Truman was titled : `` Science -- The Endless Frontier '' -- an inspiration to the legislation we considered today . In the wake of Dr. Bush 's report , we created the National Science Foundation . We funded the National Laboratories . We split the atom . We spliced the gene . We landed a man on the Moon . We unleashed the internet . We generated 75 years of American prosperity and fostered an innate sense of optimism in the American spirit . We face a challenge now -- in this century -- to replicate the success of the previous one . But the Federal Government 's commitment to science , unfortunately , has waned . As a percentage of GDP , we spend less than half as much as the Chinese Communist Party on basic research . We rely on foreign nations to supply critical technologies that we invented , like semiconductors . That sunny American optimism has flickered as well . The world is more competitive now than at any time since the end of the Second World War . If we do nothing , our days as the dominant superpower may be ending . We do n't mean to let those days end on our watch . We do n't mean to see America become a middling nation in this century . We mean for America to lead it . Passing this bill -- now called the U.S . Innovation and Competition Act -- is the moment when the Senate lays the foundation for another century of American leadership . Let me say that again . This bill could be the turning point for American leadership in the 21st century , and for that reason , this legislation will go down as one of the most significant bipartisan achievements of the U.S. Senate in recent history . Around the globe , authoritarian governments believe that squabbling democracies like ours ca n't unite around national priorities . They believe that democracy itself is a relic of the past and that by beating us to emerging technologies , they -- many of the meritocracies -- will be able to reshape the world in their own image . Well , let me tell you something . I believe they are wrong . I believe that this legislation will enable the United States to outinnovate , outproduce , and outcompete the world in the industries of the future . I believe that the strongly bipartisan work on this bill has revealed that in this Chamber , we all believe that another American century lies on the horizon . I urge my colleagues to vote yes . I yield the floor . "

      "Mr. SASSE . Mr. President , I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded . The PRESIDING OFFICER . Without objection , it is so ordered . S. 1260 Mr. SASSE . Mr. President , Winston Churchill is often credited with the apocryphal quote that `` we sleep soundly in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm . '' This is still true , but the 21st century has gotten more complicated . We live in an era of hybrid wars . There are fewer D-days on enemy beaches and more zero-day exploits in enemy servers . Americans sleep soundly at night because , in addition to these rough men at the ready , brilliant men and women work around the clock to develop national security technology that defends our interests and undermines our enemies . DARPA -- the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency -- is on the frontlines of that work . They are racing against our adversaries . Our technology struggle against the Chinese Communist Party is the defining national security challenge of our time . Chairman Xi and his techno-authoritarian regime are fundamentally opposed to not just American values but American interests all around the globe . Our citizens watching this Chamber on most days might think that most of their political leaders are content to ignore this reality , but I assure my colleagues in this Chamber that the CCP is not asleep at the switch . Beijing is aggressively investing in machine learning and artificial intelligence and in quantum computing . They are hacking and stealing America 's research and America 's intellectual property . The Chinese Communist Party is on a mission , and they make no attempt to hide it . They want to become the world 's preeminent superpower , and they think that by claiming first-mover advantage in the cyber domain , they can achieve this . We ca n't let that happen . My amendment to today 's legislation is simple : It doubles DARPA 's budget , $ 3.5 billion to $ 7 billion a year for each of the next 5 years . The work of the National Science Foundation is important as well , and I support that work . I support that research . But the NSF 's research is broad . DARPA 's research is directly applied to our most critical national security challenges . Cutting-edge , classified tech development is in DARPA 's DNA . When we talk about identifying and disrupting the CCP 's AI-enabled cyber and information campaigns , we want DARPA to be leading that work . When we talk about developing new technological tools to push back on the CCP 's hybrid warfare , we want DARPA to be leading that work . If we want American democracy to outlast Chinese techno- authoritarianism , we can make this investment . Doubling DARPA 's budget is a cost-effective investment that bolsters that work , and it bolsters the work of the Endless Frontier legislation we are debating this week , and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this amendment . The PRESIDING OFFICER ( Mr. Lujan ) . The Senator from Florida . China Mr. RUBIO . Mr. President , a year ago Saturday , the previous administration , the Trump administration , launched something called Operation Warp Speed . At that time , it was a $ 10 billion program by the government , and it was designed to incentivize pharmaceutical companies to invest in developing , researching , and producing effective treatments and a vaccine for a disease that was ravaging and continues to ravage the world today . Less than 4 months later , a new antibody treatment was beginning to save American lives and improving the outcomes of patients with COVID- 19 here in America . And less than 7 months after that Operation Warp Speed program began , Americans began receiving the first dose of two different and highly effective vaccines . Why did the government have to step in ? Why did the government have to provide the money ? Would n't the market have solved this ? There was certainly a demand . There was certainly a need for it . In fact , I would argue that people probably would have paid whatever it took to get their hands on a vaccine and on new treatments given the level of desperation that existed in May of last year here and around the world . Yes , the market would have eventually developed the antivirals , would have developed the antibody treatments , and would have developed the vaccine . The market would have eventually done it without the government stepping in , in this dramatic way . But it would n't have done it in the timing that we needed it . We needed it right away . Our economy was shut down . Children were not going to school . Workers had no jobs . Small businesses were being wiped out . Hospitals were being overrun , and people were dying . We were facing a global crisis and a national emergency . It was a moment that required urgent attention and the fastest results possible . So for the common good of our country , our government partnered with the private sector to reach a targeted end , one that served the interest of our country and our people . In short , we pursued `` industrial policy '' and almost 1 year to the very day , it was announced that life in America is , slowly but steadily , returning to normal . I first spoke about the need for a 21st century American industrial policy well over a year before the pandemic hit . Let me tell you that for much of my adult life , much of the time I even paid attention to policy , `` industrial policy '' was generally sort of a dirty phrase for me . Politically , I was raised capitalist orthodox . It is an economic faith grounded in the belief of less taxes and less government and more freedom . I still believe in less taxes and less government and more freedom , and my faith in capitalism has only grown because , unlike socialism , the market always produces the most efficient outcome and , usually , generally , invariably , the result of that is prosperity and opportunity . The free market -- capitalism -- has eradicated more poverty than all the socialist programs in the world combined . [ [ Page S2559 ] ] But the market is agnostic . It does n't take into account the impact that an efficient outcome , a market outcome , would have on its people . Thus the market does not take into account its national interests . It is agnostic . We in public policy can not be agnostic . The job of those of us who serve in the American Government is to make decisions that are in the best interests of America and the people that we serve . I believe that , generally and invariably , that usually means supporting a vibrant system of free enterprise in which private businesses invest and innovate and produce , and government makes it easier for them to do that and gets out of the way . But what do we do , what should we do , when the market reaches the most efficient outcome and the most efficient outcome is one that is bad for America , bad for Americans , or does n't meet a crisis at hand fast enough ? What is our role when we face such a crisis , when we must address one that has to be addressed faster than the market 's ability to do it ? This is not a hypothetical question . It describes what we faced in May of last year , when Operation Warp Speed was announced , and it describes many of the important challenges we face today . Over the last 20 years -- maybe 25 years -- the market sent American factories and jobs to other countries . This was the most efficient decision to make because workers in other countries cost less , and so it lowered labor costs and increased profits . It was the market 's decision . It was the efficient decision , but it destroyed the jobs of Americans . It shattered families . It gutted once-vibrant communities . Major American corporations headquartered here in the United States -- multinationals -- have allowed China to steal trade secrets and cheat on trade because , for them , gaining access to even a small sliver of the growing Chinese market of over a billion people led to profits . This , indeed , did create short-term profits and extravagant wealth for some , but in the process it began transforming America from a country that invents and makes things into one that increasingly just finances and buys them . It is , indeed , more efficient to make the active ingredients in many of our medicines in China . It is cheaper to do it . So , today , we find ourselves depending on China to produce the active ingredients in everything from acetaminophen , which is generic for Tylenol , all the way to blood thinners and everything in between . It was cheaper to buy rare-earth minerals from China -- it still is -- than to produce and mine our own . Today , we depend on them for almost 90 percent of these valuable metals that are needed not just for advanced electronics but for our own major weapons systems . We made the decision to allow Chinese companies free rein to own and to buy and to make money in America , almost without restrictions , because we are capitalists They , on the other hand , restrict and ban our businesses from doing work in China because they are nationalists . None of this is an accident . China has a plan . It has a plan to overtake America as the world 's leading economic , technological , geopolitical , diplomatic , and military power . I do n't say this to you based on some supersecret intelligence document or an educated guess . They put it on paper . They have written this out for everyone to see in 2015 . The Chinese Communist Party laid out a plan with a title called `` Made in China 2025 . '' It basically is a plan to invest in and overtake us in 10 of the industries that will define the 21st century economy -- biomedicine , advanced technology , air and space , artificial intelligence , quantum computing , telecommunications , 5G , rail systems , ship building . They intend to lead the world in all of these areas , and they are executing on a plan to carry that out , and we have been complacent and distracted . So while China channels every element of their national power , every element that you can imagine -- while they channel all of it -- to dominate these key industries and to do it at our expense , we assume that our position in the world will continue on its own without having to do anything to maintain it . While China is pursuing economic and technological dominance , we find ourselves here busy canceling people , demanding the use of the right pronoun to describe people , or claiming that requiring a photo ID to vote is the return of a Jim Crow era . We have placed ourselves on the road of decline and humiliation , headed toward a world in which a totalitarian regime -- one guilty right now , as we speak , of committing genocide against Uighur Muslims -- becomes the leading power on the planet and relegating our country , America , into the status of a once great nation in decline . We do not need to abandon capitalism and embrace socialism to take on this challenge . I believe socialism would only accelerate the damage our decisions are doing to our country . We need capitalism , but it must be a capitalism geared toward promoting the national interest and the common good , where the private market drives our economic decisions . And in those instances where the market outcome is bad for our country , in those instances in which the market 's most efficient outcome is one that is bad for our people , for our national security , for our national interests , bad for America -- in those instances -- what we need is targeted industrial policy to further the common good and to protect our people , our country , and our future . We need an industrial policy targeted not to every industry or to the one who hires the right lobbyist . No , we need an industrial policy like Operation Warp Speed , targeted to urgent national needs ; policies like my Medical Manufacturing , Economic Development , and Sustainability Act , which would help bring back our ability to make medicines in this country again , including in places like Puerto Rico that need the economic growth and jobs ; like the CHIPS Act we passed last year to make sure we never have to depend on China or any other country , for that matter , for semiconductors . In 2019 , well before the pandemic , I proposed modernizing the Small Business Administration and aligning its programs to the national interest , like my American Innovation and Manufacturing Act , which would incentivize private investment in small American manufacturers through the SBA . And even as we make these sorts of targeted industrial policy decisions , we need to make sure that we are protecting them from being stolen from us . One of the changes we need to make in the China bill that is now before the Senate is we need to have stronger protections against the research that we are funding from being stolen . First , more of this money should be invested through agencies like DARPA , as an example , which has very good safeguards in place . Second , we should prohibit any entity from receiving the funds called for in this bill if they receive China-based financial or in-kind support , or if they otherwise failed to disclose foreign funding in the past 10 years . Third , we should require certification that a potential recipient of the funding has sufficient protections in place to guard against IP theft and other threats from foreign governments before they were giving them the money . It would be something if we appropriate all this money for industrial policy , we invest it , and then we see it stolen . Fourth , we should prohibit Federal employees and contractors from participating in any foreign government talent recruitment program , and we should require Federal contractors to disclose any commercial ties they might have to the Communist Party in China . And , fifth , we should establish a system of outbound investment screening . Even if we are successful in preventing adversarial actors from acquiring Federal research dollars or intellectual property developed by it , there is nothing to stop nationless corporations from simply buying the IP and using it to develop capacities to benefit China and hurt our interests . This is an important moment , I think , one that will define the remainder of the century . When the book about the 21st century is written , it will have a few chapters about a lot of different things . But that book is going to be about the relationship between China and the United States and what happened , and what happened is in very many ways being decided right now . [ [ Page S2560 ] ] We must ensure that our public policies are aligned to the urgent challenges of our time . Our job here is to promote the common good and to defend the national interest . By and large , that is a free enterprise , capitalist economy that will produce the innovation , the investments , and all of the things necessary to make that possible . Yet , in those instances in which a national need is urgent , in which the outcome that the market has delivered is harming our country and its long-term future , we have an obligation to act on the common good . We should not allow orthodoxy or policies that made a lot of sense in the 1980s -- a very different world from today -- to stand in the way of the sorts of targeted government-private partnerships needed : the kinds of partnerships that gave us a vaccine that is bringing us back to normal ; the kind of partnership that will allow us to tackle the challenges we face now so that the 21st century will ultimately be an American century and so that our leadership in these key industries that will define the century is neither endangered nor lost . I yield the floor . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The Senator from Texas . "

      "Mr. PAUL . Mr. President , we are currently $ 28 trillion in debt . Whose fault is it -- Republicans ? Democrats ? The answer is yes , yes on both fronts . Both parties are responsible for the debt , and one side is honest about it . One side will tell you they do n't give a fig about the debt : The debt be damned . We are for new monetary theories . Spend as much as you have got ; borrow as much as you can ; and somehow we are going to combat the influence of China by borrowing more money from China . It does n't really seem to make a lot of sense , but that is where we are . So we have before us a bill that will simply add to the debt . We will go further in debt . You might make the argument that we are actually less strong as a nation the more in debt we are . Where is the opposition ? Now , there is no opposition on one side of the [ [ Page S3916 ] ] aisle , and on the other side , there is feigned opposition . The Republicans will feign opposition to the debt . They will say : Well , yes , we care about the debt , and the other side spends too much and borrows too much . You will hear Republicans throughout the land campaigning against the debt , only to come to Washington and vote for most of the debt . So what we end up with is a $ 28 trillion debt . We actually borrow more in a month than we used to borrow in a year . In March of this year , we borrowed $ 660 billion in 1 month . The proposals for spending are alarming . We have spent and borrowed more in the last 2 years than we did during World War II . There are going to be repercussions of so much borrowing in such a short period of time . We are seeing a misallocation of capital throughout the economy . We are seeing a grossly inflated stock market . We are starting to see inflation throughout the supply chain throughout the economy . There are going to be repercussions . The question we have to ask ourselves is , Are we willing to look at the example of countries like Venezuela or Zimbabwe that completely destroyed their currencies ? People say that could n't happen in America . It largely has n't happened because we have been the reserve currency of the world . We have been fortunate . People describe it as having the cleanest shirt in a closet full of dirty shirts . The dollar is weakened by such extravagant spending . Yet people still cling to the dollar because the other currencies are weaker . This bill simply adds more to the debt . We say we are going to combat China through this bill , but we are going to combat China by increasing a Department of government -- the National Science Foundation -- that is actually , probably , one of the most wasteful Agencies in government . William Proxmire was a conservative Democrat from Wisconsin back in the sixties and seventies . He started an award called the Golden Fleece Award . One of the first Golden Fleece Awards William Proxmire gave was an award for a study about what makes people fall in love . You would think , with the lampooning through the years of the ridiculous lizards on treadmills and of Panamanian frogs , that , after a while , people would say : Instead of giving more money to this Agency that is so full of waste and ridiculous studies , we should give it less money . So , perhaps , if we wanted it to reform , we would say to the National Science Foundation : Instead of increasing your budget 68 percent , why do n't we reduce your budget 10 percent and say behave better . What if we were to reform how they pick their committees ? For example , if you want to study cocaine and if you want to study Japanese quail using cocaine and if you want to know if they are more sexually promiscuous , do you know how you would get approval for your funding ? You would call up your other buddies who study cocaine in animals and say : Hey , I have got this great , new study . Would you guys like to join in it and be my peer-review committee ? It is actually the ridiculous studies that we discover that are being voted on by people who are selected by the people who are doing the studies . What they do is they select other people with ridiculous studies , and they say : We will vote for yours if you will vote for mine . So how do we get $ 500,000 spent in studying Panamanian frogs ? They want to know whether or not the mating call of the country frogs in Panama is different than the mating call of the city frogs . Well , in coming from a rural State , I can tell you that the mating call of the country folk is always different than the mating call of the city folk . We could have polled the audience . Are quail more sexually promiscuous on cocaine ? I think we could have polled the audience . The thing is , there could be some reforms . For example , as much as I am opposed to government spending , there are some important diseases . Let 's say Alzheimer 's , cancer , diabetes , heart disease . Why would n't we make the committees for the National Science Foundation have someone on there from one of the big five diseases ? Why would n't we put a taxpayer advocate on there ? Why would n't we have some sort of inspector general process so that this does n't happen ? We have to review this . This is n't an academic point . We have now discovered that the NIH was funding the Wuhan lab . So we should have oversight on what happens , but after 50 years of abuse at the National Science Foundation , we are still studying will people eat ants to combat climate change . Seriously , that was a study . How many ants will people eat , and how many ants do you have to eat to reduce the global warming by 1 degree ? It is a lot of ants . The thing is , those are the kinds of studies that we are having coming out of here , and we do n't make it any better by increasing their budgets . If you are a wasteful Agency and we give you more money , we will get more waste . If you want less waste -- and this goes not only for this . It goes for the military . It goes for any other Agency of government . If you give any Agency more government money , you will get more waste . You wo n't get less . The cocaine was actually the NIH , not the NSF . The NIH has got some of the same problems . One of the ones from the NIH , in recent years , was $ 2 million to see , if someone in the buffet line in front of you -- when you are going through the buffet or Luby 's Cafeteria -- sneezes on the food , are you more or less likely to eat the food ? $ 2 million . Now , look , if you want to come to me and say that we should study Alzheimer 's disease , I have open ears -- and on heart disease , diabetes -- but if you want to study whether if somebody sneezes on the food makes you more or less likely to eat the food , that is just ridiculous . The American people know it is ridiculous . If the American people could see what we are voting on , they would say : Oh , we are going to combat China by giving more money to the most wasteful Agency in the world . Where is the money coming from ? Is it out of a surplus ? Can we go over to the Federal Reserve and open this big safe ? Is there a big case of money ? Is there a rainy day fund ? Is there a savings account that we can tap into to say we are going to have government-funded research to combat China ? No . We have to borrow the money from China . Think of the irony . We borrow the money from China to put it into technology . We complain about Chinese socialism , which is the government running everything and spending all of the money . So what are we going to do ? The same thing . We are going to borrow the money from China . Then we are going to have government-directed research , to which we will all say : Oh , socialism is n't good , but the government directed this . Yet we are going to do the same thing , and we are going to be stronger than China . This is a good example -- and this is sort of a technical detail -- of how the committee process works and how grant funding works . There was $ 700,000 allotted from the National Science Foundation for autism . Look , I know parents who have kids with autism , and I can be convinced that the Federal Government can be involved in some way , but the $ 700,000 that was allotted for autism was then taken and subcontracted to a bunch of eggheads who wanted to listen to a tape of Neil Armstrong on the Moon . If you are as old as I , you can remember being in school and seeing the crackly black-and-white pictures coming back from the Moon and hearing Neil Armstrong say : `` [ O ] ne small step for man , one giant leap for mankind '' -- or did he say : `` [ O ] ne small step for a man '' ? A group of `` researchers '' -- and I use the term loosely -- at the National Science Foundation got $ 700,000 of autism money to study one word , the preposition `` a . '' Did Neil Armstrong use the letter `` a '' or the word `` a '' or did he not ? So they studied , and they were diligent . They listened to this 20-second clip over and over again . I think it took them a year of listening to this . They wrote reports and had findings . Do you know what their conclusion was in the end ? It was , We just do n't know . We just do n't know . Was it `` [ O ] ne small step for man '' or `` [ O ] ne small step for a man '' ? This is something you could fix before throwing and heaping more borrowed money on the National Science Foundation . Maybe we could say that you ca n't subcontract money that was meant for Alzheimer 's to ridiculous research . [ [ Page S3917 ] ] How would you stop it ? Maybe you would have a committee that reviews the grants and that has someone on the committee from one of the big five diseases who actually says : Should we be spending the money on autism or should we spend the money on Neil Armstrong 's statement on the Moon ? Should we be spending it on this versus diabetes ? You see , everything is a tradeoff . Everybody comes to Washington . If you ask them -- you know , the people who advocate for Alzheimer 's or diabetes or cancer -- `` Are you getting enough money ? '' and when I tell the autism parents that their money went to study Neil Armstrong , do you know what I get ? I get dropped jaws and people going : You have got to be kidding me . My mother or father is dwindling away from Alzheimer 's , and they spent money studying Neil Armstrong ? Did he say : `` [ O ] ne small step for man '' or `` [ O ] ne small step for a man '' ? This is lizards on the treadmill . Dr. Coburn was a Senator here for a long time , and he liked to talk about waste as I do . This was a decade ago -- maybe more -- that Senator Coburn was on the floor and would be talking about lizards on a treadmill . I think his was lizards underwater on a treadmill or -- no . It was shrimp on a treadmill , I think . They have got lizards on treadmills , but they have got shrimp , and they have got crawfish on treadmills . Think about it , really . We are a big , proud country , but we are $ 1 trillion in debt . Before we get to all of the extra stuff -- before we get to all of the COVID bailouts -- we are $ 1 trillion in debt just from the institutional expenses of the country . We bring in about $ 3 trillion in revenue , and we spend about $ 4 trillion . Of the money that we bring in , $ 3 trillion is a lot . We could spend that on a lot of good things , but we ca n't simply just say we are going to spend it on lizards on a treadmill and that somehow we have enough money to do that . So of the expenses that we have , most of the money is consumed by Medicare , Medicaid , Social Security , food stamps , and the military , and then a variety of the welfare programs . But that consumes $ 1 trillion more than comes in . So we have been meeting over the last year , just spending extra money beyond the trillion-dollar deficit . So we have a trillion-dollar deficit just from our ordinary expenses , and then we add to that , you know , a couple trillion here for COVID last year , a couple trillion more . We are going to do a couple trillion more for free college , free daycare , free this , free that , but it is not free . There is no such thing as a free lunch . There is nothing in this world that you will get for free . You will either have the future paying for it -- our kids and our grandkids paying for it -- or you will pay for it through inflation or you will pay for it through default . And you can default in a dramatic way , through the destruction of a currency , or you can default in a gradual way through price inflation . As it is , we are starting to see the price inflation take off . There are people concerned about inflation that is already in the stock market and where this goes from here . But I do n't think this bill makes us stronger . In fact , I think the Chinese sit back and , you know , hold their hand up and sort of titter and laugh at America thinking they are going to be stronger by borrowing more money from China . So I just do n't think it makes us any stronger at all . I think it makes us weaker , and it would be one thing if it were n't being so horribly wasted . Lizards on a treadmill . So they get the lizard on a treadmill and then they have active x rays to look at its joints . They were curious as to why a lizard waddles . So if you have ever seen a lizard or an iguana when they walk funny , they waddle . So why do they waddle ? You know , what do their joints look like in x rays ? And so we spent , you know , $ 1.5 million studying lizards on a treadmill . One of the perennial problems in the Third World is the black market . We have it in our country . It is sort of a function of when taxes and regulation in the official economy become so onerous that you need to escape the official economy . That is what the black market is . So a good example is New York City . The taxes on cigarettes are so high in New York City that you have a black market . In fact , the death of Eric Garner -- the sad death of Eric Garner being choked to death in New York City had to do with taxes . And some people were offended by this . They go : It was police brutality . Of course , it was , but it was police brutality based on exorbitant taxes that caused this man to be selling cigarettes -- loose cigarettes in order to try to make a living . But that is what happens when government becomes so big . So in parts of Africa , Uganda in particular , there is a big black market . And so God knows why or why in the world we are spending our money studying this , we decided to study gambling in Uganda . So we spent $ 30,000 studying gambling in Uganda . Well , it turns out the black market develops because they do n't have good title to their land , they do n't have good rule of law , they do n't have the things that have made our country great . But instead of sort of exporting think tank ideas on how great capitalism is , we waste it through government grants studying why Ugandans gamble . It kind of is reminiscent going back to the Wuhan lab . People say -- this is what Dr. Fauci has been saying . Dr. Fauci says : Well , who would n't want to study the SARS virus ? Well , yeah , we should . But , then again , why would we pay the Chinese to do it ? Well , there are all these viruses in China . Well , are the Chinese destitute ? I think we are here because the Chinese are kicking our butt in trade , and everybody is worried about China so we are going to do all this stuff to combat China , and yet we send money to a Chinese lab . Now , we recently voted to change that , but it has been going on for decades . In fact , Dr. Fauci , in committee the other day , said he still trusts the Chinese , the Chinese scientists . He seems oblivious to the fact that perhaps there is a military influence in these labs and perhaps the scientists do n't do anything without permission of the Chinese military ; perhaps if there was a militarization of the virus going on -- oblivious to that . So there is a Space Camp in Alabama . My kids went to it one year . It is a great camp , and I am all for it . I , you know , would like to see more Americans go . If some American kids , you know , do n't have the means , it would be nice if we could help American kids go to Space Camp . But I am not so sure , you know , why we borrow money from China to send kids in Pakistan to Space Camp in Alabama or to Dollywood -- you know , $ 250,000 . We also spent over a million dollars in Afghanistan doing an anti- drug program . Unfortunately , really , the drug problems in our country -- they grow it . They grow it like corn . It is a crop for them . The problem is the demand comes from us , but we spent a million dollars on public relations television programming in Afghanistan , and it was to convince the Afghanis not to use drugs . It was in English . So the vast majority of them could n't understand or -- you know , most of them do n't have television sets anyway . But this is the kind of thing that runs rampant throughout our government . So , you know , we talk about where would we find the resources to be a strong country again , to do the things that we could do to combat what happens in China . When we look at that , we say where could the money come from ? Well , we spend $ 50 billion a year in Afghanistan on the war . It has been going on 20 years . The war is 18 years past having any useful mission at all . The mission was over probably once the Taliban was defeated . There was still some mission for bin Laden , but it did n't really require necessarily troops on the ground and nation-building . But we have been doing nation-building in Afghanistan . So our Nation crumbles , and we worry about China -- you know , the threat of the ascendance of China -- and yet , what are we doing ? We are borrowing money from China to build roads in Afghanistan . One of the things they did in Afghanistan years ago is they were going to build a natural gas gas station . This was to reduce the footprint of Afghanistan , the carbon footprint . So this is the absurdities we sometimes go to with climate change . This is a country that cooks their food on [ [ Page S3918 ] ] open fires often . This is a country with an average income of about $ 800 . Most people do not have a car . So what did we decide to do for Afghanistan to reduce their carbon footprint ? We decided to build a natural gas gas station So the natural gas gas station was built . It was supposed to cost $ 800,000 , but , you know , sometimes government is not that efficient so they had a few cost overruns -- 83 -- and it ended up costing $ 45 million . So my question , as I heard about this natural gas gas station , was , How many Americans have a car that runs on natural gas ? I think there are a handful of people who are really into it and have converted their cars into running on natural gas . There is a trucking company I am aware of . You know , it is not a bad idea , but it is a boneheaded , idiotic idea to build a gas station for natural gas vehicles in Afghanistan . They do n't have cars , much less cars that run on natural gas , but we did it . We spent $ 45 million in Afghanistan on it . So my staff was over there looking at the waste , and they said to the military : Can we go see the famous natural gas gas station ? And as they -- they wanted to go see it . The marine said : Well , it would take two helicopters full of 30 marines in each helicopter to take you to the gas station , so we were told it was too dangerous , and we did n't want to insist on something that was that dangerous . So we spent $ 45 million on a gas station that we ca n't visit because it is too dangerous to serve up natural gas that nobody has a car that runs on natural gas . And my imagination goes to the gas station , and all I can imagine is sort of copper tubing sticking out of the ground , people running off with copper tubing . We built major highways over there , but one of the biggest problems is no cars , but the other problem they have in Afghanistan is people put their camels in their tents , and so if you ever want a car to go up and down the road , you got to shoo the camels and the tents off the road . We decided to build luxury hotels . See , this is part of our national defense . I think it was the Overseas Investment Bank , or whatever . We spent $ 90 million on a hotel in Kabul . Well , we did n't quite get it finished . The contractor built about half the hotel . He built the shell of the hotel with no walls . I think he completed one room so he could send pictures home to say he was making progress . The hotel was never built . The guy ran off with , like , 60 million of the 90 million . The hotel still sits there , and guess what . It is a shell of a building . Our people are worried about the Taliban crawling up in it and shooting down into our Embassy . So the next thing is -- I am surprised it is not in this bill . It may be . Who knows what is in this bill . They need another 250 grand to destroy what is left of the hotel . The guy ran off with the money , and we have a shell of a building . It is a danger to our Embassy so we need to tear it down . So , really , you know , we should have an amendment to put more money in this bill to tear down the hotel -- the luxury hotel that we subsidized in Afghanistan . The list goes on and on and on . The frustration of the American people is , Why does it never change ? William Proxmire was talking about this in 1972 , studying why people fall in love . Why do people date ? The government is doing dating apps studying why people are happy or unhappy , studying whether or not , if you take a selfie of yourself smiling and look at it later in the day , whether or not that will make you happy . Seriously . Half a million here , a million there . Is there anything in this bill that will stop that from happening ? So it has been happening for 50 years . You know , we did n't even authorize these things . They just go on and on . There is no oversight . You ask any questions , nobody wants to give you any answers , and it goes on and on . Now , this is n't just one party . Both parties do it . Both parties are going to vote for this bill , but I guarantee , if you put up the different waste things that are going on in our government and you said that this is the Agency that is studying the mating call of the Panamanian frog , these are the Agencies studying whether someone sneezes on your food , you think the American people would be with you ? They are only with you because they do n't know what you are doing today . They do n't know that you are wasting more money ; that you are shoveling good money after bad . They do n't know that this is more of the same ; that this has been going on for 50 years . And nobody , Republican or Democrat , is fixing the problem . We are just shoveling more money out the door . We are destroying our country . We are destroying our currency . Right now , it is a little bit at a time . It is coming through inflation , but inflation is out there . It is lurking . People are talking about it . But there is also another way you can destroy your country . If you look at the 20th century and you look at the decline in the stock market , most of it is in , like , 7 days . So those who think that we could n't have a precipitous correction ; that there could n't be a precipitous correction , where all of a sudden everybody wakes up in the marketplace and says `` Oh , my goodness . The emperor has no clothes '' -- we are $ 28 trillion in debt , and we have companies that have , you know , 200-to-1 price-to-earnings ratio . We have companies that are worth hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars , and yet what is their profit ? Some of them do n't make a profit . Is there going to be a day where people wake up and say : `` Oh , my goodness , the stock market . The emperor has no clothes , '' and there is a massive selloff ? I do n't know . But I do worry that the stock market is grossly inflated . I do worry , when we pass out $ 1,400 checks , which we did not have , we give them to everybody , and what do the young people do with their checks ? Buy GameStop . So GameStop goes through the roof , makes no profit . It is a dying company , and it goes through the roof because everybody gets giddy on it because everybody has got all this free money . There is no free money . Ultimately , the $ 1,400 we gave to people will be lost as wages do n't keep up with inflation . It happens even as we speak . Inflation has been low , but over the last decade , the dollar lost 17 percent of its purchasing power . Do you think everybody in America got a 17-percent gain ? See , this is sort of the difference between the seen and the unseen . Frederic Bastiat was a philosopher , parliamentarian in France in the 19th century , and he talked a lot about this . He wrote a book called `` The Law , '' and he talked about the seen and the unseen . It is also the intended and the unintended . People -- I call it the big heart , small brain syndrome of Washington . Everybody wants to help somebody . We have the same compassion . We want to help those out of work , but if you give people too much not to work , then they wo n't work . If people do n't work for a long period of time , they wo n't be hired again . This was illustrated when we extended unemployment to 99 weeks . It was done out of compassion , but as we extended unemployment to 99 weeks , what happened ? Anybody who stayed out of work 99 weeks and came in looking for a job , if there was another worker that had been out of work less , guess who got hired . Every study showed this . So if an employer is faced with two employees , one has been out of work 10 weeks , one has been out of work 99 weeks , guess who gets hired . The one who has been out of work 10 weeks . So when you institutionalize unemployment , when you pay people more from the government not to work than to work , you get a permanent class of unemployed , and there comes a point when they are unemployable . What does that do to the people ? What does that do to a person ? I think our self-esteem is tied up in what we do for a living , and I think there is self-esteem in every job , from cleaning the floors , to designing a carpet , to creating the carpet , to laying bricks , to being a doctor or lawyer . Your self-esteem comes from being proud of your work . It comes from work . You can not get self-esteem without work , and you ca n't be given self-esteem . We have some newfangled ideas in school that we just give it . You know , Johnny ca n't spell , but we are going to pat him on the back and give him a [ [ Page S3919 ] ] trophy because it will help his self-esteem . No . You have to earn self- esteem . But if we get a whole class of people who do n't work , it is a problem -- the lack of self-esteem , the worry and concern that come from this . The lack of what it takes to be a robust person is part of the problem with the sinking into despair and addiction that we have as a problem in our country . This is another waste project that comes out of our State Department . We fund the State Department for diplomacy . I am for that . But we end up funding things in the State Department , and you wonder if they are useful for diplomacy or whether they are just pork barrel politics . This is $ 850,000 that was given to a for-profit Afghan television station to support the development of a national cricket league . Really ? So our State Department , which -- you know , we have to pay Ambassadors . We have to pay Assistant Ambassadors . We have got to pay all the different personnel , those protecting the Ambassadors and our Embassies . We have to pay for Embassies , the electricity . All that stuff , we have to do . I am for that . Where do we get the money to pay for cricket ? Why is this the business of the U.S. Government ? But here is the point : Does it ever get better ? Does someone say `` My goodness . Someone stuck this little earmark in for the National Cricket League '' ? Does someone ever say `` Oh my goodness . We did this ? '' and we reform the process and never do it again ? No . We give them more money . Every year , every Agency in government gets more money . If you think there is a waste problem in government and you want to fix it , it wo n't get better if you give people more money . You would have to give them less . So what I would do is I would give everybody 99 percent of what they had last year -- if it is a terrible Agency like the National Science Foundation , I might give them 50 percent of what they had last year -- and I would say to them : Prove to me that you are not going to do this again . They were studying dating back in 1972 , and Proxmire lampooned them . Fifty years later , they are studying selfies . They have n't learned their lesson . If you look at the process , they pick the people they want to approve their projects . You scratch my back ; I will scratch yours . You do cocaine studies ? Hey , me too . You approve my cocaine study ; I will approve yours . That is what goes on at the National Science Foundation . This one is kind of close to home . You may have seen it . We call it `` A Streetcar Named Waste . '' It is about a couple blocks from the Capitol over on H Street . It is a streetcar they spent millions of dollars on . For years , there was nobody on it , and for years , it did n't go anywhere . It was a streetcar to nowhere , basically . But we spent $ 1.6 million on this , and basically you could see it as basically a trolley car with nobody in it . It was sort of this nostalgia . It is one thing to preserve something , but it is another thing to create some sort of thing that has n't existed for 50 years and nobody rides . And that cost us $ 1.6 million , and often you will see it sitting vacant and not in use at all . Now , we have decided that -- I do n't even know why they even think they need this anymore because I think climate alarmism has really penetrated all of our education . But just in case there is a child in the country who is not afraid that the oceans will rise and cover the land and that we are all going to drown and that the polar bears are going to drown , we need to make sure they know it through a special video game . So we spent half a million dollars on a video app to try to convince our kids that the polar bears are drowning sometime soon and that the end of the world is around the corner . Will the Chair inform me how much time I have remaining ? The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore . Twenty-eight and a half minutes . Mr. PAUL . I think at this point , I would reserve the remainder of my time . Mr. President , I would reserve the remainder of my time . The PRESIDING OFFICER ( Mr. Padilla ) . The Senator from Alabama Mr. TUBERVILLE . Mr. President , today I would like to speak on some amendments I have for this bill . I think it is important that we are all heard on this bill , that everybody gets an opportunity to understand what we are doing here . I think the people back home in Alabama would really appreciate that . I am getting a lot of emails and letters about things that are going on with this bill , and I just want the people back home to understand what we are laying out there to where we can -- our people back in Alabama understand the direction that we are taking . You know , I spoke recently about how the President 's skinny budget is disappointing and dangerous and a disservice to our men and women in uniform . China actively seeks to outpace the U.S. military , and in some cases , they are succeeding . This is n't a 5- or 10-year problem ; the threat is right now . It is no secret that the Chinese Communist Party , or the CCP , wants to replace the United States as the world 's top power . The American people need to be aware of how the Chinese Communist Party is coming after us -- not just with missiles and military might but with plans to subdue the American spirit . A significant part of what has made the United States a global powerhouse is the strength and resilience of our private sector companies . Whether it is in the technology , healthcare , or energy sector , American innovation is unravelling . It is what made us the greatest economy in the history of the world . China 's leaders know this , but rather than go head-to-head in an honest competition , they have settled for stealing our intellectual property . Chinese businesses , at the instruction of their government , lure American companies in . They offer cheap -- very cheap -- labor . They promise an exchange of ideas , but they really want to steal our valuable intellectual property . China 's strategy is to rob , replicate , and replace . China robs American companies of their intellectual property . They replicate our technology . They will go after whatever they can to get their hands on wind turbines , airplane designs , underwater drones , chemicals , or artificial intelligence technology . According to the Department of Justice , between 2011 and 2018 , more than 90 percent of the Department 's foreign economic espionage cases involved China . Their goal is to surpass the U.S. economy and gain a monopoly control over every major industry . We can not allow them to succeed . Even more alarming is what China is doing from within our own universities . Confucius Institutes currently operate at 55 American colleges and universities . They actually serve as a beachhead for the Chinese Government within America 's research institutions . Often , just the presence of a Confucius Institute on campus will enable Chinese officials to stifle any criticism of the Chinese Government at that university . The institutes also allow the Chinese Government to harvest valuable data from research being conducted at our country 's world-class institutions . I was also glad to see Alabama A & M , a public land-grant , historically Black university , make the decision to close their Confucius Institute just last month . The United States and the entire Western world have given China valuable concessions for decades . We gave China a seat at the table thinking they would change , but they have played their hand ruthlessly . It is past time we recognize that despite all the good intentions , this strategy has failed and failed miserably . The Chinese Communist Party has continually spied on its citizens , violently suppressed dissent , and systematically persecuted religious and ethnic minorities to the point of genocide . I sincerely hope President Biden will continue to build on the Trump administration 's momentum in pushing back against China 's aggressive rise . The TSP , or the Thrift Savings Plan , is the 401 ( k ) -style investment plan that over 6 million Federal Government employees , both military and civilian , use for their retirement plan . The plan manages more than $ 700 billion in assets . Back in 2017 , the Board that governs the TSP decided to invest billions in companies with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party . Now , the people who put money in this are all of our [ [ Page S3920 ] ] military in this country , all our civilian government officials , including everybody in this room , in Congress , anybody who works for the Federal Government . This is their 401 ( k ) . Do we want to be investing in China ? We need congressional action to make President Trump 's decision with the Thrift Savings Plan permanent . I bet if you ask folks who work at these buildings or who served the United States overseas if they want their retirement savings going to Chinese companies , you would hear a loud no . I will be offering a solution on this to protect our national security and safeguard the retirements of those who have served our country with honor and distinction . The problem with the companies that are being invested in in China -- they do n't go by the same rules we go by . They commit corporate espionage . They do n't go by the same standards of unity or same standards in banking . They take money from the Federal Government and from our employees to support the military in China . "

      "On defense spending , our job as elected officials is to make sure those who have stepped up to defend our country have the resources they need to do their job . The President 's recent budget proposal for the Department of Defense does not -- I repeat , does not -- give our men and women in uniform the tools to do their job . It is clear that President Biden thinks we do n't need further investment in our military . If it is clear , he thinks it is OK to ask our men and women to do more with less , and that is impossible . The world has changed a lot in 50 years . When President Biden first came to Washington in 1972 , there were two superpowers , the United States of America and the Soviet Union . Back then , we spent 6.5 percent of our Federal budget on national defense -- 6.5 percent . Today , we spend less than 3.5 percent -- a huge drop . Secretary Austin has said that China remains the top `` pacing threat '' for our military . Simply keeping pace with China is not enough . We have got to outpace all of our adversaries , but doing that requires smart , substantial , and strategic investment in our military -- much more investment than the President and many people here in Congress publicly propose . President Biden says he wants his administration to trust the experts on things like COVID , but this defense budget shows he does n't apply that same principle to the Pentagon . Here is what ADM Charles Richard , Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command , who is over our nuclear capabilities , said in last week 's hearing to the Senate Armed Services Committee : I have what I need to deter today . . . . But I need it modernized . There 's no remaining margin of error . His warning is clear . We must modernize our greatest deterrent and keep peace among our adversaries with our nuclear arsenal . The free world , meaning the United States , works and sleeps under a nuclear umbrella that has n't been updated to the digital age . We are also in a new space race , and it is a race we have no choice that we must win . In the next 20 years , the total cost of just arming space will be $ 2 trillion , and we have no choice but to win in space . The Chinese want to weaponize this new frontier of war , and we are falling behind . We are also falling behind Russia . We have got to make a change in attitude toward what we are doing in space , and it starts right here in this room . I heard about the growing gap between us and the Chinese when I visited the Army Materiel Command at Redstone Arsenal a few weeks ago in Huntsville , AL . These folks shared with me how desperately we need to modernize our space-based systems that contribute to our missile defense . The U.S. Army is the largest consumer of space products , and our military relies on the Materiel Command to provide the resources to train our soldiers for research , development of new equipment , and defend our Nation . They should not have to beg us or the President of the United States for the money to invest in the capabilities that we need . At the end of the day , our generals ' main report to us is , `` We can afford to survive . '' Think about that quote : `` We can afford to survive . '' We also need to invest in the safety of our service men and women , especially in aviation . Currently , the average age of an airplane in our military is older than the pilots flying it . Alabama is home to Fort Rucker , to which every Army helicopter pilot comes to get their training . When I visited the folks at Fort Rucker , they told me about the very real need for increased flight training hours for pilots , which requires more investment and prioritization in the defense budget . Alabama stands ready to continue to build our military so we can maintain our status as a preeminent fighting force in the world . We have hundreds of contractors and more than 200,000 employed in the defense sector across our State in Alabama . Those top-notch men and women support our world-class military installations , from the shipbuilders in Mobile to Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville , and many places in between . Telling our forces to fight a war with outdated tools is like giving a football team some leather helmets and decades old , poorly fitted pads and expecting them to compete against modern equipment . But that is exactly what this administration 's defense budget is requesting our military to do . Frankly , it is a huge disappointment coming from our Commander in Chief . We can not let our men and women down . In the coming weeks , I will be working with colleagues on the National Defense Authorization Act and budget that will enable our military to do the job better today and prepare for all the challenges tomorrow . I am willing to keep fighting for the United States by investing in the men and women who keep us safe . I urge my colleagues and President Biden to do the same . "

      "Mr. President , years ago , I traveled to Israel with then-minority leader Senator Harry Reid . We met with Shimon Peres , and something happened that I have never forgotten . [ [ Page S2750 ] ] Senator Reid asked : `` What do you see as the greatest threat in the world to the United States ? '' That was just a couple of years after 9/ 11 when that question was posed . I thought Peres might cite terrorism or loose nukes . Instead , he said without hesitation : `` China . Do n't you see that ? '' Economically , strategically , diplomatically , China was already focused like a laser on advancing its position as the world 's most powerful nation , and that was 16 years ago . Five days ago , China launched a spacecraft safely and landed it on Mars , becoming only the second nation in history , after the United States , to land on the Red Planet . In 1957 , at the height of the Cold War , the Soviet Union became the first nation to launch an Earth-orbiting satellite into space . That launch shocked the world and caught us off guard . Our response was an unprecedented commitment to reclaim America 's dominance in the world as a leader in scientific and technological discovery and innovation . The effort became known as America 's Sputnik moment . Twelve years later , America put a man on the Moon . You might say that now , instead of a Sputnik moment , America is going through a Zhurong moment . That is the name of the Chinese Mars rover , Zhurong . Let me be clear . While China is our fastest growing competitor , the United States has lost some ground globally as many nations recognize the importance of R & D investments to their industrial innovation and competitiveness . In 1960 , just 3 years after Sputnik launched , the United States accounted for approximately 69 percent of the world 's R & D funding . By 2018 , 58 years later , this percentage had dropped from 69 percent to 28 percent . Others were joining in the pursuit of technology and innovation at a record clip . The question is , Can we come together , as Americans did in the last century , to make investments in science , technology , and competitiveness to guarantee that America 's economy remains the world 's largest and most innovative ? Some Members of Congress and the Senate -- and we have heard their speeches on the floor -- say : Go slow . No hurry . Well , I think they are committed to a solid second-place finish for the United States of America , and I do n't want to be a part of it . The Endless Frontier Act , which we are going to consider , gives us a reason for hope . It is broad-based . It is bipartisan . It shows leadership by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer ; Senator Todd Young , Republican of Indiana ; along with Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell of Washington and Ranking Member Roger Wicker of Mississippi . Like America 's response to Sputnik , the new era of scientific and technological discovery will be driven by seed money from the Federal Government , but this effort is not limited to government spending . America is home to the world 's best research colleges and universities and laboratories , like the Argonne National Lab in my State of Illinois . They are part of this effort too . We will harness the combined efforts of America 's best scientific and technological minds in the public sector and the private sector . The Endless Frontier Act and broader competitiveness package represent the largest investment in U.S. science and technology since the Apollo era . It will authorize more than $ 100 billion over 5 years to support breakthrough scientific discovery and technological innovation in 10 key areas vital to building an innovation economy for the 21st century and creating good jobs in the process . These key areas include fields such as advanced energy , semiconductors , artificial intelligence , biotechnology and genomics , quantum computing , robotics , materials science , disaster prevention , and , of course , cyber security . If you need a reminder of why it is urgent that we improve U.S. cyber security , look at how the ransomware attack last week by Russian cyber criminals on a major American oil pipeline caused long gas lines and panic buying throughout the eastern half of our country . Investing strategically in these 10 key innovation areas will enable the United States to protect America 's position as a leader in the global economy and protect our national security . It will reinvigorate and expand our industrial and manufacturing base , and it will create a stronger middle class in our country . The Endless Frontier Act will also strengthen the security of essential supply chains and our ability to solve disruptions caused by crises . Remember those fearless doctors and nurses working in COVID-19 wards last year , when they had to dress in garbage bags because of a nationwide shortage of PPE ? A nation as wealthy and powerful as ours should never be caught so dangerously unprepared . This bill will make sure that we are n't . Here is another cautionary tale about supply-line disruption . In Belvidere , IL , which is in the northern part of our State , workers at the Stellantis plant are proud of their work assembling Jeep Cherokees . In late March , that plant was forced to shut down because of a global shortage of microchips . The plant is scheduled to reopen as soon as the end of this month . But late last week , the company announced that the plant will be forced to shut down one of its two production lines in late July , again because of microchip shortages . As many as 1,600 employees could be laid off . You ca n't build a prosperous economy and stable middle class if you ca n't secure your supply lines . We know that American workers can build cars and trucks for the future because they are already doing it , and they are going to be launching it in many places around our Nation . Just this week , President Biden visited an electric vehicle assembly plant in Michigan . And they are doing it today as well in Normal , IL , where a company called Rivian -- remember the name : R-I-V-I-A-N , Rivian -- repurposed and expanded a former Mitsubishi assembly plant to produce the company 's first assembly plant for electric cars and trucks . Is this going to work ? Will it actually have a demand for electric vehicles ? Remember this one too . Amazon has already ordered 100,000 delivery vans from this plant . By the end of the year , Rivian expects to employ 2,500 people at the Normal assembly plant , 2,500 workers in good- paying , middle-class jobs in America . The Endless Frontier Act and President Biden 's American Jobs Plan provides the leadership and resources to make sure that America remains the world leader in the 21st century . On another critical issue , let me say that we need to get serious when it comes to combating intellectual property theft and counterfeiting . The previous administration 's policies were haphazard . We can do better . The Endless Frontier Act will impose tough sanctions on entities that violate U.S. intellectual property and trade protections . I am working with Senator Cassidy , a Republican from Louisiana , and others on a bipartisan bill that provides additional safeguards to combat the sale of counterfeit goods , especially on the internet . As I said , the Endless Frontier Act and competitiveness package will invest more than $ 100 billion over 5 years to support breakthrough technologies . Now , $ 100 billion is a big investment , but it is dramatically less than what China is now spending in the same areas . And it is far less when adjusted for inflation than what we spent on the race for space . If we contributed the same share of our GDP to science and technology today as we did in the early 1960s -- 1 percent of our overall economy -- we would have to spend $ 900 billion , not $ 100 billion , in this effort . My support for the Endless Frontier Act builds on my commitment to securing steady , predictable funding increases for so many research Agencies of the Federal Government but especially for NIH . They provided the lifesaving vaccines that allow us to take off our masks and resume our lives . Monday , I went out to NIH with several of my colleagues . Senator Blunt led a group from the Appropriations Committee . We met with NIH Director Francis Collins , Dr. Anthony Fauci , and scientists who are working on breakthrough discoveries . It was 6 years ago that Senator Roy Blunt , Republican from Missouri , and I made an informal pact . We worked together to increase the NIH budget by 5 percent a year over and above inflation . With the help of Senator Patty [ [ Page S2751 ] ] Murray and Lamar Alexander , we increased the NIH budget more than 40 percent . Because of those modest investments and the genius of NIH-funded researchers , we have a real chance of developing better treatments and cures for terrible diseases , including cancers , sickle cell , and Alzheimer 's . The race for the future is n't an either-or deal -- either we invest in science or breakthrough technologies . We have to invest in both . I will continue to work with Senators from both parties to preserve steady , predictable funding increases for research . No one bill will safeguard our national security or resolve all of our outstanding issues with China . We still have a lot of work to do , both in Congress and diplomatically . We still have to strengthen our immigration system so that America continues to welcome immigrants who want to put their genius to work for the good of America , as Nikola Tesla and Albert Einstein did in the last century , as did Katalin Kariko , the Hungarian-born Nobel laureate whose NIH-funded research paved the way for today 's COVID vaccines . Strengthening America 's role as a global leader in science and technology is an essential piece of our effort to preserving our leadership in the world . For that reason , I support the Endless Frontier Act , and I urge my colleagues to do the same . The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore . The Senator from Wyoming . "
