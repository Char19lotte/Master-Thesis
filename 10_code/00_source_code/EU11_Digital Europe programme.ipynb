      "Valter Flego , Reporter . - Honorable President , Commissioner , the European Parliament will give the green light to the Digital Europe program today . As a citizen of the European Union and as a program rapporteur , I am very happy about that . First of all , I would like to thank all of you from the bottom of my heart for your great help and support . We succeeded on time and without delay . Digital Europe today is getting its formal end , that is , its big operational start , which we honestly hardly all expect together . From virtual meetings and remote voting , paperless offices through supercomputers and artificial intelligence to smart homes and driverless cars . The digital revolution is happening fast and irreversibly . At the same time , the negative economic consequences of covida-19 will be severe and severe , and it is here that the digital industry plays a key role as a major tool for increasing European competitiveness and resilience . As a powerful tool for a better standard of living and a more comfortable life and daily work , as a driver of significant new sources of income based on the latest business models and services . It is digital as well as green . The main goal of this mandate . The main goal of this decade in our modern Europe , and the widespread application of digital technologies and solutions , is key to overcoming the investment gap that affects both the private and the public . In 2021 , when we nostalgically remember the distant 2019 , the importance of digital is unquestionable even for the biggest skeptics . Yes , we ’ ve all , whether we like it or not , digitized over the past year . Our work , business , private and business communication , socializing and free time . In the past year , everything has been digitized at an enviable speed , but in order to achieve a turning point in economies , this digitalization must be supported by a true digital transformation . This means a deeper change that deals with internal processes , human skills and our culture , because the rear of Europe is reserved for those who underestimate the importance of digital transformation . That is why digital Europe wants to contribute to strengthening a Europe in which digital technologies also enable better health and all public services in general . Better education , more successful fight against climate change , digital transformation of public and private companies , transport , tourism , industry , medicine , the whole economy and the whole industry . Equally important , with Digital Europe we want to strengthen the trust our citizens have in digital technologies by absolutely protecting their privacy , security and consumer rights , while increasing the transparency and speed of services provided . With Digital Europe , we want to contribute to achieving European digital independence and strengthening competitiveness in the global digital economy , but at the same time we are responsibly approaching new generations , new processes and new jobs . The Digital Europe program will play a significant and powerful role in the coming years , but I want to remain absolutely realistic in my predictions . 7.5 billion euros is a lot of money . With this money , for example , one Croatia can significantly accelerate its transition to e-society . However , Digital Europe is only one and in itself limited aid , one program , and it is not a program to build digital capacity with the most European money . Therefore , it is important that there is cooperation and synergy between European programs , that there is coordination , that it is known who is working and in what way . Complementarity with other programs is important , for example with the Horizon Europe program , which with its almost 100 billion euros covers a much wider area , as well as with the multiannual financial framework 2021-2027 . Digital and green , ladies and gentlemen , are therefore two indispensable items of every next European program and project , and the key priorities of the programming period ahead .

The `` Digital Europe '' program is the first program of the European Union that comprehensively covers issues related to digitization and treats digitization as a horizontal phenomenon .
