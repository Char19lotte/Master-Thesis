  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.


                           Automated Vehicles

  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, from the beginning, the story of the U.S. 
auto industry has been one of ingenuity, of taking risks, and of 
pushing forward.
  At the dawn of the 20th century, most Americans could hardly 
comprehend the idea of the automobile. Yet, 20 years later, they had 
become nearly ubiquitous in American life, thanks to the insistence of 
entrepreneurs like Henry Ford on making the automobile affordable for 
the majority of Americans.
  The democratization of the automobile, rather than the invention of 
the automobile itself, is, in my opinion, one of most remarkable and 
uniquely American success stories.
  Automobiles allowed Americans to capitalize on the economic dynamism 
of the roaring twenties and helped Americans move and adapt during the 
Great Depression.
  They contributed greatly to the American industrial base and the 
know-how needed to fight and win the Second World War and help propel 
the United States to its current status as a preeminent global economic 
and military power.
  Visionary investments like the Interstate Highway System made cars a 
staple in American economic and cultural life. And cars certainly made 
it a lot easier to get to and from rural America. In a place like rural 
South Dakota, with limited public transportation, the automobile, often 
a pickup or an SUV, is typically the only way to get around.
  Today, the automobile industry stands on the brink of a new 
technological revolution, which promises to dramatically transform 
mobility once again.
  Over the past three decades, the internet has transformed our economy 
and our way of life, and the next generation of the internet, 5G, which 
is currently being deployed across the Nation, will enable a host of 
new innovations, including a revolution in vehicle technology: 
automated vehicles or what we call AVs.
  AVs will change the way that we move in numerous ways, making the 
transportation system safer, more efficient, and more accessible.
  Individuals whose mobility is currently limited, for example, 
Americans with disabilities, could gain new independence with the 
deployment of automated vehicles, allowing them to work or visit 
friends and family safely and easily.
  I am proud that my proposed AV amendment to the Endless Frontier Act 
was recently endorsed by the National Federation of the Blind, and I 
ask for unanimous consent that the letter of endorsement be inserted in 
the Record
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

                             National Federation of the Blind,

                                                     May 11, 2021.
     Hon. Maria Cantwell,
     Chair, U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, & 
         Transportation, Washington, DC.
     Hon. Roger Wicker,
     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, & 
         Transportation, Washington, DC.
       Dear Chair Cantwell and Ranking Member Wicker: The National 
     Federation of the Blind, the nation&#x27;s transformative civil 
     rights organization of the blind, supports and endorses the 
     amendment to the Endless Frontier Act filed with the 
     committee by Senator Thune on May 10, 2021. Specifically, we 
     support the portions of the amendment that will create an 
     exemption classification for manufacturers who provide 
     transportation access for people with disabilities and 
     prohibit discriminatory licensing practices for highly 
     automated vehicles.
       Subsection (d)(2)(C) of the amendment would create an 
     exemption category under the federal motor vehicle safety 
     standards located in Section 30113 of title 49 United States 
     Code that would ``provide transportation access for 
     individuals with disabilities, including non-visual access 
     for individuals who are blind or visually impaired.&#x27;&#x27; This 
     addition to the law will provide the incentive needed for 
     automobile manufacturers to ensure that the unique 
     requirements for Americans with disabilities to be able to 
     operate automated vehicles are considered in the early stages 
     of development.
       Subsection (e)(3) of the amendment would mandate that a 
     state ``may not issue a motor vehicle operator&#x27;s license for 
     the operation or use of a highly automated vehicle in a 
     manner that discriminates on the basis of disability.&#x27;&#x27; This 
     will ensure that current requirements necessary to obtain a 
     driver&#x27;s license, like a vision test, will not be required in 
     order to operate or use a highly automated vehicle. We are 
     pleased to see this subsection included in the amendment 
     because highly automated vehicles will pilot themselves (SAE 
     Level 4 and Level 5), making a vision requirement arbitrary 
     and discriminatory.
       Highly automated vehicles have the potential to 
     revolutionize the transportation landscape, especially for 
     individuals with disabilities. However, those same 
     individuals with disabilities who stand to gain the most from 
     the creation and proliferation of highly automated vehicles 
     could be left out of this new frontier if specific actions 
     are not taken. Senator Thune&#x27;s amendment to the Endless 
     Frontier Act is an important step to ensure that America&#x27;s 
     journey toward automotive automation is fully inclusive of 
     those who will benefit most.
           Sincerely,

                                            Mark A. Riccobono,

                                                        President.

  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, imagine a farmer in rural South Dakota 
who can no longer drive to get to town for appointments, prescriptions, 
or groceries--enter the automated vehicle.
  This technology has potential to keep people in their homes and 
communities longer.
  Moreover, AVs have potential to greatly increase roadway safety. 
Currently, there are an average of more than 35,000 traffic fatalities 
on our Nation&#x27;s roadways each year, including pedestrian, motorcycle, 
and bicycle fatalities. Automated vehicles could dramatically--
dramatically--reduce that number. Distracted driving, driving while 
impaired--automated vehicles could eliminate those dangers.

  For automated vehicle technology to advance, it is imperative that 
the regulatory framework catch up with private-sector innovation. That 
is why I have pushed for the enactment of AV legislation over the years 
and why I had hoped--I had hoped--that we would be voting to add my 
automated vehicles amendment to the legislation before the Senate 
today.
  I have spent nearly 5 years--5 years--working in a bipartisan manner 
on a legislative framework to govern the testing and deployment of 
automated vehicles. The amendment I offered to the bill before us today 
is an amendment that I had hoped to be able to offer with bipartisan 
support. It would have paved the way for expanded testing and 
deployment of automated vehicles in the United States under the 
oversight of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
  And let me emphasize that oversight point. My amendment would ensure 
that automated vehicles would not--not--touch pavement without the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#x27;s certification that 
they are at least as safe as a conventional vehicle. The data gathered 
from the vehicles deployed as a result of this amendment would be 
crucial to the development of future motor vehicle safety standards for 
AVs.
  Unfortunately, bipartisan agreement on my amendment collapsed when 
special interests expressed their opposition, despite major efforts to 
accommodate their concerns. And I am deeply disappointed that, once 
again, Democrats yielded to pressure from special interests against the 
best interests of our economy and the American people.
  Advancing AV technology is not just a vehicle safety issue. It is 
also an issue of U.S. leadership and global competitiveness. Investing 
in the production of AV technology here in the United States would not 
only strengthen the resilience of the auto industry but also the 
Nation&#x27;s industrial base and our national security.
  The auto industry touches nearly every American State. For example, 
Horton in Britton, SD, manufactures engine cooling systems, providing 
steady, good paying jobs for that community and strengthening the local 
economy. The same story repeats itself countless times in communities 
all across the Nation.
  Providing millions of jobs and investing billions annually, the 
American auto industry is a critical component of the nation&#x27;s economy. 
Right now,

[[Page S3551]]

U.S. companies lead the world in AV technology, but other nations, like 
China, are seizing upon regulatory inaction and striving to take the 
lead. If we don&#x27;t move forward with automated vehicle technology, we 
will soon see some other nation leading the AV revolution.
  The legislative package before us today is designed to bolster the 
global competitiveness of the United States.
  It is pretty difficult to understand why this reasonable and, I might 
add, no cost AV amendment that would lead to untold benefits for our 
Nation&#x27;s transportation system, does not fit in. How can a bill making 
strong investments in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and 
advanced manufacturing exclude a legislative framework for AVs?
  Are we really going to back down from leading the world in automated 
innovation and technology and cede the future of this industry to 
nations like China? Will we really ignore the enormous--enormous--
safety benefits of these vehicles just to suit Democrats&#x27; political 
convenience?
  More than a century ago, when the automobile was invented, there were 
plenty of skeptics, but America&#x27;s automobile pioneers did not let that 
stop them. They seized the moment and pressed forward and ushered in a 
transportation revolution. We can do that again today or we can cede 
this moment to nations like China and let the American automobile 
industry fall permanently behind. That is the choice in front of us. I 
hope we will choose to seize this moment and pass the legislation we 
need to usher in another American transportation revolution.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.

     percent of its rare earth compounds from the People&#x27;s 
     Republic of China.
       (C) On March 26, 2014, the World Trade Organization ruled 
     that the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s export restraints on

     global rare earth mining market is a threat to the economic

     in the United States;
       (B) the United States should reduce reliance on the 
     People&#x27;s Republic of China for rare earth minerals through--
       (i) strategic investments in development projects, 
     production technologies, and refining facilities in the 
     United States; or
       (ii) in partnership with strategic allies of the United 
     States that are reliable trading partners, including members 
     of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue; and
       (C) the United States Trade Representative should initiate 
     multilateral talks among the countries of the Quadrilateral 
     Security Dialogue to promote shared investment and 
     development of rare earth minerals.
       (b) Report Required.--
       (1) In general.--Not later than 120 days after the date of

     the partnership of the countries of the Quadrilateral 
     Security Dialogue

     305 the following:

     ``SEC. 305A. PROCESS FOR EXCLUSION OF ARTICLES FROM DUTIES.

       ``(a) Analysis of Alternative Action.--Subject to 
     subsection (d), before taking action under section 301(b), 
     the Trade Representative shall analyze the impact of the 
     action on United States entities, particularly small 
     entities, and consumers in the United States with a goal of 
     mitigating the impact of duties on United States entities and 
     consumers in the United States, including by evaluating 
     alternatives or modifications to particular actions.
       ``(b) Process for Exclusion From Duties.--
       ``(1) In general.--Subject to subsection (d), the Trade 
     Representative shall establish and maintain a process for 
     exclusion requests from duties under section 301(b) unless 
     the Trade Representative determines and certifies to the 
     appropriate congressional committees that maintaining an 
     exclusion process--
       ``(A) would impair the ability of the United States to 
     maintain effective pressure to remove unreasonable or 
     discriminatory practices burdening commerce in the United 
     States; or
       ``(B) is impractical due to the low value of the duties 
     imposed.
       ``(2) Briefing.--If the Trade Representative makes a 
     certification under paragraph (1), not later than 3 days 
     before making the certification, the Trade Representative

     makes a certification under paragraph (1) with respect to 
     duties under section 301(b), not less frequently than once 
     every 180 days while those duties are in effect, the Trade 
     Representative shall determine and certify to the appropriate 
     congressional committees that the reasons for forgoing an 
     exclusion process with respect to those duties continue to be 
     present.
       ``(c) Implementation of Exclusion Process.--
       ``(1) In general.--In implementing an exclusion process 
     required under subsection (b)(1), the Trade Representative 
     shall consider whether and which criteria described in

     Representative considers appropriate under the circumstances, 
     are appropriate to apply in the exclusion process.

     paragraph for exclusion of articles from duties under section 
     301(b) include the following:
       ``(A) Whether the failure to grant the exclusion would 
     result in severe economic harm to the requester.
       ``(B) Whether the article or a reasonable substitute is not 
     commercially available to the requester.
       ``(C) Whether the imposition of the duty with respect to 
     the article would unreasonably increase consumer prices for 
     day-to-day items consumed by low- or middle-income families 
     in the United States.
       ``(D) Whether the imposition of the duty would have an 
     unreasonable impact on manufacturing output of the United 
     States.
       ``(E) Whether the imposition of the duty would have an 
     unreasonable impact on the ability of an entity to fulfill 
     contracts or to build critical infrastructure.
       ``(F) Whether the failure to grant the exclusion is likely 
     to result in a particular entity or entities having the 
     ability to abuse a dominant market position.
       ``(d) Exclusion of Certain Duties.--This section shall not 
     apply to duties imposed under section 301(b) pursuant to a 
     dispute resolution process under the World Trade 
     Organization.
       ``(e) Publication of Notice.--Subject to subsection (d), 
     not later than 90 days after imposing any duty under section 
     301(b), the Trade Representative, in consultation with such 
     other Federal agencies as the Trade Representative considers 
     appropriate, shall publish a notice in the Federal Register 
     regarding the criteria that the Trade Representative will 
     apply and the evidence it will evaluate in determining 
     whether a request for exclusion from such duty satisfies the 
     requirements of the exclusion process under subsection 
     (b)(1).
       ``(f) Definitions.--In this section:
       ``(1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term 
     `appropriate congressional committees&#x27; means--

     harm&#x27;, with respect to an exclusion from duties requested by 
     a United States entity, includes circumstances under which 
     failure to grant the exclusion would--
       ``(A) render the business of the entity unprofitable; or
       ``(B) result in a significant number or proportion of the 
     workers employed by the entity becoming totally separated 
     from employment.

       (b) Establishment of Exclusion Process for Certain Duties 
     Relating to People&#x27;s Republic of China.--

[[Page S3568]]

       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
     law, the United States Trade Representative shall establish a 
     process pursuant to which United States entities and 
     associations of those entities may request the exclusion of 
     articles from duties described in paragraph (2).
       (2) Duties described.--The duties described in this 
     paragraph are duties imposed pursuant to the investigation 
     initiated under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 
     U.S.C. 2411) on August 18, 2017, and with respect to which 
     notice was published in the Federal Register on August 24, 
     2017 (82 Fed. Reg. 40213).
       (3) Implementation of exclusion process.--In implementing 
     the process established under paragraph (1) for exclusion of 
     articles from duties described in paragraph (2), if the 
     exclusion of the article can likely be administered by U.S. 
     Customs and Border Protection--
       (A) the Trade Representative shall exclude that article 
     from the imposition of such a duty if the Trade 
     Representative determines, following a request from a United 
     States entity or an association of those entities, that the 
     failure to grant the exclusion would result in severe 
     economic harm to the requester;
       (B) unless the Trade Representative determines that 
     granting the exclusion would impair the ability of the United 
     States to maintain effective pressure to remove an 
     unreasonable or discriminatory practice burdening United 
     States commerce, the Trade Representative shall exclude that 
     article from the imposition of such a duty if the Trade 
     Representative determines following a request from a United 
     States entity or an association of those entities that--
       (i) the article or a reasonable substitute is not 
     commercially available to the requester;
       (ii) the imposition of the duty with respect to the article 
     would unreasonably increase consumer prices for day-to-day 
     items consumed by low- or middle-income families in the 
     United States;
       (iii) the imposition of the duty would have an unreasonable 
     impact on manufacturing output of the United States;
       (iv) the imposition of the duty would have an unreasonable 
     impact on the ability of an entity to fulfill contracts or to 
     build critical infrastructure; or
       (v) the failure to grant the exclusion is likely to result 
     in a particular entity or entities having the ability to 
     abuse a dominant market position; and
       (C) the Trade Representative may identify other criteria 
     relevant to determining whether the article shall be excluded 
     from the imposition of such a duty.
       (4) Timeframe of exclusion and renewal.--
       (A) Period of exclusion.--An exclusion of an article 
     requested under paragraph (1) from duties described in 
     paragraph (2)--
       (i) shall be for a period of 18 months; and
       (ii) shall be decided--

       (I) not later than 90 days before the duty is due to be

     SEC. 73006. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON LEADERSHIP AT WORLD TRADE 
                   ORGANIZATION.

       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
       (1) The United States had led the formation, as well as 
     reform, of rules governing the multilateral trading system 
     since World War II.
       (2) The United States is a founding member of the World 
     Trade Organization (in this section referred to as the 
     ``WTO&#x27;&#x27;) and a key architect of the organization.
       (3) The United States secured important commitments in the 
     WTO to facilitate trade in goods and services, to prevent the 
     application of non-scientific restrictions on United States 
     agriculture, and to protect United States intellectual 
     property.
       (4) The United States uses the rules of the WTO to benefit 
     workers, farmers, fishers, and businesses in the United 
     States by facilitating access to the 90 percent of the 
     world&#x27;s consumers who live outside the borders of the United 
     States.
       (5) The fundamental purpose of the WTO is to create space 
     for members to negotiate with each other, and the WTO 
     reserves to those members exclusively the right to negotiate 
     and adopt rules that reduce and eliminate trade barriers and 
     discriminatory treatment.
       (6) The prompt settlement of disputes in which a member of 
     the WTO considers that its rights are being impaired by the 
     actions of another member is essential to the functioning of 
     the WTO and the maintenance of

[[Page S3570]]

     a proper balance between the rights and obligations of 
     members.
       (7) The WTO&#x27;s dispute settlement function, including in 
     particular the Appellate Body, has increasingly failed to 
     enforce the rules of the WTO in a timely manner, and has 
     usurped the negotiating prerogative of members by creating 
     new obligations and rights that are inconsistent with or not 
     included in the rules negotiated by members.
       (8) The creation of those obligations and rights 
     undermines--
       (A) the WTO&#x27;s negotiating function by discouraging members 
     from making concessions; and
       (B) the WTO&#x27;s dispute settlement function by encouraging 
     overuse of the process and undermining its legitimacy, 
     including by preventing free market economies from responding 
     to globally trade distortive practices by nonmarket 
     economies.
       (9) The WTO does not have sufficient rules to discipline 
     the distortive economic policies of nonmarket economies, such 
     as policies relating to excess capacity and forced technology 
     transfer, the special treatment those economies afford to 
     state-owned enterprises, and their massive and opaque 
     industrial subsidies.
       (10) There is long-standing bipartisan support in Congress 
     to reform the WTO to address those failings.
       (11) The current presidential administration, as well as 
     prior administrations, raised concerns about the failings 
     described in this subsection and have made reform of the WTO 
     a top priority of United States trade policy.
       (12) The United States urges WTO members to work 
     constructively with the United States to assess the reasons 
     why the existing WTO rules have proven inadequate in order to 
     create an atmosphere within the WTO that is conducive to the 
     development of new rules less subject to jurisprudential 
     drift.
       (13) The guiding principle for reform of the WTO, and the 
     lens through which WTO members should consider specific 
     reform proposals, is the restoration of the WTO&#x27;s capability 
     and capacity for negotiation among members.
       (14) The United States has achieved its trade policy 
     objectives through active leadership at the WTO, and an 
     absence of that leadership would be filled by nonmarket 
     economies that are hostile to a host of United States 
     interests.
       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) while the United States finds value and usefulness in 
     the WTO, in order to fulfill the needs of the United States 
     and other free and open economies in the 21st century, 
     significant reforms are needed;
       (2) the United States must therefore continue to 
     demonstrate leadership to achieve reforms that restore the 
     effectiveness of the WTO&#x27;s--
       (A) negotiating function;
       (B) dispute settlement function so that it transparently, 
     efficiently, and fully enforces outcomes negotiated by 
     members rather than usurping their primacy by creating new 
     rights or obligations; and
       (C) rules for special and differential treatment to ensure 
     those rules promote advancement for truly developing 
     countries, rather than becoming tools for globally 
     competitive countries, like the People&#x27;s Republic of China, 
     to engage in protectionism and market distortions;
       (3) the efforts to reform the negotiating function of the 
     WTO should revitalize the negotiating function by providing 
     confidence to members that the WTO operates according to the 
     rules as negotiated and adopted by members;
       (4) a revitalized negotiating function must include new 
     rules that reflect the 21st century economy, further combat 
     anticompetitive and protectionist barriers, and ensure 
     disputes are efficiently resolved;
       (5) the United States Trade Representative should continue 
     to lead efforts to work with WTO members to pursue reforms at 
     the WTO that--
       (A) ensure the dispute settlement mechanism faithfully 
     applies the rules adopted by members, including by 
     undertaking measures to ensure the WTO&#x27;s Appellate Body does 
     not create new rights and obligations;
       (B) improve public confidence in dispute settlement by 
     promoting greater transparency and efficiency in the conduct 
     of proceedings;
       (C) redress the consistent failure by certain members to 
     satisfy their notification obligations under various WTO

     Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on currency manipulation, to

     of free market economies.

  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President and Members of the Senate, what we are 
going to be voting on shortly here, Senate Amendment No. 1562, is an 
example of the bipartisanship that can be achieved if we put in the 
hard work to work out the details and the differences between us on 
very critical issues.
  This is not just an amendment on one topic; this is an entire title, 
the Finance Committee&#x27;s title. The chairman of the Finance Committee, 
Senator Wyden, and I have worked for months

[[Page S3837]]

together to identify that intersection--which is a big one, as you will 
see--between Republicans and Democrats here in the Senate on trade 
policy to help us to put together a package of strong trade policy that 
will help us to stand up our efforts in pushing back against China in 
one of the most critical arenas that we face: trade, our economy, and 
working against the very nefarious activities that China is engaged in 
to try to undercut us economically and to undercut our American 
companies in our trade relationships.
  Senator Wyden and I worked hard together to get this done, and I am 
glad that we now have a package that can be put forward. As I said, it 
is not just one provision; this is an entire trade title. Let me 
summarize just some of the things that are in it.
  It provides a comprehensive approach to combat China&#x27;s manufacturing 
imbalances, threats to free and fair trade, and illicit activity, which 
undermine America&#x27;s leadership in innovation. This legislation will 
level the playing field for American consumers and companies, including 
workers, farmers, fishers, families, and taking aim at China&#x27;s worst 
practices.
  The amendment itself carries a bipartisan approach into a Senate-wide 
effort to ensure that the United States is positioned effectively to 
compete on a fair playing field globally--not just with China, 
globally, but especially with China.
  It bolsters efforts to prohibit goods made with forced labor from 
reaching the United States by strengthening our Customs and Border 
Protection enforcement efforts and through better use of the Seafood 
Import Monitoring Program.
  It provides modernized trade enforcement tools to U.S. Trade 
Representatives to address anti-competitive digital trade and 
censorship practices, like China&#x27;s great firewall, by requiring the 
USTR to identify trading partners that disrupt digital trade.
  It appoints a USTR official to oversee information communication 
technology and provides advance notice and text of proposals for any 
digital trade agreements 5 days before they are tabled to facilitate 
our efforts here in Congress to oversee an effective trade policy.
  It requires a review of trade in essential supplies, including the 
sources of imports, and analysis of any vulnerabilities, as well as 
additional tools for businesses in the United States seeking reliable 
suppliers.
  It strengthens oversight over U.S. trade policy by providing an 
inspector general to the USTR and by ensuring the application of 
section 301 tariffs related to China are calibrated to provide the 
necessary leverage to support American competition while ensuring U.S. 
competitiveness in manufacturing.
  It reauthorizes, critically, the miscellaneous tariff bill--what has 
been called the MTB--and improved generalized system of preferences, 
the GSP. That will promote human rights, the environment, women&#x27;s 
economic empowerment, and the rule of law and digital trade, and 
restarts and reforms the critical section 301 product exclusion 
process. These things might sound complicated, but it is our way of 
standing up our American competitors in a very anti-competitive 
environment dealing with China.
  It expands the duties of the Interagency Center on Trade 
Implementation, Monitoring, and Enforcement to include investigations 
of practices, diffuse impacts on the economy and workers of the United 
States where there is systemic impacts on the resiliency of multiple 
critical domestic supply chains. Standing up and building out our 
supply chains is critical in this economic competition.
  It requires the U.S. Trade Representatives to initiate talks with the 
Quad countries to develop a strategy on critical minerals to counter 
China&#x27;s dominant share of that global supply.
  It requires the CBP to submit a report to Congress on achieving 
supply chain transparency. CBP is seeking greater supply chain 
transparency to address merchandise made with forced labor, with 
counterfeits, and through a 21st Century Customs Framework Initiative.
  It requires the USTR to brief Congress on the findings of a 
forthcoming report by the Comptroller General of the United States 
related to that critical 301 exclusion process.
  It directs the USTR to enter into negotiations with allies to stop 
the importation of goods made with stolen intellectual property into 
the United States and allied countries. The theft of American 
intellectual property is becoming critical to our ability to be 
effectively competitive against China.
  This list goes on. This is a major Finance Committee title that will 
significantly strengthen U.S. competitiveness in response to the malign 
activities that we continuously see growing from China. I encourage all 
of my colleagues to support this important amendment.
  Before I finish, I want to say what I was going to say at the 
beginning of my remarks, and I alluded to it briefly. Senator Wyden and 
I have had a very close and strong negotiation going on, and I 
appreciate deeply the ability that we have to work together in a 
bipartisan fashion to build this, and we will be building other very 
important policies for this country. I just wanted to thank my 
colleague Senator Wyden for his partnership in this effort.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I, too, want to express my appreciation 
to Senator Crapo. We are partners in the Senate Finance Committee. As 
Senator Crapo really touched on, we know that sometimes around here in 
the Senate, it is hard to get Senators to agree on the proper way to 
butter a piece of toast. But what Senator Crapo and I have tried to 
show--and I believe this amendment does it--is that the Senate is going 
to come together on the urgency of outcompeting China, and that is what 
our legislation is all about.
  Senator Crapo ticked off a number of the key measures. Obviously we 
feel very strongly. We spent weeks looking at it in hearings and in 
discussions--at how China rips off our intellectual properties, steals 
technology, sends dangerous counterfeits to our market, and how it 
undercuts manufacturers with overproduction and unfair subsidies. The 
fact is, the Chinese have deployed massive subsidies, incentivized 
overproduction in key manufacturing sectors like steel, aluminum, and 
solar panels, that undercuts our competitors. They have shaken down 
American firms for intellectual property and stolen cutting-edge 
technology.
  Worst of all, colleagues, is the practice of forced labor, which we 
looked at in the Senate Finance Committee. It is morally repugnant on 
its own, and it is also a very substantial threat to American jobs.
  I do want to spend a moment on an area where we are going to be doing 
a lot more work, and I am going to have plenty to say about it before 
this bill becomes law; and that is, as my friend from Idaho just talked 
about, the Chinese Government&#x27;s great firewall. It blocks more than 
10,000 American websites and digital platforms, and others are 
subjected to extreme censorship. Americans who are blocked can only 
watch as Chinese homegrown competitors then rip off their very best 
ideas, thrive in the absence of real competition, and then grow into 
tech behemoths themselves.

  The catch is, as those Chinese-grown tech giants get bigger and 
bigger, using ripped-off American tech and ideas, they are also 
exporting their government&#x27;s intolerance of free speech.
  So in the case of the great firewall, we now have trade enforcement 
tools that really go back to the Dark Ages. Literally, some of them 
date back to some cases in the middle of the last century, and that, in 
no way, leaves us in a good position.
  As Senator Crapo and I have found--and we agreed in a bipartisan 
manner on this--it leaves us ill-prepared to handle the fast-moving 
world of digital trade, where there are a lot of high-skill, high-wage 
jobs on the line.
  So, for now, I hope Members of the Senate will strongly support this 
bipartisan amendment.
  As Senator Crapo said, we have a lot of other things we are going to 
tackle. As the Presiding Officer knows, I think what we talked about 
yesterday, in terms of clean energy, can build on ideas of both 
political parties. Senator Crapo has a very good idea for tech-neutral, 
private sector competition for clean energy. That is his idea. I am a 
Democrat, and I am acknowledging my colleague&#x27;s good ideas. So we have 
a lot to work with.

[[Page S3838]]

  But for today, when we pass this amendment, the Crapo-Wyden 
amendment, we are signaling that the entire Senate is coming together 
on a straightforward proposition, that we want to tell our constituents 
that we understand the urgency of outcompeting China, and that it is 
going to take key tools, which is what we have developed in the Senate 
Finance Committee.
  I urge all Senators to vote for this bipartisan amendment.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida


                           Amendment No. 1802

  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I want to take a moment to speak on my 
amendment, and I won&#x27;t take very long.
  First of all, really, my comments are geared toward somebody who 
might be watching or will maybe watch a video of this later because 
usually there aren&#x27;t a lot of mysteries here on the floor of Senate. 
And when these amendments come up, everybody kind of knows the way it 
is going to go. And this amendment that I am about to put forward here 
is probably not going to pass. I am pretty certain it won&#x27;t or we 
wouldn&#x27;t have gotten a vote on it. That is just the way it is.
  But that is OK because--it is not OK, but it is OK in the sense that 
I still want to take this opportunity to talk about this and have a 
vote on it.
  Let me just say this: If you go back 2, 3 years, I believe not the 
first but one of the first people here who talked about the need to do 
what much of this bill does was me. I have been talking now for 2 or 3 
years about the need for the American Government to step forward and 
partner with the private sector. I have been talking about the need for 
industrial policy.
  You can&#x27;t compete with a nation-state if the nation-state is not 
involved in the competition. And that is what we are involved in--a 
nation-state competition. And it does involve a massive amount of 
Chinese investment in research and development.
  And we have to step up to the plate. The days of believing that on 
some of these items the private market on its own will solve it, it is 
not possible at this scale and scope.
  I point to Operation Warp Speed. Would the private market have 
eventually given us a vaccine? It would have. But we needed it now. We 
stepped forward. We provided the money. The private sector responded. 
And today we are standing around here with no masks on, and much of the 
country is getting back to normal because we have vaccines.
  You could criticize a lot of things about what America did in the 
beginning of the pandemic, but we have done vaccines better than anyone 
in the world, and that would not have been possible without industrial 
policy, which is the partnership of government and business to solve an 
urgent crisis of a national concern.
  Well, when it comes to research, development, technology, that is 
perhaps the single greatest requirement before us today in terms of the 
future. The 21st century is going to be defined by this definition 
between China--this competition between China and the United States. 
And it is a competition we simply cannot win unless we step forward and 
match it.
  But another part of the Chinese approach to this is not simply to 
invest but to steal. As many of you know, I have been on the 
Intelligence Committee now for 10 years. I was acting chairman of it 
for a number of months and now the vice chairman in a committee that I 
think--maybe I am prejudiced in this view, but I think it is the best 
functioning committee here. I am sure some would disagree. But I think 
we do a lot of good work.
  And it comes on topic--and I spend a lot of time reading all of the 
intelligence every single day. Let me just describe my experiences over 
the last few years. It is a horror show.
  The Chinese are stealing our intellectual property. And it is not 
just, oh, they reverse engineered someone&#x27;s software; they steal the 
money the taxpayers are investing in basic research and development.
  We have a graph here. I have it up. The print is too small to see on 
camera, but I will describe it to you. Here is how they operate, use 
our universities. They prioritize--they steal priority technologies, 
leverage international openness of U.S. markets, universities, and 
institutes. They play scientists, researchers in universities, U.S. 
National Labs, for access to emerging and foundational research and 
access to dual-use export control technologies.
  It goes on to say, Chinese state-owned enterprises&#x27; front and shell 
companies partner with universities for access to IP, research data, 
technology, penetrate U.S. company supply chains. This is their 
strategy.
  Now, we were about to put $200 billion of American taxpayer money in 
more of that, in more of those activities. And you don&#x27;t think that 
they are going to do all of that against us? They are. And so it is 
incumbent upon us to make sure that we have in place safeguards so they 
cannot keep doing this to us.
  What is the point of putting up $200 billion of American public 
taxpayer money on pursuing all of this research if we are going to 
allow the Chinese to steal it? Nobody here wants them to steal it.
  And I know there have been improvements done in terms of upping the 
security. What I want you to understand is that this is not a minor 
security threat. This is the No. 1 priority of Chinese intelligence. 
This is their No. 1 priority. This is what all of their agencies and 
all of their government is geared toward doing. And we are going to put 
all this money in there and hope that the safeguards we put in place 
are going to work.
  I hope they do. But what if they don&#x27;t? What if a year from now we 
find out, or you are going to read in an article 2 years from now, 
whatever, that says: The Chinese have stolen a quarter--25, 30 percent 
of the IP developed by the money that has been put forward in the bill 
that was passed? Then we are all going to feel pretty stupid around 
here.
  That is the only thing I am aiming at. All I am asking in this 
amendment is that, at least in the initial stages of this program, that 
the Director of National Intelligence, the DNI, the DNI&#x27;s office, and 
the FBI have an opportunity to review these grants to ensure that they 
do not have embedded, in the place we are giving the money to, a 
scientist, a researcher at one of these National Labs or that there 
isn&#x27;t some shell company involved.
  Now, I know the argument. I have heard the argument against it from 
those who want to do the research. This is going to slow it down. It 
is.
  TSA slows down our ability to get on airplanes. Who wants to get rid 
of TSA? Cyber security slows down our ability to access our networks. 
But we need more of it, not less. Yes, security becomes burdensome. It 
slows things down. But I would rather do it slow or slower and own it 
than faster and have them steal it. And that is what this amendment 
does.
  I don&#x27;t know what the opposition to it is other than I understand 
that there are a lot who just want to get their hands on this money, 
and they want to get going very quickly. That is what they want to do, 
and that is great. That is what researchers want to do. They want to 
move fast. We need them to move fast. But our job is different. Our job 
is to see the problem holistically and understand, let&#x27;s move as fast 
as we can without allowing the Chinese to steal it
  So, look, I am asking everyone to vote against this motion to table 
because, frankly, I think we expose ourselves to a vulnerability. We 
are placing the faith that this existing system we have, and whatever 
new one we are starting up, is going to be able to withstand the force 
of the intelligence agencies of an entire nation-state and their No. 1 
objective, and that is how can we get our hands on whatever these $200 
billion are helping to innovate.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.
  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, speaking against this amendment, I 
know the Senator from Florida probably, given his intelligence work, 
wants to be well-meaning, but this amendment is not ready for the focus 
that we need to give on issues of counterintelligence.
  This amendment, as drafted, literally says that the Director of 
National Intelligence should look at and certify whether any of the 
entities given this money--including NASA, which would be given money 
under this bill--that they would have to certify for a 10-year period 
of time.

[[Page S3839]]

  So, literally, every institution, every organization that gets money 
under this bill would have to certify for a 10-year period of time that 
they didn&#x27;t have anything to do with a Chinese investment.
  I am all for investigating theft and intellectual property. In fact, 
the Senator from Mississippi and I added several provisions to our 
legislation. Other people have added things to this legislation. But do 
I want the Director of National Intelligence calling every university 
in the United States that might get money from this program and asking 
them to verify for the last 10 years what did they ever take as far as 
Chinese investment?
  I have news for you. I want the Director of National Intelligence to 
be focusing on cyber security. If somebody didn&#x27;t see, we have just had 
a major pipeline incident. It is not the first incident; it is many 
incidents in which foreign governments have threatened our Nation, our 
sources of power, basically, by infiltrating our system.
  I want the Director of National Intelligence to focus on Iran, to 
focus on Russia, to focus on North Korea, to focus on Syria, to focus 
on threats of terrorism. I want them to focus on monitoring our 
organizations nationwide. I do not want them spending their time 
calling university presidents and NASA officials asking them what they 
have done for the last 10 years and to verify before they can get the 
needed research dollars.
  Now, I know the Senator is trying to be well-meaning, and I am happy 
to work with him on this issue. But I know this: The race is on in 
semiconductors. The race is on in quantum computing. The race is on in 
AI. The race is on in other areas of manufacturing. And we cannot 
afford to have our Director of National Intelligence spending his time 
calling up these people when we have already implemented the securities 
in this legislation.
  I am happy to keep working with anybody on this issue. But, by God, I 
am telling you, we are going to be committed to doing more on our 
international threats on cyber security because, as you can see from 
this recent pipeline incident, that is where we should be spending our 
time and our focus, from a security perspective.
  I ask my colleagues to table the Rubio amendment.


                            Motion to Table

  Madam President, I ask for the regular order. And I ask to table the

                             Anti-Semitism

  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I have the opportunity to chair the U.S. 
Helsinki Commission.
  I am taking this time--I understand there is a break in the action in 
regards to the underlying bill. If I am wrong on that, I will yield the 
floor to someone in regards to moving us forward, but I understand that 
we are not ready for the next issue yet.
  So with that in mind, let me just take this time as the Chair of the 
U.S. Helsinki Commission representing the U.S. Senate. In the Helsinki 
Commission, my Republican counterpart is Senator Wicker. Senator 
Wicker, by the way, is the vice president of the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe&#x27;s Parliamentary Assembly, and I am 
the Special Representative on Anti-Semitism, Racism, and Intolerance.
  The Helsinki Final Act speaks very clearly against all forms of 
intolerance and discrimination. And we have seen in recent months 
current events trigger latent bias in our community.
  We go back to 9/11, where we saw the uprise of hate against the 
Muslim community, which was translated into violence against Muslim 
Americans.
  We saw during COVID-19 latent bias against the Asian-American 
community. As a result, we saw a rise of hate, of anti-Asian activity, 
bias, and violence, and this body took action.
  And, once again, as a result of recent violence in the Middle East, 
we see a rise of anti-Semitism here in the United States and around the 
world.
  I mention all of that because we need to speak out whenever we see 
the rise of intolerance in our community. So let me just talk about 
anti-Semitism and what has happened recently.

[[Page S3840]]

  A 29-year-old Jewish man was punched, kicked, and pepper-sprayed last 
week in New York in broad daylight, as a group of men yelled anti-
Semitic statements. People in cars began throwing bottles and yelling 
anti-Semitic slurs, including words like ``dirty Jew,&#x27;&#x27; at a dinner 
party in Los Angeles. In Skokie, IL, someone shattered a window at a 
synagogue. In Bal Harbour, FL, men yelled, ``Die Jew,&#x27;&#x27; at a man in a 
skull cap, and then threatened to rape his wife and daughter.
  These instances are compounded by an uptick in anti-Semitic speech 
online, with the Anti-Defamation League finding 17,000 tweets between 
May 7 and May 14--1 week--with some variation of the phrase: ``Hitler 
was right.&#x27;&#x27;
  These attacks follow the January 6 Capitol insurrection earlier this 
year, where White Supremacist and extremist groups displayed anti-
Semitic and racist symbols and recited conspiracy theories blaming Jews 
for the pandemic. These conspiracy theories have proliferated alongside 
anti-Semitic stereotypes and images being mainstreamed by some 
political leaders and public figures.
  While these events are shocking, perhaps we should not be surprised. 
The ADL Global Index on Anti-Semitism, updated in 2019, found that more 
than 1 billion people--nearly 1 in 8--around the world harbor anti-
Semitic attitudes.
  Over 30 percent of those surveyed said it was ``probably true&#x27;&#x27; that 
Jews have too much control over financial markets; that Jews think they 
are better than other people; that Jews are disloyal to their country; 
and that people hate Jews because of the way Jews behave. A full 41 
percent think Jews are more loyal to Israel than the country they live 
in.
  Such sentiments too often translate into violence, leaving 40 percent 
of European Jews to report in 2018 that they live in daily fear of 
being physically attacked. Here at home, Jews make up fewer than 3 
percent of the American population, but the majority of reported 
religious-based hate crimes targeted Jewish people and institutions.
  I strongly agree with ADL&#x27;s CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, who said last 
week:

       [W]e are witnessing a dangerous and drastic surge in anti-
     Jewish hate. . . . To those who choose to indulge in age-old 
     antisemitic tropes, exaggerated claims and inflammatory 
     rhetoric, it has consequences: attacks in real life on real 
     people targeted for no other reason than they are Jewish. 
     This is antisemitism, plain and simple. And it&#x27;s indisputably 
     inexcusable in any context.

  In 2004, I had the opportunity to represent America at the Berlin 
Conference on Anti-Semitism, where we developed an action plan to stand 
up against anti-Semitism. The very first recommendation coming out of 
the Berlin conference is that leaders must speak out against anti-
Semitism in any form; that leaders need to be heard. They cannot be 
silent. So I was very pleased when our President, Joe Biden, stated 
this past week:

       The recent attacks on the Jewish community are despicable, 
     and they must stop. I condemn this hateful behavior at home 
     and abroad--it&#x27;s up to all of us to give hate no safe harbor.

  Thank you, President Biden.
  I was proud of our colleague Senator Mazie Hirono, a leader in the 
Asian-American community, who posted on social media:

       I&#x27;ve said it before and I&#x27;ll say it again--an attack on one 
     of us is an attack on all of us. We all must condemn the 
     recent surge of antisemitic attacks in our country. Each of 
     us needs to stand up, speak out, and confront this hatred.

  At my last in-person OSCE meeting before COVID-19, I hosted an event 
with my European colleagues entitled ``Lessons From the Past, 
Leadership for the Future,&#x27;&#x27; where we spoke about the lessons from the 
Holocaust, including early warning signs from the past--some of which 
have been rising to the surface again. These early warning signs 
include the rise of populist leaders, demonizing of minorities, 
propagandizing of hate, and the neglect of refugee protections, which 
ultimately became the factors that resulted in genocide.
  This month, I chaired a Helsinki Commission hearing on preventing 
mass atrocities with Professor Timothy Snyder and the U.S. Holocaust 
Memorial Museum&#x27;s Center for the Prevention of Genocide director, Naomi 
Kikoler. This Center&#x27;s Early Warning Project provides an innovative 
risk assessment tool using quantitative and qualitative methods to 
spotlight countries where mass atrocities have not begun, but where the 
risk of such violence is high.
  The warning signs are there. My colleagues, we are painfully reminded 
of our past. The OSCE has repeatedly reaffirmed that hate crimes pose a 
threat to the security of individuals and society, given their 
potential to lead to conflict and violence on a wider scale. The spread 
of hateful ideology and recent acts of hate crimes and extremism across 
the OSCE region attest to this.
  In response, I have called for a plan of action to address violence 
and discrimination across the OSCE region, including here in the United 
States, so that we may have a more strategic and cross-border approach 
to addressing hate. I have also supported the OSCE initiatives that 
address security concerns of Jewish communities, including by improving 
relationships between law enforcement and justice institutions and 
vulnerable communities, educating communities on anti-Semitism and how 
to counter it, and building alliances with other communities to counter 
hate.
  Over the past decade, I have also worked to ensure that the State 
Department&#x27;s budget annually includes funding to fight anti-Semitism 
globally by creating civil society partnerships between the United 
States and Europe to work as allies to fight against anti-Semitism, 
racism, xenophobia, anti-Muslim bigotry, hostility to the LGBTQ-plus 
community, and other forms of hate. The United States should be a 
global leader in fighting such intolerance.
  It would be hypocritical for us as a nation to preach to the world 
against hate if we let it fester and grow here at home. Like a virus, 
as we all know too well, if hate exists in one country, it has the 
capacity to spread around the world.
  Therefore, I ask all my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting 
these efforts at home and abroad to achieve safe and just societies for 
all. Hate takes many forms, but none of them should be acceptable here 
in the United States of America or anywhere else in the world.
  With that, I yield the floor
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.


                                S. 1260

  Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I am very proud of where the Senate is 
headed today. It has taken well over a year-and-a-half for this bill to 
finally come together, to come to fruition. There have been many 
committees of jurisdiction that actively participated in this process, 
Members who have accommodated other Members, and I am proud of the work 
product that we have been developing here.
  I especially want to thank, as we head toward what I hope is final 
passage later on this evening, my legislative director, Lauren O&#x27;Brien; 
my national security adviser, Brandt Anderson; Dan Cheever, who worked 
on Commerce Committee, all manner of work for me. They have worked 
tirelessly with Senator Schumer&#x27;s staff and my colleagues on the 
Republican side to ensure that this day came about, and we got a 
positive outcome.
  Let me say a bit about this legislation. We Americans have always 
looked toward the frontier and forward to new horizons. Our ancestors 
chased them across a continent and to the sea. When the wilderness was 
no more, they followed them elsewhere--in workshops and laboratories 
and factories and on farms, in the air and beyond.
  Our spirit is restless. We prefer the difficult as Americans. We have 
never accepted limits or impossibilities in life. No, instead, we 
sought to cure disease to lift the human condition, to better 
understand the world around us, to constantly go faster and further in 
these and other endeavors. And we do these things always aware that the 
new knowledge that they bring will benefit mankind and make our Union 
stronger.
  But this spirit is not entirely ours alone. You see, there are others 
out there who also harbor bold ambitions, but they don&#x27;t share our 
democratic

[[Page S3841]]

values. Just days ago, Communist China orbited, landed, and deployed a 
rover on the surface of Mars. No other nation has done this. No other 
nation has done this. It was their first voyage to the red planet. It 
is only part of the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s ambitious space program. 
And it is another direct challenge to the United States of America.
  Now, this momentous event happens at a time when so many of our 
citizens feel overlooked, when the communities they call home are 
hollowing out, when trust in our civic institutions is eroding, and 
when our allegiance seems increasingly to our political tribes and not 
to one another as citizens for the common good.
  Let&#x27;s not kid ourselves. The Chinese Communist Party plans to exploit 
our difficulties and divisions. Their power and their capabilities are 
growing. They are, indeed, locked in a global competition with this 
great Nation, and they intend to win it. They intend to win it.
  They think of those of us in this Chamber as powerless to stop them 
and unable to prioritize our Nation&#x27;s long-term goals over our party&#x27;s 
short-term gains.
  So I ask you this: When future generations of Americans cast their 
gaze toward new frontiers, will they see a red flag planted on those 
new frontiers that is not our own?
  Today, we answer, unequivocally, no. Today, we declare our intention 
to win this century and those that follow it as well. Today, we 
demonstrate our faith in the American people to lead the way and vote 
to give them the tools to do so.
  This bill, this moment, is really not about beating China. It is 
really not about beating China. You see, the Endless Frontier Act is 
about using their challenge to become a better version of ourselves. It 
is about helping more Americans get more skin in the game, deploying 
their talents and untapped potential. It is about supercharging our 
economy as we emerge from this global pandemic which descended upon us 
from Communist China. It is about spreading the benefits of this 
economy far and wide and preparing and allowing more people, regardless 
of their circumstances or their place of birth, to meaningfully 
participate in the 21st century.
  It is about unleashing what Emma Lazarus called the imprisoned 
lightning across this land and aiding so many Americans in their 
pursuit of our common happiness.
  You see this is how we unite our Nation and tilt the balance of a 
great power struggle westward. This is how we become the first to reach 
the next great horizon.
  Let history record that at this moment we stood united. We declared 
with solemn purpose and single voice that this is our destination; that 
by confronting the challenges of today, we built a brighter tomorrow; 
and that a new generation of doers and dreamers pressed America on, 
once again, toward the endless frontier.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.


                        Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act

  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I was tremendously proud and grateful to be at the 
bill signing last week in the East Room of the White House with the 
President of the United States, at his side when he put his approval on 
a measure that took years to pass, the NO HATE Act--known as the 
Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act, named after Khalid Jabara and Heather Heyer, 
who perished as a result of the most vicious and vile hate crimes in 
this Nation&#x27;s history. The occasion was centered on legislation 
addressing protection for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. It was 
a tremendously moving and powerful event when the President spoke 
passionately and unequivocally that hate has no safe harbor in the 
United States.

  I was reminded of those moments with the President of the United 
States as I witnessed just very recently this surge in anti-Semitic 
hate crimes across this country. We have seen them again and again and 
again. The Anti-Defamation League has been tracking anti-Semitic 
incidents in the country since 1979, and the past three annual reports 
have included two of its highest tallies. Last year&#x27;s report recorded 
more than 1,200 incidents--a 10-percent increase from the previous 
year.
  These assaults and insults, brawls, and vicious desecrations have 
occurred across the country to individuals in synagogues and places of 
worship, and we should be rising to condemn them now unequivocally and 
clearly, condemn all of these acts of hate, because we are all in this 
perilous time together.
  We know from the acts of hatred directed against Asian Americans that 
they follow similar kinds of assaults and incidents involving Muslim 
Americans, Black Americans, and Jewish Americans. An assault on one is 
an assault on all of us. But the assaults and the acts of hatred 
against Jewish Americans have been particularly vile and venomous over 
these last 2, 4 weeks and months. We have seen not only the physical 
attacks but also Holocaust denial and distortion, including intentional 
efforts to excuse or minimize the impact of the Holocaust.
  These kinds of vicious and intolerable statements have grown. That is 
one reason why I continue to support the Never Again Education Act, 
which was signed into law almost 1 year ago, to expand the United 
States Holocaust Museum education programming and the development and 
dissemination of accurate, relevant, and accessible resources to 
improve awareness and understanding of the Holocaust. But prevention 
through education is not enough. We must do more. We must act.
  What is most important to remember about every one of these incidents 
is that they involve real people, real communities, and real victims 
whose lives are torn apart in the most heartbreaking cases. They 
involve real lives that are lost forever and real families who will 
never see their loved ones again.
  That is what happened to the families of Khalid Jabara and Heather 
Heyer. They were in the East Room of the White House with us, 
graciously and generously lending their presence, their faces, and 
their voices to this effort against hate crime. They expressed 
gratitude for the actions we are taking.
  Now we must move forward to provide the funding for the NO HATE Act 
so we have greater reporting of these vicious acts and so that we have 
better training and more prevention and action--not just condemnation 
but action against anti-Semitism in this country.
  I read recently that a 5-year-old was constructing a Lego of a 
synagogue and, using those Legos, added a security force around the 
synagogue. What kind of America is it that requires a 5-year-old 
building a place of worship out of Legos to include a police security 
guard? And what kind of America is it that has double the number of 
reported anti-Semitic harassment, vandalism, and violence just over a 
2-week period most recently when there were clashes in Israel and Gaza? 
It is not the America we know and love, and it is not the America we 
deserve.
  We must do better, and I know my colleagues share this view. I heard 
and saw my friend and colleague Senator Cardin speak powerfully on this 
issue just moments ago. We know that we as a body can take action 
because hate is contagious, but so is courage. We must provide all of 
the people who have courage and good will in this country with the kind 
of support that we can, that we must, and that we will to fight anti-
Semitism and to make sure that this America is the one that we know and 
love and that my father came to believe in as an immigrant at the age 
of 17 when he escaped persecution in Germany, coming here at 17 years 
old in 1935 with not much more than the shirt on his back, knowing no 
one, speaking virtually no English, but believing in that America that 
would provide him freedom and opportunity and, yes, protection against 
exactly the kind of anti-Semitism whose beginnings are in those kinds 
of vile and vicious assaults and words we see around the world today.
  Let us all come together and fight anti-Semitism just as we have done 
with the hate crimes against our brother and sister Asian Americans and 
make sure that our country is the one that we know and love.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York


                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1520

  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise today to once again ask that 
every Senator have a chance to consider and cast their vote on the 
Military Justice

[[Page S3842]]

Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act.
  This bill would ensure that when crimes are committed in our 
military, justice is delivered. This commonsense reform, which has 
bipartisan, filibuster-proof support, moves the decision on whether to 
prosecute serious crimes to independent, trained, and professional 
military prosecutors, while leaving misdemeanors and uniquely military 
crimes within the chain of command. In other words, it takes the same 
approach to criminal justice that the military takes in most other 
areas of operation. It puts highly technical work in the hands of 
trained specialists.
  This is not a new concept. I first introduced a similar form of this 
legislation in 2013.
  This is not a new idea that requires hypothetical thinking. This 
system or a version of it is already being used by our allies around 
the world to positive effect. Australia has moved charging decisions 
for serious crimes from the chain of command to the director of 
military prosecutions, as has Canada, New Zealand, and Ireland. In 
France, charging decisions are made by lawyers, not by commanders. 
Germany tries military cases in civilian courts with civilian 
authorities. In Italy, charging decisions are made by judge advocates, 
who are fully independent of the chain of command. The Netherlands 
assigns charging decisions to public prosecutors with broad experience 
in military cases. Norway uses military prosecuting authority for 
criminal offenses by military personnel. The UK moved serious crimes 
out of the chain of command in 2009 as part of an effort to provide an 
independent and impartial tribunal to the accused. In Israel, charging 
decisions are made by judge advocates whose sole commander is the 
military advocate general, a general officer.
  I will note that the Israeli system is almost identical to the 
procedures set forth in our bill. Israel has not seen a decrease in 
good order and discipline and, in fact, has seen increased reporting 
and faith in their military justice system.
  These countries took serious crimes out of the chain of command 
because they believed that defendants have a right to civil liberties. 
They recognized that servicemembers deserve a trial not led by a 
commander, who often has no legal experience or education, but by 
trained criminal lawyers.
  When they made these changes, they did not see a diminution in 
command control or the ability to maintain good order and discipline 
within their ranks. In fact, when we stop asking commanders to act as 
judge and jury in complex cases, they will have more time to focus on 
rebuilding the trust and cohesion among their ranks that we know is 
critical to military readiness.
  We pride ourselves on having the best military in the world. To 
maintain it, we need to do more to make it safe for everyone to serve. 
Our allies have already done this. Every day we don&#x27;t act is a day we 
fall further behind on this front.
  This is a tried and tested system. It has delivered change for our 
allies that the incremental reforms put in place by the Armed Services 
Committee have not delivered to our servicemembers. This reform has 
been tested; requested by survivors, veterans, and commanders; backed 
by experts in military justice; and supported by 65 Senators. There is 
no reason to delay a vote on the floor any further.
  I ask unanimous consent that, at a time to be determined by the 
majority leader in consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate 
Armed Services Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 
1520 and the Senate proceed to its consideration; that there be 2 hours 
for debate equally divided in the usual form; and that upon the use or 
yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the bill with no 
intervening action or debate.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  Mr. REED. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. For the 
reasons I articulated on Monday and remain, I think, accurate, I would 
object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.
  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I would like to actually give some 
information to the chairman about what these other nations&#x27; leaders 
have actually said about this issue.
  Major General Blaise Cathcart, advocate general of the Canadian Armed 
Forces, wrote:

       The 1999 changes to the military justice system were battle 
     tested in the theater of active operations and, in my view, 
     were a key contributor to combat effectiveness of the 
     Canadian armed forces. The current military justice system 
     contributed substantially to the fielding and sustainment of 
     a disciplined and efficient force with high morale.

  Air Commander Paul Cronan, director general of the Australian Defense 
Force Legal Service:

       At this point, it&#x27;s appropriate to reflect on the effect of 
     the reforms made to the Australian military justice system in 
     2003 and 2006. These reforms have undoubtedly had a 
     significant and positive impact on the efficacy, 
     impartiality, and perceived fairness of Australia&#x27;s military 
     justice system. This is a fact confirmed by a number of 
     subsequent independent reviews of the effectiveness of the 
     2003 and 2006 reforms. As a result of their independent 
     review, they concluded that the reforms had been effective, 
     and that as a result of these reforms, ``The military justice 
     system is delivering and should continue to deliver 
     impartial, rigorous, and fair outcomes. Enhanced transparency 
     and enhanced oversight is substantially more independent from 
     the chain of command, and is effective in maintaining a high 
     standard of discipline both domestically and in the 
     operational theater.&#x27;&#x27;

  In the UK, Commander Andrei Spence, Commodore Naval Legal Service, 
Royal Navy, UK:

       Probably the most pressing question that you need answering 
     from me, and if I may preempt it slightly at the risk of 
     being too forthcoming, is what&#x27;s the effect on command of our 
     changes? How do they view it? Do they feel disempowered, 
     disenfranchised? I have to say that the simple answer to that 
     is no.

  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter this testimony into 
the Record
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

                        MJIIPA: Allies Testimony


   Maj. Gen. Blaise Cathcart, Advocate General of the Canadian Armed 
                                 Forces

       ``The Canadian armed forces require a robust and fair 
     military justice system to investigate, prosecute, and 
     adjudicate allegations of sexual assault. As the 
     superintendent of the administration of the Canadian military 
     justice system, I am confident our system meets the 
     disciplinary needs of the chain of command while addressing 
     the interests of victims and reflecting the constitutionality 
     protected Canadian values of fairness, transparency, and the 
     rule of law . . . The 1999 changes to the military justice 
     system were battle tested in the theater of active operations 
     and, in my view were a key contributor to the combat 
     effectiveness of the Canadian armed forces. The current 
     military justice system contributed substantially to the 
     fielding and sustainment of a disciplined and efficient force 
     with high morale.&#x27;&#x27;


  Maj. Gen. Steve Noonan, Deputy Commander, Canadian Joint Operations 
                                Command

       ``My intent is simply to inform the Panel that as an 
     operational commander, I&#x27;m very comfortable with where we 
     have evolved to, recognizing the continued key role of the 
     commanding officer in the system, and the latitude that the 
     system still provides for us to maintain good order and 
     discipline, two key elements of operational effectiveness . . 
     . In terms of the role of the commanding officer in the court 
     martial process, in sensitive matters, like an alleged sexual 
     assault, we believe it is in the best interest of the chain 
     of command, the accused, and the complainant to have an 
     independent investigator assess the evidence and lay charges, 
     an independent prosecutor determine whether or not to 
     proceed, and an independent court martial administrator 
     convene a court martial. All of these actors, in my view, 
     strengthen my role in the chain of command as those under my 
     command can be confident in the real and perceived 
     independence of the military justice system.&#x27;&#x27;

  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.


                           Amendment No. 2103

  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to support amendment No. 2103, 
which addresses a very important issue in the world, which is the issue 
of governments that undertake to destroy populations, either in other 
countries or within their own country; that is, to commit genocide.
  Now, this topic comes up because China is committing genocide against 
its own Uighur population--a million Uighurs who are enslaved, who are 
trapped, who are assaulted in every possible way by the official 
authorities operating out of Beijing.
  The finding of genocide is one that the State Department takes very 
seriously. It involves long investigations, collection of evidence, 
analysis. It is not something to say lightly. But we now have two 
Secretaries of State who have led our State Department through this 
process and reached the same conclusion--Secretary Pompeo, under 
President Trump, and Secretary Blinken, under President Biden. And both 
find that this is, in fact, genocide.
  Now, at this very moment, athletes are preparing to compete in the 
Olympic Games in China, and I find it horrific that the prestige of the 
Games is going to be carried on for a country that is committing 
genocide.
  Now, we have a Commission that works on human rights issues, known as 
the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, and it hauls a whole 
team of experts who work to analyze human rights issues. This 
commission, which is bipartisan and bicameral and includes executive 
branch appointees, when they are actually appointed, has held a 
hearing.
  At that hearing, various experts came and testified on what China is 
doing. It reinforced what the Secretary of State under our former 
President and the Secretary of State under our current President found: 
Genocide is being conducted by the government in China against the 
Uighur population
  And that is not all China is doing. There are other afflicted groups 
that it is assaulting. In addition, it has proceeded to start stripping 
the political rights of the people of Hong Kong.
  It is very much in the news. We have seen the citizens protesting in 
the streets, hundreds of thousands, saying: China, honor the commitment 
you made when Britain transferred Hong Kong back under a 50-year 
agreement to China.
  And China has not honored that agreement.
  Now, China, when it was awarded the Games back in 2015 to be held in 
2022--7 years in advance--made human rights promises to the 
International Olympic Committee--promises that have not been upheld. In 
fact, during those years, China has become an even worse violator of 
human rights in Hong Kong, in Xinjiang, and in other ethnic areas, 
including Tibet.
  So we have echoes of 1936--the year the summer Olympics were held in 
Germany and Hitler was in charge. He used those Olympic Games to shine 
prestige on his country and to essentially help distract enormously 
from his already horrific actions against Jewish Germans and other 
groups within Germany.
  So how is it here, nearly a century later, that, again, the Olympics 
are going to be used to shine a little bit of light and a lot of 
prestige on a country engaged in genocide?
  I want to compliment my colleague Senator Romney of Utah. He has 
placed in the underlying bill, as it came out of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, a provision that says: When the Olympics are held, there 
should be a diplomatic boycott to protest and draw attention to this 
egregious situation. I hope, also, that the sponsors of those games 
will start to withdraw their sponsorships.
  Now, my friend and colleague Senator Romney is an expert on the 
Olympic Games because he organized the Olympic Games in Utah. Nobody in 
America probably knows more about what it takes to prepare for them. 
And it is not, at this moment, possible for the structure that has been 
established to host the athletes to be redone and to pivot for just 
next year, which I find unfortunate, but I understand the point.
  So let&#x27;s do this together. Let&#x27;s send a strong message to the Olympic 
Committee, the IOC, that never again should they allow a country to 
host the Olympic Games that is engaged in genocide. This should be a 
message that every American can say together--that never should a 
country be given the prestige of hosting the games when they are 
committing genocide. Never should a country be able to host the games 
when it is something like what China is doing to the Uighur 
population--enslaving them, stripping them of their dignity, their 
autonomy, their culture, controlling them in every way, enslaving them. 
Never again should the Games be able to be hosted by a country like 
China that is restricting the political rights of Hong Kong--what China 
is doing, stripping the freedom of speech, stripping the freedom of 
assembly, and breaking the deal that it signed when the deal was struck 
with Britain for the return of Hong Kong.
  So this amendment, cosponsored by Senator Rubio, who is the cochair 
in the Senate of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China; 
cosponsored by Senator Romney, who knows more about the Olympic Games 
than anybody else in this country; cosponsored by Senator Young, who 
has been a terrific champion against the abuse of citizens in Yemen and 
the abuse of citizens in Burma--let&#x27;s adopt this amendment as part of 
this package while we are on the topic of China, while we are on the 
topic of trade.
  Let&#x27;s not let this moment bypass us without saying with a unified 
voice that this is wrong, and that the Olympics, which were designed to 
lift up the human spirit, to celebrate the best of competition, to have 
kind of the thrills and the agonies of victory and defeat--that never 
should the Games, the focal point of world attention, be hosted by a 
country that is committing genocide.
  Thank you.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.


                          January 6 Commission

  Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, colleagues, this coming Monday is 
Memorial Day. Many of us are making our plans to commemorate the 
holiday, the weekend, where we honor those who made the ultimate 
sacrifice in defense of our Nation and in defense of our democracy--
those brave Americans and so many others who have worked, fought, and 
died for more than 200 years to protect our system of government--of 
the people, by the people, for the people. Upholding that legacy is our 
highest duty, and it is in that spirit that I rise today.
  On November 3, 2020, I was serving as California&#x27;s secretary of 
state. It was my privilege for 6 years to serve as the chief elections 
officer in our Nation&#x27;s most populous and most diverse State, and I can 
tell you that even in the best of times, election administration is 
complex. Elections are consequential operations.
  Last year, our elections workers at all levels of government faced 
the additional, unprecedented challenge of administering an election 
during a global health pandemic. And I am proud to say that they rose 
to the occasion to protect the democratic legacy that we hold and 
trust. And, as a result, California&#x27;s election officials administered 
an accessible, secure, and safe election, which drew historic voter 
turnout. Indeed, by every objective measure, the 2020 elections were a 
national success.
  But none of this mattered to President Trump, who had spent years 
attacking the integrity of our elections by repeatedly lying about 
voter fraud and ``rigged elections,&#x27;&#x27; even the election that he won in 
2016.
  President Trump was furious at his 2020 loss, and he chose to take a 
sledgehammer to the core of our democratic system. He didn&#x27;t just 
refuse to concede the election--breaking a tradition that dates back to 
Thomas Jefferson--President Trump attacked the very notion of a 
peaceful transition of power.

[[Page S3844]]

  Along the way, he filed and lost more than 60 cynical lawsuits 
challenging the election. He personally called State elections 
officials and pressured them to alter vote tallies--tallies that had 
been counted, recounted, and audited.
  And he lied to the American people, tweeting out a steady stream of 
conspiracy theories and disinformation denying his electoral loss.
  Online and around the country, President Trump&#x27;s Big Lie caught fire. 
Sadly, many Republican officials participated in fanning the flames, 
spreading fears of voter fraud for political gain. Others stood by 
silently as President Trump radicalized his supporters with falsehoods. 
They chose loyalty to Trump over the truth, delusion over democracy.
  Let me be clear. These allegations of fraud had no basis in fact. 
They were rooted in Trump&#x27;s ego and cemented in White supremacy. And 
they led directly to the deadly insurrection of January 6, an 
unprecedented attack on our Nation&#x27;s Capitol by violent extremists 
against the U.S. House of Representatives and this Senate, invited and 
incited by the President of the United States.
  Armed rioters brutally beat Capitol Police officers and stormed this 
building. The Confederate flag, the symbol of violent White supremacy, 
flew inside this Capitol for the first time in our Nation&#x27;s history. 
Members of militarized hate groups searched these hallways with the 
intent to kill elected leaders of both parties. They made their way to 
this very floor to try to stop the certification of the Presidential 
election, and in so doing, they terrorized our staff, Capitol Police, 
the free press, our citizens across the country, and our democracy 
itself.
  Through their violence, the January 6 rioters disrupted our democracy 
at the behest of President Trump, and our Nation lost the right to call 
the transition of power peaceful.
  Now we gather in the wake of this armed insurrection, the deadly 
insurrection. The scars of January 6 can still be seen throughout the 
building. Yet many of my Republican colleagues say: We just need to 
move on. Let&#x27;s just move forward.
  They say that this deadly attack was simply a group of ``peaceful 
protesters&#x27;&#x27; on a ``normal tourist visit&#x27;&#x27;? They claim that the 
proposed Commission to investigate the January 6 insurrection is 
unnecessary because we have already increased Capitol security and our 
congressional committees are already investigating this attack.
  These arguments are outrageous. Of course we need an independent 
Commission to fully investigate the causes of the attack. We need to 
know the whole truth about January 6. We need and the American people 
deserve an independent, bipartisan investigation that will give us the 
facts and allow us to begin the hard work of restoring public trust in 
our democracy. It is the only way to ensure that an attack like this 
does not happen again.
  The bipartisan bill we are considering is modeled after the 
bipartisan 9/11 Commission. Imagine arguing in the wake of 9/11 that 
the only problem that we needed to address was airport security. That 
is how ridiculous this counterargument is. To brush aside the January 6 
attack on the American people would be the ultimate dereliction of our 
duty.
  Colleagues, we swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution 
of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. So I 
call on my Republican colleagues to live up to that oath, live up to 
that sacred duty. And if you cannot, if your hand is frozen by fear of 
those who were misled to believe that the election was stolen, if your 
hand is frozen out of fear of the President who sold that lie, then the 
insurrectionists have succeeded.
  I urge the Senate to authorize the January 6 Commission on a 
bipartisan vote, but if our Republican colleagues refuse to join us, 
then we will face another choice: Do we continue to defend our system 
of self-government or defend the filibuster? The stakes could not be 
higher. The choice could not be clearer. The peaceful transition of 
power must be defended.
  Colleagues, this is a moment where we must put country over politics, 
put the institutions of our democracy over the abuse of the filibuster. 
On January 6, our government was attacked, and now the future of our 
democracy is on the line. Let&#x27;s act like it.
  I yield the floor
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.


                                S. 1260

  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor very briefly 
today to thank Chairman Menendez and Ranking Member Risch for the great 
work they did on the Foreign Relations Committee to add to the pending 
legislation a title developed in the Foreign Relations Committee that 
makes sure that we are building the kinds of capacities inside the 
State Department and USAID that are able to make sure America can 
compete with China and a host of other developing, advancing nations 
all around the world.
  The fact is, we are often fighting our competitors with one hand tied 
behind our back. For instance, the size of the Chinese international 
development bank dwarfs the capacities of the similar institution that 
is used by the United States of America, the DFC.
  We have added new capacities to the DFC in this legislation that will 
allow the United States of America to be able to make sure that we can 
do development deals around the world and compete with other nations 
that are fast investing significant amounts of money and trying to use 
that money as leverage to gain political interest and political 
influence.
  Included in that title, midwifed through the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, is a provision that builds upon the expectation that 
Congress should have that the administration share with us agreements 
that they have entered into on behalf of the United States. If we want 
to play our constitutional role to be a coequal branch with the 
executive on the setting of American foreign policy, then, of course, 
this body needs to have access--immediate access--to any agreements, 
whether they be binding or nonbinding, that the Federal Government, 
through the executive branch, has entered into on behalf of the 
American people.
  I am very pleased that the legislation includes a requirement that, 
in an expeditious manner, the executive branch, whether there is a 
Republican President or a Democratic President, share with Congress any 
agreements that they have entered into on behalf of our constituents.
  That section of the bill goes a little bit further than that, though. 
It also says that the administration shall notify Congress anytime that 
the administration is beginning a negotiation over a prospective 
agreement with a foreign nation. Again, that, on its face, makes a lot 
of sense, the idea that the administration should be communicating with 
Congress when they have begun a significant negotiation with a foreign 
country that may ultimately obligate the United States or this Congress 
with respect to an international agreement.
  I raised, during the consideration of this bill in the Foreign 
Relations Committee and I have continued to raise both publicly and 
privately, concerns I have that I think are shared by current and 
former diplomats that there is a potential that by going too far in our 
request that the administration inform us of negotiations, we could 
provide a chill on both our government&#x27;s willingness to enter into what 
are sometimes very sensitive, early negotiations with foreign 
governments but also a chill on foreign nations&#x27; interest in entering 
into negotiations with the United States of America if they were to 
understand that anytime they began a conversation with the United 
States about a very sensitive matter, there would be a notification to 
Congress that could easily become public.
  In fact, there are good reasons sometimes where the executive branch, 
early on in a negotiation, before they know whether it is even going to 
become an agreement a year, 2 years down the line, would want the space 
to conduct that negotiation without the public eye coming down on those 
proceedings.
  So I think there is a way to get this right. I think that we want to 
make

[[Page S3845]]

sure that any agreements are sent to Congress. I can even understand 
how, in some circumstances, when you are talking about big negotiations 
of national significance, we would want to know at some point when 
those negotiations have begun. But I think you have to understand that 
there are two equities at play here. One is transparency, the right of 
Congress to get information from the executive branch, but the other 
equity is that we don&#x27;t want to do anything here that would 
disincentivize diplomacy, that would create a massive bureaucracy 
inside the State Department that would serve as a barrier to 
negotiations with countries that may avoid a war or may end up in a 
more efficient expenditure of U.S. taxpayer dollars.
  So I want to raise this concern about this language that is included 
in the substitute amendment. I know that there is a long way before 
this bill is law. Obviously, the House will take up their own version, 
and there will be some reconciliation between the House and the Senate. 
And I am glad to have Senator Menendez&#x27;s commitment to continue to have 
this discussion to make sure that we balance these equities--the equity 
of Congress&#x27;s right to know with the equity to invest and incentivize 
in American diplomacy.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.


                          Tribute to Lynn Aas

  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, it is a great honor for me today to 
recognize a North Dakota legend who is celebrating his 100th birthday 
on June 4. Lynn Aas, of Minot, is one of our State&#x27;s most treasured 
residents. With his engaging personality and deep commitment to public 
service, Lynn has experienced many great moments in our State&#x27;s and in 
our Nation&#x27;s history.
  Lynn was raised during the Great Depression on a farm near the town 
of Benedict, 40 miles south of Minot. He earned law and business 
degrees from the University of North Dakota, managed a medical clinic, 
served in the North Dakota Legislature for 8 years, and was a delegate 
to the State&#x27;s 1972 Constitutional Convention. He and his late wife 
Beverly raised four sons. To this day, Lynn remains active in his 
community.
  With all that has been so remarkable about Lynn&#x27;s life, it is his 
service during World War II that resonates the most with those who know 
him. Like with so many other young North Dakotans, the Japanese attack 
on Pearl Harbor in December of 1941 changed the course of Lynn&#x27;s life.
  In August 1942, Lynn had just finished his first year of college when 
he enlisted in the U.S. Army. He began basic training in March 1943 and 
became part of the 193rd Glider Infantry Regiment of the 17th Airborne 
Division. Following intensive training stateside, he boarded a ship in 
Boston in August 1944 heading to Liverpool, England.
  Lynn&#x27;s first combat experience was the Battle of the Bulge, one of 
the costliest battles in American history, with more than 80,000 U.S. 
casualties, including 19,000 American soldiers killed. His division and 
unit were flown to France and transported by trucks to Bastogne on 
December 24, 1944. His platoon entered combat on January 7, fighting in 
deep snow, frigid cold, and heavy fog. Beginning with 55 troopers, Lynn 
was one of only 5 survivors to leave the frontlines 3 weeks later.
  The end of January brought his first 2 nights of sleep under a roof 
in 5 weeks.
  In February, his platoon fought along the Siegfried Line on Nazi 
Germany&#x27;s border.
  Later in March, he participated in Operation Varsity, the last large-
scale Allied airborne operation of the war. There, he was towed in a 
glider and landed behind enemy lines near Wesel, Germany.
  Lynn&#x27;s combat days ended on March 25 when he was wounded in his left 
arm by shrapnel. Following extensive recuperation back in America, Lynn 
remained in the Army another 5 months until he was honorably discharged 
on November 1, 1945.
  For his valor and commendable 18 months of service during World War 
II, he was awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star medals, in addition 
to the Glider Badge, Combat Infantryman&#x27;s Badge, Good Conduct Medal, 
American Campaign Medal, European Campaign Medal with one Bronze 
Arrowhead and three Bronze Campaign Stars, and the World War II Victory 
Medal.
  Later in his life, Lynn attend reunions of the 17th Airborne 
Division. In 1999, he visited Europe with other 17th Airborne Division 
veterans, visiting the locations where they had fought more than 55 
years earlier.
  In 2015, he visited Belgium again to commemorate the 70th anniversary 
of the Battle of the Bulge. As one of the official representatives from 
the United States to this observance, Lynn was greeted by many grateful 
Belgians who had not forgotten what American soldiers did to liberate 
them from Hitler&#x27;s tyranny.
  In 2017, the French Government awarded Lynn its highest honor, the 
Knight of the Legion of Honor medal--an award created by Napoleon in 
1802. It was my great honor to be at that commemoration. The letter 
from the French Government notifying Lynn of this award carried these 
poignant words:

       73 years ago, you gave your youth to France and the French 
     people. Many of your fellow soldiers did not return but they 
     remain in our hearts. . . . You saved us. We will never 
     forget. For us, the French people, you are a hero. Gratitude 
     and remembrance are forever in our souls.

  Mr. President, Lynn Aas was one of 60,000 North Dakotans to serve in 
the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II. Of those, nearly 2,000 gave 
their lives for our freedom in this largest and deadliest conflict in 
world history. With only some 500 World War II veterans still alive in 
North Dakota, the heroism of every single one of them is appreciated 
more than ever.
  Throughout his life, Lynn Aas has embodied the best of the ``greatest 
generation.&#x27;&#x27; He has lived a meaningful life, sharing his history as a 
World War II soldier throughout so the rest of us can better understand 
and appreciate the selfless service and sacrifice of every veteran.
  On behalf of all North Dakotans, I wish Lynn Aas a very happy 100th 
birthday on June 4 and many more years of health and vitality. As he 
celebrates with his large family and many friends in Minot, I honor him 
as one of North Dakota&#x27;s most exemplary citizens.
  I yield back.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized
  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would like to thank our friend Senator 
Cramer for telling us this story about this great American patriot. 
Many of us are of that age where we are the children of members of the 
``greatest generation&#x27;&#x27; who have their own stories to tell. Just 
listening to Senator Cramer talk about this great patriot who fought at 
the Battle of the Bulge, one of the most horrific battles in World War 
II and most consequential battles--that is really where they really 
stopped Hitler, finally, toward the end of the war--it reminds me of 
people like my dad who flew B-17s out of England during the last part 
of the war. Their job was to knock out the Hitler war machine. But 
there are so many great stories from that generation. These great World 
War II patriots are getting older, and they are leaving us, but 
certainly we will always remember them and their contributions. So I 
appreciate the Senator from North Dakota sharing that with us.


                                S. 1260

  Mr. President, the Senate is moving quickly, I hope, toward a vote on 
a far-reaching proposal to confront threats from China. Based on 
everything we know about the might and the ambitions of the Chinese 
Communist Party, there is a clear and urgent need for us to take 
action.
  Every year, the U.S. intelligence community issues a threat 
assessment report outlining the greatest challenges confronting our 
country on the horizon. Topping the latest report, which was released 
last month, is China&#x27;s push for global power. The report outlines 
China&#x27;s efforts to strengthen its military power, diversify its nuclear 
arsenal, and fine-tune its cyber espionage skills, which are already 
quite considerable.
  One major area that cannot be overlooked is China&#x27;s industrial 
policy. Through the CCP&#x27;s Made in China 2025 initiative, it seeks to 
achieve China&#x27;s dominance in high-tech manufacturing. For everything 
from electric cars to advanced robotics, to artificial

[[Page S3846]]

intelligence, to quantum computing, China wants to lead global 
production, and they are throwing serious money into the effort to get 
there. China is expected to spend $1.4 trillion by 2025, covering 
investments in everything from 5G to artificial intelligence.
  The 2021 threat assessment report raises alarm bells here too. It 
says China will maintain these efforts because ``Chinese leaders see 
this strategy as necessary to reduce dependence on foreign 
technologies, enable military advances, and sustain economic growth and 
thus ensure the CCP&#x27;s survival.&#x27;&#x27; I view this as both an alarming 
statement but really more as a call to action. If China is making these 
kinds of investments to increase its independence and global presence, 
we should be investing in our industrial base and our national security 
here at home. The most important place to start, I believe, is with 
semiconductor manufacturing.
  The pandemic is hopefully soon to be in our rearview mirror as more 
and more Americans, more and more people get vaccinated. One of the 
most important lessons I believe we should have learned is the 
vulnerability of our supply chains, everything from personal protective 
equipment, most of which is made in China--and in the global race to 
get the PPE we needed during the pandemic, China got a head start 
because China manufactured it and we did not here at home.
  So that opened up my eyes to the vulnerability of that supply chain, 
but we can&#x27;t stop there. We need to look at how heavily we rely on 
other countries for semiconductors because nearly 90 percent of the 
semiconductors in the world are made in Southeast Asia, with Taiwan 
dominating the market. In fact, one company, Taiwan Semiconductor 
Manufacturing Company, accounted for more than one-half of total 
foundry revenues last year. Companies in Taiwan control 63 percent of 
the advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the world.
  Now, if you are like me, before I got involved in this issue, I 
didn&#x27;t really know very much about semiconductors, so I asked my staff 
to explain to me the significance of this vulnerability. They said: 
Well, Senator, think of it this way: Everything with an off and on 
switch involves semiconductors.
  Well, that helped me quite a bit. Then I asked them to research 
something for me. I said: You see those rockets that are raining down 
on Israel from Hamas? Some of those interceptors are made by Raytheon, 
an American-based defense contractor. Ask them how many semiconductors 
are in a single interceptor.
  They did the research, and they reported back--750 semiconductors in 
a single interceptor.
  So these semiconductors or microelectronics are everywhere, 
everywhere--in the phones we carry, in the planes that our Air Force, 
Navy, and Marines are flying, the fifth-generation stealth fighter, the 
F-35. Semiconductors are everywhere. Given China&#x27;s ambitions, it is 
easy to imagine how they might be tempted to interfere with the supply 
chain and our dependence on Asian-produced semiconductors. If China 
were to block or even invade Taiwan, we would be literally helpless.
  Back in 1980, Jimmy Carter gave a speech in which he laid down what 
came to be known as the Carter Doctrine. This was 2 years after the 
Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. He wanted to send a message to the 
world that they should not mess with U.S. access to the oil that came 
through the Strait of Hormuz in the Middle East.
  So he laid down the Carter doctrine. He said: Anybody who interferes 
with our access to the oil that we need to power our armed services and 
our economy, that would be an act of war. Well, I don&#x27;t think it is an 
exaggeration to say if another country were to block our access to 
semiconductors, it could well rise to the same sort of act of war that 
Jimmy Carter warned about in 1980. In other words, semiconductors have 
become the new oil in terms of our dependency, and it is a dangerous 
dependency we must correct.
  This is precisely why the senior Senator from Virginia and I, Senator 
Warner, introduced the CHIPS for America Act. It is crucial that we 
shore up our dependence on chips manufactured overseas and we shore up 
our domestic production.
  The vast majority of our colleagues have agreed that this is a 
critical task. It was carefully crafted after monthslong bipartisan, 
bicameral negotiations. Recently, we had a meeting at the White House, 
and President Biden agreed with us that this was a critical imperative. 
This is literally a bipartisan, bicameral agreement with the executive 
branch and legislative branch that this is something we need to fix.
  Last fall, when we took up the National Defense Authorization Act, we 
introduced an amendment that authorized what we now hope to be able to 
pay for, which is an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act, which 
passed 96 to 4. Now we need to fund the program, and there is just one 
issue standing in the way.
  During committee consideration of the Endless Frontier Act, an 
amendment was adopted that would apply controversial Davis-Bacon 
language to the underlying CHIPS for America provision signed into law 
last year. This provision creates, I believe, an unnecessary 
distraction from our focus, which should be on defeating this 
vulnerability in the supply chain.
  The fact is, current wages of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing 
companies don&#x27;t need Davis-Bacon. They pay much better than the 
prevailing wage Davis-Bacon would require. So it is really a nonissue 
when it comes to semiconductor manufacturing.
  But what is more significant--and I think the reason why some of our 
Democratic friends are insisting on this inclusion--is it represents an 
expansion over labor policies by applying it to private construction as 
opposed to public works. Obviously, this would set a troublesome 
precedent.
  Leaving this language in the bill, I do believe, has the potential to 
weaken the support for the broader legislation. And I hope we can all 
agree that the stakes are too high to risk letting that happen.
  Last week, I introduced an amendment to strike this unnecessary and 
divisive provision and maintain strong bipartisan support for the 
underlying CHIPS for America legislation. A partisan provision with 
zero impact is hardly a reason to sacrifice the strong bipartisan 
support we have seen for the CHIPS Act.
  Republicans and Democrats have worked very closely together and, I 
think, really in an encouraging and responsible way to bolster domestic 
manufacturing of semiconductors and confront one of the biggest looming 
threats to our national security and our economic security. Now is not 
the time to backpedal on the progress we have made.
  I expect the Senate will vote on my amendment later this evening. I 
encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this 
amendment so we can maintain the strong bipartisan support we have 
demonstrated so far for this critical, critical legislation.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.
  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to follow my colleague from Texas 
to talk about the very issue that he brought up, which is where is 
America going with semiconductor manufacturing, design, and 
development.
  On this last point, I am pretty sure we see things differently. I am 
pretty sure that the majority--probably all of the Democrats would be 
enthusiastic about supporting both manufacturing in the United States 
as well as making sure that if Federal dollars are used, prevailing 
wage should be applied. I am sure we will differ on that point.
  But I think that we are, at least on our side of the aisle, 
supportive of this concept that chip fabrication, chip manufacturing in 
the United States of America is an important sector and that we are 
facing a chip shortage and that we should do something about it.
  If you think about it, semiconductors are like the oil of the 21st 
century. They have become an essential aspect. They can be found in 
children&#x27;s toys, in appliances, computers, cell phones, our 
telecommunications networks, and advanced national security technology, 
as my colleague was mentioning. They enable healthcare, artificial 
intelligence applications, financial services, and certainly in the 
area of defense.
  They have transformed how we communicate, how we learn, how we 
socialize. Yet they are so complex and manufacturing so expensive, it 
can cost anywhere from $5 to almost $20 billion--$20

[[Page S3847]]

billion is one number I have heard--just to build these facilities. 
This is why this issue has become so important.
  The United States has had strong leadership in the semiconductor 
area, but massive investments from other nations put us at a 
disadvantage when it comes to manufacturing. They are subsidizing and 
getting tax benefits up to 40 percent to build in Korea than in the 
United States of America. The Endless Frontier Act tries to address 
that because it really is a national security and telecommunications 
policy
  In the 1990s, the United States produced over 37 percent of the 
global chips supply. As you know, here in the United States, we have 48 
percent of the world&#x27;s aircraft production, but now with these 
challenges, as we look at the chip supply, they are down to 12 percent.
  I noticed in the Wall Street Journal they said: Why do we care? Why 
do we care? They basically are saying that chips in fabrication have 
become a commodity and that we don&#x27;t have to worry about it anymore. As 
long as we are winning on the design side, we don&#x27;t care where it is 
manufactured.
  Well, if you ask me, that is so 1980s--I mean, the idea that you 
could design a product here and then have it manufactured somewhere 
else. Maybe that works with shoes or outdoor clothing, but it doesn&#x27;t 
work with something as sophisticated and changing as a high-tech 
innovation product like semiconductors. In fact, I would say, if you 
really think that type of thinking works, just look at what happened. 
It is really pro-COVID thinking. We thought we could have the design 
done here and, basically, some of these devices that we use here, like 
ventilators, we will just produce them overseas. What could possibly go 
wrong? Well, we figured out what could go wrong. If we are not 
manufacturing ventilators here in the United States, something could go 
wrong, and it did.
  The question is, What is going to go wrong if we don&#x27;t manufacture 
chips in the United States of America? The thing I don&#x27;t think that the 
Wall Street Journal quite got right is that they don&#x27;t understand that 
in today&#x27;s innovation cycle, having a cluster of design, of 
manufacturing, of supply chain, of customers--everybody working 
together is the new way to have an economic advantage.
  In fact, there is a recent study done by a Chicago research 
organization. I am going to read from this report. Basically, it is all 
about clusters and why clusters are so important:

       An industry cluster is a group of firms, related 
     stakeholders, and supportive institutions that gain 
     productive advantages from close geographic proximity and 
     related economies of scale. As groups of related industries 
     grow and develop, clustering can help lower business costs 
     and increase the extent of benefits of specialization. Deeper 
     labor pools, better access to customers and suppliers, 
     knowledge spillover--these and other advantages are derived 
     from an environment of balanced competition and 
     collaboration.

  I could go on. I will submit it for the Record. That is what is 
happening with semiconductors.
  The Asian market has, basically, now become the epicenter for this 
level of production, and the question is, Are we just going to forgo 
that and end up, basically, with not 12 percent of market share here 
but 6 percent of market share? Then our suppliers are going to continue 
to go where the investments and the energy and the ideas are.
  That is why in the United States of America, where we still have 
clusters in various parts of the United States--my colleague from Texas 
knows this well because he has a cluster in Texas. My colleague from 
Oregon, who was out here earlier, knows because they have a cluster 
there. There are clusters in places like Arizona. This is about whether 
the United States of America is going to continue to make this 
investment ourselves.
  Chips are essential to our national security and to 
telecommunications. In 1990, we produced over 37 percent of global chip 
supply, and we need to continue to make sure that we are going to be an 
investor in chip fabrication today.
  Today, as I said, we are at an inflection point because of what is 
happening in a global basis. According to Goldman Sachs, 169 industries 
in the United States have products with embedded semiconductors, and 
there will be a 20-percent shortfall of components needed for those 
products.
  Last month, Caterpillar, headquartered in Illinois, said it 
anticipated the chip shortage impairing its ability to meet growing 
demand of construction and mining equipment. We are not just talking 
about kids&#x27; gaming consoles or computers. We are talking about many 
sectors of our economy that depend on this.
  National security experts argue that if there were a greater trade 
war or military conflict, the United States would not be able to fill 
its demand for chips for national security and critical infrastructure 
needs.
  That means people like car manufacturers, appliance manufacturers--if 
you think about 5G and new technology--the post-pandemic economy won&#x27;t 
be able to keep moving forward.
  The shortage also forced the auto sector to cut 27,000 jobs in April 
alone. Earlier this year, General Motors temporarily shut down three 
North American plants due to the shortage. Ford cut back Michigan 
production of F-150s and the popular Explorer. And Dodge is reducing 
worker schedules in a Nevada plant producing the Jeep Grand Cherokee 
and Dodge Durango. These are having real-life impacts on us today.
  The question is, We had a ripple of this just because of COVID. What 
if we had a ripple of this because somebody decided not to supply 
things to us? These are things we have to worry about just in a 
national security perspective. You have to worry about whether we are 
going to get a supply chain that we can depend on. We really are at an 
inflection point. We are at an inflection point where we need to do 
something about this sector.
  One of the issues also is that chip fabrication and private R&D make 
huge investments. What we are talking about here represents a very 
small R&D investment partnership with the private sector as it relates 
to this. We are talking about trying to get more manufacturing jobs 
here in the United States.
  My colleague was just discussing this sector, overall, and one of the 
things that people should think about--and I am pretty sure people at 
home won&#x27;t be able to see this--but these jobs in production and in 
various aspects of design and even on some of the other aspects, even 
in management and computer, these are all well-paying jobs. These are 
jobs that, literally, are the types of jobs we want to be producing in 
the United States.
  I heard this story about Idaho. Micron, a big company that used to be 
a major chip fabrication--they are still doing chip fabrication--but 
the number of jobs in Boise, ID, has fallen off, probably in the 
thousands, because this production has gone to other places. Now we are 
replacing them with call center jobs.
  The question is whether we are going to make this investment in a key 
technology critical to our national security--critical to a lot of 
applications of the technology future, whether it is 5G or AI or 
various things--and whether we are going to be a competitor in this 
area of a supply chain and cluster that continues to innovate.
  We know for a fact that semiconductor jobs in the production area are 
literally $94,000 a year. That is why we are fighting for this because 
it is a sector, in just the production end, that is high-paying jobs.
  So are we going to spend time letting things go overseas and 
basically saying, ``OK, they will allow us to have call centers,&#x27;&#x27; or 
are we going to fight for these high-paying jobs in the semiconductor 
space that we know will help us maintain our expertise and skill in the 
United States?
  I ask my colleagues to just think about the fact that this notion 
that we design something here and ship it overseas for cheap production 
does not fit this bill. That is not what we need to do to maintain 
competitiveness, in the information age, on something as important as 
semiconductors.
  I think our history is rich with people like Thomas Edison and the 
Edison Park, which is what we established in New Jersey, or Menlo Park, 
or what now exists in Seattle or in various places. People get that 
innovation happens in clusters. So, if we are going to innovate, we 
have to make sure the United States is attracting this investment. We 
have to make sure that we are doing this here, on our shores, with the 
expertise and support.

[[Page S3848]]

  A lot of my colleagues might say: Well, do you know what? Let&#x27;s just 
have the private sector do this R&D.
  As I said, the private sector spends a lot on R&D. In fact, we think 
the private sector spends about $377 billion a year on R&D. Yet, as we 
know, R&D isn&#x27;t just done by the private sector for its specific 
interest. Basic science and lots of advanced research and applied 
science are done by the United States. That is why this bill is 
plussing up this number here from the National Science Foundation. We 
had discussions here about plussing up the number from the Department 
of Energy. Obviously, we had a vote in the Senate of even increasing 
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and its dollars.
  What works about the United States of America is that we are an 
ecosystem. We are not a top-down. It is not like we are basically the 
government, saying: This is what is going to be done. We create an 
ecosystem that is really based on American know-how--our ingenuity in 
how to get things done.
  What we are asking for, as it relates to not only NSF funding in 
order to continue the work of R&D as it relates to semiconductors, is 
also to make sure that we are going to continue the focus of 
manufacturing and design and R&D and development and clustering and 
supply chain and companies working together.
  I know how important this is because, in the Seattle area, in 
Washington State, we are a leader in aerospace technology. We are 49 
percent, in the United States, of aerospace manufacturing. If you don&#x27;t 
keep manufacturing, do you think the supply chain will stay in Seattle? 
Do you think the supply chain would stay in Seattle forever--all of 
those companies? We have hundreds of companies that make products for 
Boeing. Do you think they would stay there if it were not there? They 
will end up moving where the manufacturing is.
  That is what the information age is about, and it is certainly about 
that when it comes to technology products. The technology products are 
developed faster, quicker, and with the innovation and the input from 
their customers. That is why, if you look at these centers around the 
United States, they are also the places at which you will find the 
biggest users of this technology. They are there, and they are there 
because they want to be close to their customers. They want to 
understand their customers&#x27; needs. They want to have interaction. They 
want to have collaboration.
  That is what innovation is today. Innovation is doing design and 
manufacturing close together. That is how we win. That is why we need 
to pass this legislation as it relates to an investment in chip design 
and manufacturing R&D and so we continue to attract manufacturing in 
the United States.
  Back to my colleague from Texas, who I know agrees with this 
principle in an underlying way, when the Federal Government wants to 
make an investment in actual construction, we say that we should apply 
prevailing wage. I have talked to many of these people in the 
semiconductor manufacturing-design space. They say: Do you see how 
expensive it is to do these plans? Do you see how expensive the 
equipment is? It is very expensive; so we need the best workforce. So 
guess what. We pay prevailing wage.
  So we are saying, because we are putting Federal dollars on the 
table, we should pay prevailing wage. They think we should also pay 
prevailing wage. I am not speaking for them, but, in general, they feel 
like that is when they get their best product.
  I know where my side of the aisle is. We are going to be here to make 
an investment in this particular sector. We are going to figure out how 
to be competitive against Asia in semiconductor manufacturing. We are 
going to continue, as Andy Grove said, to be paranoid because we know 
that this is a changing landscape, and we are going to follow our 
colleagues who have made these decisions and make an investment for the 
future.
  I ask our colleagues to turn down the motion to strike the underlying 
bill, as the underlying bill already has this provision in it, and 
let&#x27;s get about this business of waiving a budget point of order and 
deciding to make the investment that we need to make to be competitive 
in a key sector of the U.S. economy. If we do that, I guarantee you we 
will be well-positioned to continue to move forward, and our national 
security will be more secure because we will have made this decision.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). The Senator from North Dakota


                      Military Appreciation Month

  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to mark Military Appreciation Month 
and to pay tribute to the many military members and veterans who have 
sacrificed in service to our Nation.
  This month provides an opportunity to show our immense gratitude to 
all those who have donned a uniform in our Armed Forces. The freedoms 
and blessings we enjoy as a nation have been secured by their hard work 
and determination. Military Appreciation Month culminates in Memorial 
Day--the date set aside to honor the men and women who have given the 
ultimate sacrifice in defense of our Nation.
  While we honor their memory on Memorial Day, we remember their loss 
every day and extend our gratitude to their loved ones, as well as to 
those who continue to serve.
  We also recognize that those who serve do not serve alone. The 
friends and families of those in the service of our country also serve, 
and those who have lost loved ones know too well the cost of our 
freedoms. I believe that we best honor and pay tribute to our military 
members by thanking them, both past and present, and by ensuring they 
have the resources and support they have so richly earned.
  As a member of the Senate Defense and Veterans&#x27; Affairs 
Appropriations Subcommittees, I have worked with my colleagues to 
ensure that our veterans and military members are properly trained and 
equipped and receive the care, benefits, and recognition they were 
promised. Our servicemembers and their families have given much in 
defense of our Nation, and the State of North Dakota, especially, has a 
rich tradition of military service.
  My State is home to some of the country&#x27;s most premier Air Force 
installations, including the Minot and Grand Forks Air Force Bases and 
Cavalier Air Station. We have more than 7,300 Active-Duty 
servicemembers who are currently serving in North Dakota and performing 
missions that are essential to our national security. In addition, more 
than 4,400 men and women serve in the North Dakota National Guard. 
Currently, more than 53,000 veterans call North Dakota home.
  We are grateful for the many servicemembers and veterans who have 
served our country, and we honor their service every day but especially 
during Military Appreciation Month. We will never forget the sacrifices 
of those who gave their lives so we can enjoy the freedoms that we are 
so blessed to have today and every day


                   Tribute to Lynn Aas and John Sinn

  Mr. President, there is no better example of service and sacrifice 
than that of our ``greatest generation.&#x27;&#x27; I would like to honor two 
World War II veterans, as well as the Kiwanis Club of Minot, ND, of 
which they have both been lifelong members. This year marks the 100th 
anniversary of the Minot Kiwanis Club, as well as the 100-year 
birthdays of two Kiwanis members, Mr. Lynn Aas and Mr. John Sinn.
  Since its founding on May 27, 1921, the Kiwanis Club of Minot has 
helped to make my home town, where I grew up, a better place to live. 
As a former member myself of this organization, I deeply appreciate its 
continued dedication and contributions to the community and the 
surrounding area. Some examples of its work include donating books to 
schools, supporting the arts, and raising money for local service 
organizations like the Boy Scouts, the Juvenile Drug Court, and the 
Domestic Violence Crisis Center. In these ways, Minot&#x27;s local Kiwanis 
chapter helps realize the mission of this international organization 
and makes a real difference to families and children in the region.
  For two individuals who have been lifelong members of that group, in 
the very same year the organization turns 100, it is their 100th 
birthdays as well. As part of the ``greatest generation&#x27;&#x27; and as World 
War II veterans, Lynn Aas and John Sinn have both been important parts 
of the Minot community in so many ways and have set a great example not 
only in their service but

[[Page S3849]]

in the service they have delivered throughout their lives even after 
World War II.
  A native of McLean County, ND, Lynn Aas fought as a rifleman in the 
historic Battle of the Bulge. He served with the 17th Airborne Division 
of the 193rd Airborne Infantry and received the Bronze Star, the Purple 
Heart, and the French Legion of Honour medal. Following the war, he 
returned to his home State, where he earned his law degree from the 
University of North Dakota.
  In addition to being a lifelong Kiwanis member, he served in our 
State&#x27;s legislature for four sessions. He was the president of the 
Minot Chamber of Commerce; served on the board for the United Way; and 
has been a longtime supporter of Minot State University and of so many, 
many other worthwhile things. His family and my family have been 
friends for as long as I can remember--truly, a great American.
  Also, John Sinn--another veteran of World War II--has his 100th 
birthday as well. As a member of the 386th Infantry Regiment, John Sinn 
served in the European theater, where he earned the Bronze Star. He 
returned home to farm with family members in Ryder, ND, eventually 
going to work for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1957.
  He retired in 1989, more than 30 years ago. However, rather than 
taking a well-earned rest, he has continued to serve the community as a 
volunteer. Included among his volunteer efforts, he is best known for 
his work to improve and maintain the Scandinavian Heritage Park--a 
beautiful Scandinavian park in the community. It is truly an iconic 
outdoor museum. It is central to the community&#x27;s identity and is home 
to the annual Norsk Hostfest, the largest celebration of Scandinavian 
culture and history in North America.
  The Presiding Officer is invited any time he would like to come join 
us. It is a wonderful festival with wonderful food, and the best view 
of the park can be found at John Sinn Outlook, which is a testament to 
his many contributions.
  We recognize the hard work, dedication, and service of Lynn Aas, John 
Sinn, and the entire Minot Kiwanis Club as they celebrate their 100th 
birthdays this year. It is therefore appropriate to take this time to 
recognize their hard work, their dedication, and their service, and I 
have submitted a statement honoring that today.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.


                                S. 1260

  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I am thrilled that we are passing this 
legislation. It is amazing to me--and I am sure the Presiding Officer 
would agree--that the Senate has actually returned to regular order. We 
are passing amendments on both sides of the aisle, and I think we are 
going to have a big bipartisan vote here in the Senate. In having been 
here for a number of years when the Senate didn&#x27;t operate that way--it 
was incredibly dysfunctional--it is a great, great privilege to be here 
at a moment when it is working. So I want to express my sense of 
gratitude for that.


                          January 6 Commission

  Mr. President, I also want to call the Presiding Officer&#x27;s attention 
to news reports this afternoon that say that our colleagues on the 
Republican side of the aisle have decided they are going to block this 
bipartisan Commission to examine what happened on January 6 and that 
they are going to use the filibuster here to block a Commission that 
some of them actually called for and a Commission that, I think, 35 
Republican Members of the House of Representatives supported.
  I wanted to come to the floor to appeal to their conscience and to 
ask them to consider the damage that it will do to our democracy to not 
have this Commission, as we have done at other important moments in the 
country&#x27;s history.
  And, Mr. President, you were here on January 6. I was here on January 
6. We had been sent here--we came here--to accomplish the ministerial 
task that we are required after a Presidential election is concluded, 
to certify the results of that election, to certify the ballots of 
millions and millions and millions of Americans who voted in the last 
election. That is why we were here.
  Unfortunately, we had a President at that time who denied that the 
election had actually happened.
  The President will remember that we also had colleagues that came to 
this floor and said that we were disrespecting the President&#x27;s base or 
their base because we were certifying the election, instead of having 
enough respect for their base to tell them the truth, which was that 
the election had been decided by millions of voters, and by every court 
that looked at it and by incredibly brave local officials, many of them 
Republicans, who wouldn&#x27;t allow the President to push them around.
  The 6th was a terrible day here. The people who invaded this Capitol, 
the people who stormed the platform that had been set up for the 
peaceful transfer of power on January 20, when Joe Biden took the oath 
of office--the people who came here on January 6 cursed the Capitol 
Police. They bludgeoned the Capitol Police. They speared them. They 
hurled racial epithets, leading some of our African-American police 
officers here to ask what had happened to America. They broke windows 
in the Capitol. They looted the Parliamentarian&#x27;s office--the people 
who would bravely carry the ballots out of this Chamber, when we were 
led to the Hart building, and protect those ballots that could have 
ended up getting burned out on the National Mall, if they hadn&#x27;t had 
the presence of mind to do their job--just like the Capitol Police, who 
were in mortal danger that day doing their job.
  And I remember, when we were all together in one of the Senate office 
buildings, after they had rushed us out of here, we would later see 
that the mob was just a hallway away from here, and, actually, they 
were misdirected by another Capitol Police officer, who put his life in 
jeopardy to move them out of the way.
  We were taken to another building, a Senate office building, and it 
was in that room--we were crowded in that room. It was in that room 
that I saw a scene that I never thought I would ever see as an 
American, on the TV sets that were on the walls of that room. While we 
were inside the room, we were watching the scene that everyone else in 
the country and everyone else across the world was watching of the U.S. 
Capitol being invaded by our own people.
  I know the President will remember that when he was growing up, when 
I was growing up, that was not an uncommon sight to see in countries 
all over the world. There are a lot of countries that have had events 
like January 6 over the world, especially when there have been 
transitions of power or a tyrant unwilling to give up their power.
  But in a million years, I would never have imagined that it would 
happen here. And it did happen, and it sent a message all over the 
planet.
  While we were in that room, unable to certify this election, the 
Chinese Government had the greatest propaganda win that you could 
imagine, and in the weeks that followed, they have said democracy is in 
decline, democracy is failing. That is what the Russians are saying. 
That is what the Iranians are saying.
  And when I was there in that room that day, I thought a lot about my 
mom and her parents, who were Polish Jews, who survived the Holocaust. 
The whole family was killed except for them and an aunt, and they were 
lucky enough that, after the war was over, they went to Stockholm, 
Sweden, for a year. They went to Mexico City for a year, and then they 
came here to the only country in the world where they thought they 
could rebuild their shattered lives. And they did.
  And so even worse for me than the thought of our adversaries using 
this to undermine democracy was the understanding that people all over 
the world situated just like my mom and her parents would lose hope in 
the American ideal, would lose hope in democracy and in the rule of 
law.
  Now, the good news is we actually had a January 20. A lot of 
countries that go through January 6 never get to January 20, and we had 
that, and Joe Biden took the oath of office and he became President of 
the United States, and Kamala Harris became the Vice President of the 
United States. We had, notwithstanding all of the prior President&#x27;s 
efforts to the contrary and the efforts of some of his allies in 
Congress

[[Page S3850]]

to the contrary--we had--a peaceful transfer of power.
  But consider how close we came, not just on the 6th, but consider 
what would have happened if elected officials, many of them Republicans 
in Georgia and in Arizona and in Michigan hadn&#x27;t fulfilled their 
obligations to the rule of law, hadn&#x27;t lived up to their oath of 
office, bent to the will of a President who didn&#x27;t want to relinquish 
power. Where would we be then?
  Imagine if the Democrats, instead of winning a narrow majority in the 
House of Representatives, had lost the majority in the House of 
Representatives, and 140 or more--148--Republican votes to decertify 
the election, to overturn the will of the voters, to disenfranchise 
millions and millions and millions of Americans all of a sudden was a 
majority doing that, as the former President would have wanted.
  Imagine if 60 judges, many of them Republicans, appointed by 
President Trump, who howled the President&#x27;s lawyers out of courtroom 
after courtroom, after courtroom because, instead of doing what the 
President wanted them to do, instead of finding them ``a few more 
votes,&#x27;&#x27; as he said to the secretary of state in Georgia, recorded on 
the phone, they did their job as judges and they withstood the 
pressure. They swore an oath, and they fulfilled their oath, and that 
is the only way democracy can actually work. It is when elected 
officials and judicial officials apply the rule of law, fulfill their 
oath and their obligation.

  And what I want to say to my colleagues today, I want to implore them 
and appeal to their conscience, because the responsibility to the 
democracy is not over. The democracy is still at risk. We still have a 
President of the United States--a former President--who refuses to 
concede the election, who, on a daily basis almost, says that the 
election was stolen. We still have Members of Congress who are saying 
the election was stolen. We still have Members of Congress who won&#x27;t 
face the facts and tell their constituents the truth.
  I want to say again: Respect your constituents enough that you are 
going to tell them the truth, and that is why, at difficult moments in 
our history, like after President Kennedy was killed or the Challenger 
exploded or 9/11 happened, we have had a bipartisan Commission to make 
sure we understood what led us here and how we can do better coming out 
of this.
  It has never been perfect, but it has worked pretty well, and that is 
what we need here. We need to understand what led millions of Americans 
to believe conspiracy theories about our own country and what led 
thousands of people to storm the Capitol of the United States, to 
attack police officers, to attack police officers, leading to their 
death.
  From all over the country, they came to invade this Capitol, and if 
we don&#x27;t want it to happen again or we want to be able to protect 
ourselves, and I am not just talking about the poor Capitol Police, 
although that, at a bare minimum, ought to be enough to warrant a 
Commission. I am talking about the danger of political violence in this 
Nation going forward if we don&#x27;t address this and the American people 
don&#x27;t have the chance to understand what happened.
  As I mentioned, that night on January 6, standing at this desk on the 
floor, political violence is what brings these republics to an end.
  I am going to finish because I know there are others who want to 
speak, but let me just finish by saying how agonizing it was to watch 
Officer Sicknick&#x27;s mom here today, going door to door to door, to ask 
people: Please vote for this Commission.
  I hope that people will reconsider. I hope they will search their 
conscience. The people around the world who watched January 6 are 
watching us today, and they want to know if democracy is up to the 
challenges of the 21st century.
  I believe it is. I believe it is. I think democracy is the highest 
expression of humanity on Earth, and we are being tested in all kinds 
of ways right now, externally and internally. This would give us the 
chance to at least deal with the internal question. And I think at a 
moment like this it is important for us not to stand for a party or for 
a President but for the truth and for common sense and for our exercise 
in self-government.
  For all of those reasons, I hope that when we have the vote tonight, 
that it will succeed and the American people will have the benefit of a 
bipartisan Commission to examine what happened on January 6 and help us 
understand how we can strengthen our democracy.
  With that, I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.


         Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 478 and S. 789 En Bloc

  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, the Senate has a solemn duty to exercise 
and fulfill U.S. Federal trust responsibility. This duty is the guiding 
principle for all our work on behalf of American Indians, Alaska 
Natives, and Native Hawaiians. So as the chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Indian Affairs, it is my job to prioritize and push Tribal 
and Native communities&#x27; legislative priorities toward the finish line 
and ultimately to actually enact legislation.
  The Indian Affairs Committee has a strong tradition of bipartisanship 
going back decades. Committee Members on both sides of the aisle 
routinely work together to achieve their own Native communities&#x27; goals. 
When there are disagreements, we do everything we can to work them out 
internally and to find common ground so that Members aren&#x27;t forced to 
air their disagreements when bills get to the floor.
  In fact, just last night, the Senate passed eight Indian Affairs 
bills unanimously. Those bills would, among other things, promote 
economic development, protect Native children, honor Tribal self-
determination--goals that we all agreed take important steps toward 
fulfilling our shared Federal trust responsibilities. Time and again, 
we have shown that the Indian Affairs bills can rise above partisan 
logjams. That compromise can be found. But here we are.
  H.R. 478, which passed the House on May 12, 2021, under suspension of 
the rules, would help to rebuild Tribal homelands; and S. 789, which 
passed the Senate unanimously in late November 2019, would repeal 11 
obsolete, racist, unenforced laws that are inconsistent with the 
current government-to-government relationship enjoyed by the United 
States and Indian Tribes.
  Both bills would likely be laws by now if the COVID-19 pandemic had 
not disrupted our legislative work last year. These bills are good 
policy. That is why both Republican and Democratic administrations 
support them.
  And the Senate should have passed these bills last night, but because 
there was an objection to their inclusion in the 10-bill package, we 
find ourselves here again. The Indian Affairs Committee, as is 
tradition, has negotiated in good faith to clear up any concerns there 
may be, but those efforts were not successful, which leads me to this 
moment.
  When it comes to fulfilling the U.S. trust responsibility, there is 
no room for partisanship.
  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate 
consideration of the following bills en bloc: Calendar No. 59, H.R. 
478, the Blackwater Trading Post Land Transfer Act; and Calendar No. 
53, S. 789, the RESPECT Act; further, that the bills be considered read 
a third time and passed en bloc and the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the table en bloc, with no intervening 
action or debate.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  The Senator from Utah.
  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, one of the 
bills in question--specifically, H.R. 478, would direct the Secretary 
of the Interior to take 55.3 acres of land owned by the Gila River 
Indian Community into trust.
  The Gila River Indian Community Reservation is already 583 square 
miles, with a population of 11,000. The Gila River Indian Community 
already owns this land, so why we need to take more land into trust and 
have the Federal Government more involved in the management of the land 
is not immediately obvious or apparent to me. The answer is not at all 
clear as to why it needs to be in trust.
  Trust land responsibilities for the Federal Government are 
significant and before we expand the size of our trust lands, we have 
to have an understanding of what we are doing and the actual need to do 
it

[[Page S3851]]

  Proponents of this legislation have claimed that the Tribe has a 
unique history with this particular plot of land--this particular 55.3 
acres of land--adjacent to the trust land. But from the history shown, 
the Tribe&#x27;s interaction with the land is mostly that they have had 
friendly neighbors with whom they have traded goods.
  As many of my colleagues are aware, I have great concerns that I have 
quite consistently expressed with further expanding the Federal 
Government&#x27;s management or involvement in public lands, including trust 
lands.
  Nevertheless, I have been engaging in negotiations, and I have made a 
number of good-faith efforts to develop a possible path forward--one in 
which the amount of acreage owned or held in trust by the Federal 
Government would not grow, while taking this land into trust for the 
Gila River Indian Community. While I continue to negotiate a path 
forward, I am not inclined to abandon this concern. This is a 
negotiation that has been in progress.
  That said, with respect to the part of the request dealing 
specifically with S. 789, the RESPECT Act, I am willing to let that go. 
But if the request is to pass both of these by unanimous consent, I 
can&#x27;t support that, and on that basis, I object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.
  The Senator from Hawaii.
  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, a couple of points. On taking 55.3 acres 
into trust, this is not like the Federal Government is going to have 
new land management responsibilities. This is a matter of principle for 
the Senator from Utah, and I recognize that; that he thinks, basically, 
no additional land should be taken into trust, even though this 
government-to-government relationship--this authority over these 
government relationships are enshrined in the Constitution of the 
United States and this government-to-government relationship has 
already been established by statutory law and the process for putting 
land into trust is already a well-established pathway. But what the 
Senator from Utah is saying is no more or we are going to have to do a 
one-for-one swap or even sometimes a two-for-one swap. You cannot have 
a net increase in the acreage, even if it is 53 acres, even if there is 
an established process.
  And so, I do find that difficult to work with. I know that the 
Senators from Arizona are in discussions with the Senator from Utah.
  We will find our way forward. This is 53 acres. It is important, 
obviously. We are going to enact this legislation.
  I like the Senator from Utah. We will find a way on this one.
  But if he would entertain an amendment to the request, then I would 
be pleased to pass the RESPECT Act by voice vote, if that is something 
that the Senator from Utah would be amenable to.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.
  Mr. LEE. I fully am amenable to that, with the RESPECT Act
