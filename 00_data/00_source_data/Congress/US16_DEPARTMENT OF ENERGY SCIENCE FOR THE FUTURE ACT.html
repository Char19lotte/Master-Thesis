Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks 
and to include extraneous material on <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3593">H.R. 3593</a>, the bill now under 
consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  I am very pleased today that we are considering the Department of 
Energy Science for the Future Act.
  This well-vetted, bipartisan bill will provide the first ever 
comprehensive authorization for the Department of Energy&#x27;s Office of 
Science. This office accounts for over half of the Department&#x27;s 
nondefense research and development budget and supports a wide range of 
research facilities and activities that are critical to the U.S. 
competitiveness and for enabling our clean energy future.
  The Office of Science is the Nation&#x27;s largest supporter of research 
in the physical sciences, and it is the lead Federal agency supporting 
scientific research for energy applications. <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3593">H.R. 3593</a> authorizes 
significant, steady, and sustainable growth for the office&#x27;s wide-
ranging research from climate science to quantum science, and 
everything in between.
  The bill also ensures the office&#x27;s construction projects and upgrades 
to its world-class scientific user facility have the resources they 
need to be completed on time and on budget.
  <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3593">H.R. 3593</a> is a substantial effort in the fight against climate 
change. The bill authorizes research to advance the next generation of 
clean energy technologies to help us reach our shared goals of 
developing energy that is clean, sustainable, reliable, and affordable. 
In carrying out these activities, this bill also directs the office to 
support the development of a skilled, diverse, and inclusive workforce 
for clean energy researchers, scientists, and professionals.
  That is why the bill has been endorsed by stakeholders in the 
business community, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; the academic 
community, like the Association of American Universities; major 
scientific associations, like the American Physical and Chemical 
Societies; and significant environmental organizations like the 
Environmental Defense Fund.
  This bill is another strong example of the collaborative bipartisan 
approach that our committee has taken. Ranking Member Lucas&#x27; 
collaborative approach has been crucial in getting us to where we are 
today.
  Before I yield back, I would like to recognize the Committee on 
Science, Space, and Technology staff who worked on this bill, and in 
some cases for several years now: Adam Rosenberg, Alyse Huffman, 
Sangina Wright, and Bill Kallen. I also recognize the efforts of 
Ranking Member Lucas&#x27; staff in helping us to get where we are today, 
including Hillary O&#x27;Brien, Jenn Wickre, and Daniel Dziadon.
  I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support 
this bill to dramatically improve the Nation&#x27;s competitiveness and help 
lead us all to a brighter future. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.
  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise in support of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3593">H.R. 3593</a>, the Department of Energy Science for 
the Future Act. This legislation, along with <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a>, the NSF for the 
Future Act is a comprehensive and strategic approach for investing in 
American research and development.
  For decades, America has been the global leader in science and 
technology development. That success is no accident. It is the result 
of two things: A cultural commitment to innovation and exploration, and 
a sustained investment in basic research.
  This is what makes us uniquely successful. The Federal Government 
funds high-risk, high-reward basic research that expands our 
fundamental knowledge of science and technology. This research, which 
is too costly for the marketplace to fund, produces discoveries that 
can then be commercialized through private industry.
  Our system maximizes taxpayer investment and takes advantage of 
strong public-private partnerships to keep America at the cutting edge 
of technological progress.
  Unfortunately, our adversaries in China are investing more than us in 
R&D in an attempt to take over the lead in science and technology.
  The way to stay ahead of China isn&#x27;t adopting their method of a top-
down, government-mandated, applied research agenda. It is to reinvest 
in the basic research, infrastructure, and STEM workers that have 
always driven American progress.
  <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3593">H.R. 3593</a> does just that. It is the first comprehensive authorization 
of the Office of Science, which is our Nation&#x27;s largest Federal sponsor 
of basic research in the physical sciences. The DOE Science for the 
Future Act invests $50 billion over 5 years in the Office of Science 
and the national labs, national scientific user facilities, and the 
thousands of researchers its supports.
  The DOE Science for the Future Act is an investment in our 
technological and clean energy future. It funds research into 
materials, chemical, biological, and environmental sciences, as well as 
fusion energy, advanced computing capacities, and cutting edge 
technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum sciences.
  We already know that investments in basic research pay large 
dividends. For example, basic research conducted in our national labs 
gave us improved hydraulic fracturing technology and allowed us to 
produce more clean natural gas. This reduced emissions, lowered energy 
costs for Americans, and helped us become a net total energy exporter 
for the first time in decades.
  That is why everyone who cares about clean energy must care about the 
research supported by <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3593">H.R. 3593</a>. Investing in high-risk, early-stage 
research into cutting edge technologies is the only way to ensure that 
America stays at the head of the clean energy economy.

  Another important provision in the DOE Science for the Future Act is 
the creation of a crosscutting Emerging Infectious Disease Research 
Initiative to build on DOE&#x27;s work to better model, understand, and 
fight infectious diseases.
  As they have shown time and again during the COVID-19 pandemic, our 
national labs have an important role to play in supporting public 
health. This legislation gives them the resources they need to continue 
this work.
  <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3593">H.R. 3593</a> also funds much-needed infrastructure updates for our 
national labs and user facilities. Our ability to conduct world-leading 
science depends on having access to world-leading equipment and 
facilities.
  It also requires having skilled STEM professionals to conduct that 
research. Our bill includes workforce development and education 
provisions so that we have a thriving STEM pipeline to fill the 
technological jobs of the future.
  Mr. Speaker, <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3593">H.R. 3593</a> is a forward-looking bill that is badly needed 
right now to drive American progress and to keep us globally 
competitive.
  As with the NSF for the Future Act, this legislation was drafted with 
extensive input in a bipartisan fashion, and the result is a strategic 
and responsible investment in the next generation of breakthrough 
energy technologies.
  I thank my friend Chairwoman Johnson for all her work with me on this 
bill, and I urge my colleagues to pass this now. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may 
consume to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).
  Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding.

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H3219">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H3219">H3219</a></a>]]

  I rise today in support of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3593">H.R. 3593</a>, the Department of Energy 
Science for the Future Act. As a newly minted member of the Science, 
Space, and Technology Committee, I was so proud to see my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle work so hard on this bill to pass it through 
committee with amendments from both Democrats and Republicans. I, too, 
had an opportunity as a newly minted member to make an impact on this 
important legislation.
  And I think that it wasn&#x27;t by accident, and I thank the chairwoman of 
the committee, Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson and Representative 
Lucas, the ranking member, for creating the environment in which we 
could do our work and craft this important legislation.
  As you all have heard, the Department of Energy&#x27;s Office of Science 
is a hub of technological advancement and research designed to tackle 
our greatest scientific challenges facing the United States.
  Through several hearings in the committee, we learned about the DOE 
Office of Science&#x27;s ongoing efforts to support research and to find 
solutions.
  This bill allows the Office of Science to continue carrying out 
nondefense research on a vast array of critical areas. It supports 
research to modernize our energy infrastructure, allowing us the tools 
to overhaul our outdated energy grid to more climate-friendly 
solutions. And we, of course, have seen some of the catastrophic events 
caused by the lack of current technologies that recognize the climate 
action.
  It funds continuing studies in artificial intelligence and quantum 
computing, keeping pace with our competitors in the tech sector and 
readying our cybersecurity defenses from our adversaries, as we have 
seen up close and personal the cost to our country to not keep abreast 
of these technologies.
  During markup, I was able to offer a provision that was included in 
the bill that is before the House today that would prioritize clean 
water and watershed research at the Office of Science. My amendment 
directs the Office of Science to support clean water and watershed 
research that increases the quality and quantity of water across 
America, including the treasured Great Lakes.
  My home district of Milwaukee shares a coast with Lake Michigan, 
which I consider one of my most important constituents.
  It is imperative that we study the harmful effects of water 
pollution, make investments in technologies to combat the contamination 
of our waterways, and to protect drinking water sources that are 
critical to every man, woman, and child. We also need to make sure that 
water continues to be a resource for commerce.
  My amendment also ensures that relevant communities, research 
institutions, and nonprofits will be at the table when DOE carries out 
these tasks. Innovation doesn&#x27;t occur in a vacuum, and it is critical 
that these research efforts have real world input from key 
stakeholders.
  Before I close, I want to mention something about the National 
Science Foundation, <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2225">H.R. 2225</a>, which we considered on this floor today. 
I thank the chair and the ranking member for leaning in again to put 
this together in giving Members an opportunity to weigh in.
  As you all know, the NSF is the funder of more than 1,800 
institutions in the United States, and they provide tremendous 
resources, funding, and opportunities for STEM students. I have been 
able to weigh in to make sure that there is diversity and opportunity 
in STEM.
  I urge my colleagues to support <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3593">H.R. 3593</a>, the Department of Energy 
Science for the Future Act.

                              {time}  1745

  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. Weber), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Energy.
  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Lucas and the 
chairwoman of the full committee, Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson. With this 
bill, the two of them have perfectly demonstrated how a committee can 
actually function--even with occasional disagreements--to prioritize 
shared goals and produce truly great bipartisan products. They are to 
be congratulated.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3593">H.R. 3593</a>, the 
Department of Energy Science for the Future Act.
  After over a decade of budget requests, hearings, stakeholder input, 
and information-gathering, I say with a sigh of relief and a great deal 
of joy that the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology has a 
bipartisan and comprehensive Office of Science authorization.
  Although it has taken a little longer than I would have expected, it 
couldn&#x27;t come at a better time. America&#x27;s scientific enterprise has 
never faced a more serious threat from global competition than it does 
right now--today.
  Innovative science discoveries and advance technology development 
aren&#x27;t just aspirations; they are the actual key to our national 
security, as well as our economic prosperity. That is because 
innovation and technology are exactly what the Chinese Communist Party 
has prioritized in its goal to overtake the United States of America as 
a global leader in industries of the future.
  Mr. Speaker, if we want to maintain our key edge in technology areas, 
like quantum information science and artificial intelligence, and 
combat the threat of another country controlling the development of 
those cutting-edge technologies and standards, we must take action now.
  Mr. Speaker, the solution is really quite simple. We have to invest 
in American innovation. Just that simple. We must invest in our 
facilities and our research right here in the United States so that we 
can ensure the United States remains the global leader in science.
  How exactly we go about that might be the subject of some debate, but 
I fully believe that the bill that we have before us today is the best 
course of action.
  The Department of Energy&#x27;s Office of Science has time and time again 
demonstrated that basic science research is the most effective way to 
encourage development of those new technologies. And as the largest 
Federal sponsor of basic research in the physical sciences, with 
unparalleled research capabilities and infrastructure, the Office of 
Science and its national laboratories are uniquely equipped to help 
America compete.
  By authorizing cutting-edge research programs with a responsible, 
scalable funding increase and a strategic roadmap for DOE, federally 
funded discoveries made through the Office of Science will pave the way 
for both public and private American innovators to license technologies 
and to launch those startups.
  Mr. Speaker, in addition, the Office of Science research in materials 
and chemical science, biological and environmental research, and fusion 
energy will not only maintain our lead in science, but will also lay 
the foundation for the next generation of clean, secure, and exportable 
energy technologies. Don&#x27;t miss that: Clean, exportable, and secure 
technologies.
  Maximizing the Office of Science&#x27;s role in our Federal research 
enterprise is how we win. This great legislative body and the Federal 
Government as a whole cannot and will not duplicate a nonmarket economy 
by forcing mandates and regulations. Instead, we can arm our dynamic 
private sector with the tools necessary to commercialize sustainable, 
affordable, and scalable energy solutions. Again, don&#x27;t miss that.
  Through the DOE Science of the Future Act, we are prioritizing 
critical research areas and investing in the science and technology 
that will drive development of those technologies into the next 
generation. This will allow America&#x27;s economy to thrive while reducing 
global emissions and allowing market-based solutions to flourish. Don&#x27;t 
miss that.
  Robust and consistent support for the Office of Science is crucial to 
the success and security of the U.S. innovation ecosystem, U.S. energy 
independence, and U.S. security.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill does that in a clear, streamlined fashion. It 
is not bogged down by outside interests or unrelated provisions. We 
won&#x27;t just keep up with China and other foreign adversaries; we will 
outpace them and lead, just like the United States of America has 
always done.
  That is a good thing. That is a very good thing, by the way.

  Mr. Speaker, I take a moment to thank the many stakeholders who have 
worked so hard to get this critical legislation done right. Hats off to 
all of them.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. It is a great 
one. It is high time we had this one on the floor.
  Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, America&#x27;s scientific and technological leadership is 
being threatened by the Chinese Communist Party, and we must act 
urgently to reinvest in our own research and development enterprise.
  <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3593">H.R. 3593</a> redoubles our commitment to the basic research conducted by 
the Department of Energy&#x27;s Office of Science and our national 
laboratories. Together with the NSF for the Future Act, it is a 
comprehensive and sustainable approach to American competitiveness.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank my staff for everything they have done to help 
draft this important legislation. I thank my friend, Chairwoman 
Johnson, and her staff for working with us to include Republican 
priorities and ensure that this is a truly bipartisan bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me simply say that we on this committee 
know that we are the committee that will determine the future of our 
Nation and the standing of the world when it comes to science. And we 
have taken our work very seriously. I am grateful to all of the 
members. We know we cannot be any better than the people who we involve 
and use their talents, and we must do that as well.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank all of the members of the committee on both 
sides of the aisle for staying with us and working through all that we 
know we need to do to come together to look out for the future of our 
Nation&#x27;s scientific enterprise.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask all of the persons, my colleagues, to support this 
bill and vote ``yes.&#x27;&#x27;
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Johnson) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3593">H.R. 3593</a>, as amended.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/8">House Resolution 
8</a>, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion 
are postponed.
