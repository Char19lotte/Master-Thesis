      "Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R . 4350 . The SPEAKER pro tempore . Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Washington ? There was no objection . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield myself 4 minutes . Madam Speaker , we have before us the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 , and I highly recommend it to the Members of the House and urge everybody to support this incredibly important and very well put together piece of legislation . [ [ Page H4794 ] ] The first thing I will say is thank you to all of the staff , certainly on the Armed Services Committee , but the Rules Committee as well , and the leadership staff . This has been a truly bipartisan legislative process . We had our markup in committee which lasted , I will do a little quick math in my head , something like 16 hours . We considered over 800 amendments , with a variety of different variations , and we got that number up closer to 1100 . And then before the Rules Committee there were , again , over 800 amendments submitted , and we have worked with Members of this body , Democrats and Republicans , members on the committee and off , to craft what I think is a very good piece of legislation . I think it is incredibly important , first of all , that we pass this bill so that Congress continues to exercise its authority to exercise oversight over the Department of Defense . I know Members on both sides of this aisle have lamented throughout the years the degree to which the executive branch has exerted more power over the years , where the legislative branch has exhibited less . Now , granted , you find that issue more troubling when the opposite party is in charge of the White House , but we are all troubled by that phenomena . We need to exercise our authority ; this bill does that . To my mind , Congress does not pass enough authorizing bills , but we do do so in the Department of Defense , and have done so for over 60 straight years , and should do so again . This bill , I think , is particularly important because we are at an important moment in defense of this country and in dealing with our role in the world . We have never faced a more complex threat environment . We have threats from Russia , China , Iran , North Korea , and transnational terrorist groups . In addition , we are now coming out of 20 years of war fought in Iraq and Afghanistan , both countries of which our military now is out and not fighting those wars , and we have a whole bunch of change to deal with . At the same time , innovation has never been more important in properly defending this country . We need to update and modernize our armed forces , everything from our information systems , to our command and control , to our platforms , to the support we give to our servicemembers . I am very proud that this bill reflects those priorities . And the work has been done between Mr. Rogers and myself and members of the committee to produce that product . And I want to take a moment here to thank Mr. Rogers , the ranking member , he has been a terrific partner in this process , as has his staff and as has his members . I think this bill reflects those priorities . It figures out how to improve our ability to update the military more quickly , to better buy software , to better innovate , to better embrace the innovative technologies that we need . Madam Speaker , I want to particularly thank Mr. Langevin , as the subcommittee chair , who has taken the lead on the AI task force that looks at this question in great specificity . This bill really puts us in a position to modernize the force as we need to . One other crucial issue that we do in this is we address the issue of sexual assault in the military that continues to be a scourge upon service in the military . We have worked for years to try to address this issue , we have not been successful . This year , thanks in large part to the leadership of Congresswoman Speier , we have updated the UCMJ to create a special victims ' prosecutor to give sexual assault and sex crimes the attention they deserve to make sure that we are protecting the men and women who serve in the military . It is a crucial aspect of this bill , and I strongly urge Members to support it . Lastly , let me just say that as you pore over this bill , everybody here will find something that they do not like . Everybody here will also find something that they wish was in there that is not . There is no doubt about that , because it is a very large bill , and it was a collaborative process . But it is the nature of the legislative process that you do n't get absolutely everything that you want . I hope Members will keep that in mind . But it is also the nature of the legislative process , in this case , that we have produced a product that everybody in this House can be proud of . And , again , I want to thank my Republican counterpart . We have worked together to produce this . I urge support from all Members . This is a bill every Member , Democrat and Republican , can enthusiastically support , and I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . Madam Speaker , I , too , rise in strong support of H.R . 4350 , the fiscal year National Defense Authorization Act . H.R . 4350 represents a truly bipartisan bill , and I want to thank Chairman Smith for his tremendous leadership and cooperation in helping fashion it . This has been a truly bipartisan endeavor . { time } 2115 Over the last few months , we have seen the best of our soldiers , sailors , airmen , marines , and guardians . They have performed in the toughest of environments with the greatest level of skill and professionalism . Many gave their lives so others would have a chance for a better life . Without a doubt , our military is the greatest force the world has ever seen . Providing the authorities and resources for our service that our servicemembers need to defend our Nation and defeat our adversaries is the greatest responsibility we have here in Congress . We accomplished that responsibility with the bill before us today . H.R . 4350 ensures our warfighters are the best equipped and trained in the world . The bill puts our servicemembers first , providing a 2.7 percent pay increase and expanding benefits for their families . It also puts American workers first with historic investments in our defense industrial base . It also begins divesting legacy systems that will not help us deter future threats . Instead , it invests in new technologies like AI , hypersonics , and quantum computing that will help us stay ahead of our adversaries . That is important because Russia and China are rapidly modernizing their militaries . China is outpacing us with advancements in emerging technologies and weapons systems , and we know China is n't building these capabilities purely for defense . In recent years , we have seen China use its military to push out its borders , threaten our allies , and gain footholds on new continents . H.R . 4350 is laser-focused on preparing our military to prevail in a conflict with China . It makes critical investments in new systems capable of surviving in a contested environment . It includes provisions that will remove China from our defense supply chain , and it reaffirms our support to allies in the region , especially Taiwan . Unfortunately , threats from near peer adversaries like China and Russia are not the only ones we face . Terrorists continue their plots to destroy our way of life , and we must continue to take the fight to them anywhere and anytime they threaten us . With strong investments in new capabilities and readiness , this bill enables our warfighters to do just that . Finally , regardless of how you feel about the war in Afghanistan , Madam Speaker , I think we are all horrified by its disastrous withdrawal . This bill includes over 20 provisions to provide accountability to get us answers to questions we have been asking for here for months . This is a strong , bipartisan bill that will enhance our oversight of the DOD and ensure our military is properly resourced and equipped to defend our Nation and our allies . Madam Speaker , I urge all Members to support the bill , and I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island ( Mr. Langevin ) . Mr. LANGEVIN . Madam Speaker , I thank the chairman for yielding . Madam Speaker , I rise in strong support of the National Defense Authorization Act . I commend Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers [ [ Page H4799 ] ] for their bipartisan cooperation in bringing the bill to the floor . I also want to thank Ranking Member Banks and former Ranking Member Stefanik for their bipartisan collaboration this year . I would also like to thank the members of the Cyber , Innovative Technologies , and Information Systems Subcommittee for their hard work , particularly Vice Chair Houlahan . Thanks to the work of my subcommittee , this legislation harnesses cutting-edge technology to benefit our warfighters and our national security . This legislation includes a 36 percent increase in defense- wide basic and applied research and development and significant increases for historically Black colleges and universities . This bill also includes many provisions recommended by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence , which I offered as a package of amendments during our committee markup . We are taking important steps in addressing the promises and challenges of this powerful technology , and I am thankful for the commission cochairs , Secretary Bob Work and Dr. Eric Schmidt , and members of that committee as well for their service . The NDAA builds off the important work of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission by establishing the Joint Collaborative Environment at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency , called CISA . This program , which will live at the newly established Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative , or JCDC , will facilitate public-private cooperation in analyzing cyber threats . Beyond the CITI provisions , the NDAA fully funds the Virginia-class and Columbia-class submarine programs which are crucial to our deterrence posture against China . I am so proud to represent the Rhode Islanders who construct these amazing vessels and do their part in keeping us safe . I am also proud of the reforms we made to the Uniform Code of Military Justice to address sexual assault and extremism and of our efforts to defend our military infrastructure against climate change . These achievements would not be possible , of course , without the work of my subcommittee staff : staff lead Michael Hermann ; Bess Dopkeen , Troy Nienberg , and Josh Stiefel . The SPEAKER pro tempore . The time of the gentleman has expired . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield the gentleman from Rhode Island an additional 30 seconds . Mr. LANGEVIN . I also thank minority staff , Sarah Moxley . Our clerk , Caroline Kehrli , is departing the subcommittee , and her work has been incredibly invaluable . My legislative director , Caroline Goodson , and military fellow , Juliann Hitt , also made significant contributions to the bill . Madam Speaker , Chairman Smith has , once again , done a masterful job leading us through this process , and I urge all of my colleagues to support the NDAA . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio ( Mr. Turner ) . Mr. TURNER . Madam Speaker , I support the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 . Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers , as well as the chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee , Jim Cooper , this year 's NDAA was , once again , compiled and reported for consideration on the floor today in a bipartisan manner . This bill is also the product of the diligent work of the committee staff whom I would like to thank including the Strategic Forces Subcommittee 's PSMs , Maria Vastola , Grant Schneider , Ryan Tully , Whitney Verett , and Zach Taylor , as well as the committee 's majority staff director , Paul Arcangeli , and minority staff director , Chris Vieson . Admiral Richard , the Commander of U.S. Strategic Command , has told us we are facing a situation our Nation has not encountered before . We must deter two peer nuclear-capable competitors simultaneously and must do so with each being deterred differently . I am confident that the FY 2022 NDAA before us today places us on the right path to properly observe both Russia and China . First and foremost , the bill increases top line defense spending by nearly $ 25 billion , reversing the harmful and reckless cuts from the President 's budget , ensuring an annual growth of 5 percent over the previous year , and funding the DOD 's most critical unfunded priorities . Next , with one exception , the NDAA continues to fully fund programs within the Department of Defense and Department of Energy that modernize the Nation 's nuclear triad and modernize the nuclear command , control , and communications systems . This is especially critical to maintaining a safe , secure , and reliable strategic deterrent while China is undergoing an unprecedented and massive nuclear build-up and Russia is undertaking significant modernization of all three legs of its triad . Also , both Russia and China are developing brand-new , novel nuclear delivery systems . This NDAA fully funds capabilities necessary for the defense of Guam and prohibits reduction of our ICBM inventory while simultaneously halting efforts to retire or reconvert our low-yield nuclear warheads , which are currently deployed in defense of our Nation . And this NDAA reverses President Biden 's detrimental and dangerous budgetary cuts to our missile defense systems . Madam Speaker , I encourage all Members to support this bill . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maine ( Mr. Golden ) , who is a member of the committee . Mr. GOLDEN . Madam Speaker , I rise in support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 . This measure , which passed out of our committee with a strong bipartisan vote , reflects our commitment to strengthening our national security and serving those who serve all of us . I am particularly proud of the efforts of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee . This bill reflects the constructive input of members of the subcommittee from both sides of the aisle and makes a strong mark on our national security priorities on , above , and below the seas . For shipbuilding , the bill expands on the budget request to authorize 13 battle force ships . This reflects our committee 's focused effort to scrub the budget and our shipbuilding plans to augment our Navy fleet responsibly and consistently in a manner which our industrial base can support to respond to emerging threats around the world . This includes the sustained construction of two Virginia-class submarines a year and continued production of the Columbia-class submarine program . We augment our surface capabilities by authorizing three new DDG 51 destroyers , one of our most capable surface platforms , and authorizing the Navy to seek a new contract for up to 15 ships over the next 5 years . This bill also continues the committee 's efforts to provide the Navy and Defense Department with tools needed to concurrently build the new 12 sub Columbia class without suffocating the rest of the Navy 's fleet . Specifically , the bill expands the authority of the National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund to allow for multiyear , continuous production of key components . Recent data from the Navy shows that the use of this authority since our subcommittee enacted it in 2015 has already saved the Navy $ 1.4 billion in the Columbia program to the tune of over $ 100 million per boat . This bill will increase those cost savings by expanding the scope of those tools to other components of the platform . The bill also includes full funding to start the new sealift Tanker Security Program , an initiative we passed last year to get more U.S.- built tankers to sea . The bill supports the budget request for the fifth planned National Security Multi-Mission Vessel , another initiative to boost maritime training and sealift capacity . At every step of the way , our subcommittee and the full committee accommodated many bipartisan initiatives throughout this process . That is how the legislative process should work , and we are proud that our committee remains a place for constructive bipartisan collaboration . Madam Speaker , on behalf of our Nation 's security , I urge support for the bill . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado ( Mr. Lamborn ) , who is the ranking member of the Readiness Subcommittee . Mr. LAMBORN . Madam Speaker , I thank the gentleman for yielding . [ [ Page H4800 ] ] Madam Speaker , I rise today in support of H.R . 4350 . We have maintained the bipartisan tradition of the Armed Services Committee . Now , while this administration promotes weakness abroad and tyranny at home , robust support for defense in this bill ensures that our adversaries understand that our military has the resources required to stymy their aggressive ambitions which will guarantee that our military will succeed if called upon . This legislation will enhance readiness by funding the unfunded requests of the services and the co-coms . It will maintain our commitment to the nuclear triad and modernization and aggressively enhance our space capabilities . It protects our troops against punishment for personal politics , prohibits dishonorable discharge for COVID vaccination refusal , and requires a plan for exemptions . And it begins to hold the Biden administration accountable for Afghanistan . Now , while this bill fosters U.S.-Israeli cooperation , including $ 300 million for multiple collaborative programs , anti-Israel Democrats have stripped the continuing resolution of $ 1 billion for the Iron Dome missile defense system . What does it say about the Progressive Caucus that they object to Israeli citizens defending themselves from missile attacks ? It is reprehensible and anti-Semitic . Nevertheless , this bill as it currently stands is a bipartisan bill . I thank the chairman and ranking member for maintaining the collaborative nature of our committee . I want to thank especially the chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee , John Garamendi , for his leadership and commitment to bipartisanship . I thank my readiness team , Ian , Dave , and Whitney , for their invaluable hard work during this process . Madam Speaker , I encourage a `` yes '' vote . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California ( Mr. Garamendi ) , who is the chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee . Mr. GARAMENDI . Madam Speaker , today I rise in support of the fiscal year 2022 NDAA . I would like to start by thanking Chairman Smith ; Ranking Member Rogers ; and my colleague on the subcommittee , Mr. Lamborn ; and , of course , the House Armed Services staff who have worked many long nights putting this NDAA together . The bill that is before the House is a good bill , and I encourage my colleagues to support it . The jurisdiction of the Readiness Subcommittee covers a broad range of topics from civilian personnel , sustainment , and contested logistics to military construction , energy safety and environmental policy . With that in mind , I would just like to highlight some of the issues we have dealt with . Consistent with our work over the last 2 years , the readiness provisions continue efforts to address the climate change challenges of extreme weather and the necessity to reduce the greenhouse gas emitted by the U.S. military -- the largest single emitter in the world . We require each installation to develop a master plan to do these things . The health and safety of our servicemembers will always be a top priority of the subcommittee . The bill elevates the department 's focus on safety by establishing the Joint Safety Council and requiring the DOD to develop a plan for the establishment of a Mishap Investigation Review Board to provide oversight and independent review of safety and mishap investigations . This mark continues the subcommittee 's work to improve the conditions for the servicemembers and their quality-of-life infrastructures , such as military family housing , barracks , and child development centers . We also step up the military 's requirement to address the PFAS contamination on and off bases . The bill helps advance our military 's near-term readiness goals and drives the department to plan for and take action against long-term threats . Madam Speaker , I urge my colleagues to support the fiscal year 2022 NDAA . Madam Speaker , today I rise in support of the fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act ( NDAA ) . I would like to start by thanking Chairman Smith , Ranking Member Rogers , and the House Armed Services Committee staff who have worked many long nights putting together this year 's NDAA . The bill that is before the House is a good bill , and I encourage my colleagues to support its passage . As the Chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee , I believe the bill upholds our responsibility to provide congressional oversight of and support to the sustainment , logistics , infrastructure , and readiness of our military . I 'd like to take a moment and thank my staff for their tireless work -- the Readiness Subcommittee staff , Jeanine Womble , Melanie Harris , Jay Vallario , Wendell White , Ian Bennitt , Dave Sienicki , and Sean Falvey , and my personal staff , Betsy Thompson , Rebecca Wolf , and Scott Bohn . I am proud of the Readiness Subcommittee 's contribution to this year 's bill , and I 'd like to highlight the following provisions . Consistent with our work from the last two years , the Readiness provisions in the NDAA continue efforts to address the climate change challenges of extreme weather and the necessity to reduce the greenhouse gases emitted by the U.S. military , the largest single entity in the world . The bill : Requires each military department to complete installation master plans at two of their most at-risk installations within one year of enactment ; Requires the Department to amend DOD building codes to require consideration of microgrids with islanding capability as part of planned new construction , and encourages the department to renegotiate contracts related to existing on-installation renewable energy projects to enhance installation resiliency during power disruptions ; Requires installation commanders to consult with local governments to ensure installation master plans include outside the fence line resiliency considerations ; Requires the Department to assess energy and water usage at existing data centers and set conservation goals for new data centers ; and Requires the Department to include EV charging infrastructure needs in their planning for new domestic military construction , and requires the Department to adopt industry standard planning considerations in the development and rollout of charging infrastructure at military installations . The bill also builds on efforts to address contested logistics challenges involving near-peer competitors by strengthening operational energy programs : Requires the Department to create a working group of program planners , energy staff , joint staff , and geographic combatant commands to enhance integration of military department energy initiatives into operational planning and platform development to combat contested logistics challenges ; Requires the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy , Installations , and Environment to report on alternative fuels and mandates the conduct of a wholistic review of the associated production , transportation , geopolitical , commercial , and research and development of alternative energy ; and Requires the Secretary of Defense to designate a Combatant Command as the agency responsible for global bulk fuel storage , delivery , and distribution , and directs the so-designated Combatant Command to conduct a strategy on the infrastructure and programs necessary to optimally support global bulk fuel management of the Department of Defense . The FY22 NDAA also builds on the Committee 's previous legislative and oversight activities to address poor conditions in barracks , child development centers and housing : Requires the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy , Installations , and Environment to report on and provide a list of domestic facilities and average facility childcare wait list , assess efforts to find solutions and reduce wait times , assess the extent to which staffing availability impacts childcare availability , and assess whether including childcare facilities in agreements for new private housing would be an effective solution ; Requires the military departments to conduct safety inspections and develop 10-year facility improvement plans for child development centers ; and Requires the Department to place higher priority on the sustainment of quality-of-life facilities such as barracks by setting aside a percentage of infrastructure sustainment funds for that purpose . Additionally , the bill builds on the committee 's oversight activities to address preventable training accidents and build a culture of safety in the military departments : Establishes a Joint Safety Council within the Office of the Deputy Secretary of Defense that advises on all operational safety matters , establishes safety standards , collects and analyzes safety data , and develops safety priorities ; Addresses concerns about the quality and objectivity of the military department 's mishap investigations by directing the Deputy Secretary of Defense to develop a plan for the establishment of a Mishap Investigation Review [ [ Page H4801 ] ] Board , which would provide oversight and independent review of mishap investigations ; Requires the Secretaries of the Army and Marine Corps to develop a plan to address the recommendations contained in GAO 's recent report on tactical vehicle mishaps ; and Requires the Secretary of Defense to review the risks , benefits , and plans for enhancing the protections for combat uniforms in an effort to protect service members from flash fires . Furthermore , the bill continues efforts to address contamination associated with per- and polyfluorinated compounds on and around military installations : Requires the Department of Defense to review current practices to prevent or mitigate AFFF spills and promulgate best practices for spill prevention and mitigation , enterprise wide ; Increases transparency and facilitates information-sharing with defense communities impacted by PFAS contamination ; and Places a temporary moratorium on the incineration of PFAS- contaminated materials until DOD adopts and promulgates EPA interim guidance for disposal . The bill continues to build on efforts to support the Department of Defense civilian workforce : Requires the Secretary of Defense to provide a report detailing the number of military , civilian , and contractor personnel assigned to or employed by OSD over the past ten years , to assess whether the number of civilian billets in OSD-Policy has kept pace with changes in the organization 's mission over time , and to provide a recommendation as to whether an increase to OSD 's statutory personnel caps is necessary to ensure sufficient civilian staffing and enable corrective action for any inappropriate contracting ; Prohibits changes to the size or function of the Naval Audit Service until the Comptroller General completes a report on the operations of the Naval Audit Service ; Requires the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan to address the recommendations contained in the Comptroller General of the United States report entitled `` Sexual Harassment and Assault : Guidance Needed to Ensure Consistent Tracking , Response , and Training for Department of Defense Civilians ; '' and Requires that the Secretary of Defense to establish relevant metrics , collect and report on diversity statistics , and report on the status of diversity and inclusion efforts among the civilian work force . The bill also continues efforts to ensure modern weapons systems are sustainable and affordable over time and to support our industrial base : Requires the Comptroller General to report on organic maintenance capability and capacity within the F-35 program including depot standup , technical data requirements , unique tooling , and contractor assistance in depot standup ; assess the potential to transition supply- chain management from a contractor-led to a government-led function , and ; assess key field-level maintenance challenges as well as mitigating actions . Requires the Comptroller General to provide annual reports in the years 2022-2025 on the F-35 program sustainment system , including an analysis of the sustainment strategy , an analysis of the Department 's ability to reduce costs toward affordability metrics , and an analysis of the Department 's efforts to provide oversight of key contractor-led sustainment functions . Requires the Secretary of Defense to initiate a pilot program to develop a digital twin of the facilities and operations of at least one government-owned and operated military depot that is not a shipyard . Requires the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition , Logistics , and Technology to review efforts to digitize field-level maintenance for ground vehicles . The FY22 NDAA supports the missions at Travis and Beale Air Force Bases in my district , and I 'm also pleased this NDAA includes a 2.7 percent pay raise for our troops . Additional provisions that I was instrumental in securing include : Requiring the Secretary of Defense to continue the FireGuard program , where the National Guard assists in detecting and monitoring wildfires , for at least the next five years ; Including bill language that adds transparency to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program , and that aligns requirements for charter transportation of both Department of Defense personnel and cargo ; Prohibiting the use of open-air burn pits during overseas contingency operations unless an exemption is issued by the President of The United States for a particular location . Thirty days after an exemption is granted , the President would be required to submit a report to Congress detailing the location , size , duration , and need of the burn pit , the number of personnel assigned to the location , and the personal protective equipment or other methods that will be used by those personnel to mitigate the health effects of said pit ; Directing the Department to pay fees associated with the transfer of adopted dogs to the adoption agency or individual and directing the inclusion of veterinary care and services into the Joint Trauma Education and Training Directorate ; Including significant Facilities Sustainment , Restoration , and Modernization ( FSRM ) projects on DOD 's online listing of military construction projects and MILCON contracting awards ; and Authorizing the Maritime Administrator to use appropriated funds to purchase duplicate medals authorized under the Merchant Mariners of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2020 . This awards the Congressional Gold Medal -- one of our nation 's highest honors -- to the Merchant Marine Veterans of World War II . This bill helps advance our military 's near-term readiness goals and drives the Department to plan for and take action against long-term threats , and with that , I urge my colleagues to support the FY22 NDAA . { time } 2130 Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia ( Mr. Wittman ) , the ranking member of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee . Mr. WITTMAN . Madam Speaker , I thank the ranking member for yielding . I want to preface by saying that I do not agree with everything in this bill , but the committee-passed bill is worthy of support . I want to especially thank Ranking Member Rogers and Chairman Smith for their attention to minimizing extraneous provisions in the markup that have little to do with our national security or supporting our servicemembers . Our struggle to close conference last year because of these issues were wholly associated with provisions that are not connected to national security . And these attempts , I believe , were offensive , and similar attempts to include these unnecessary provisions this year should be rebuffed . Unfortunately , Speaker Pelosi has not listened to the lessons learned from last year 's conference and has decided to add several non-germane bills to the NDAA at Rules that have nothing to do with defense . I want to make this clear for my colleagues offering these amendments : We should not use servicemembers as a tool to achieve partisan gain . I repeat : We should not use servicemembers as a tool to achieve partisan gain . And I voted in opposition to the rule , but I hope that I can vote for final passage of this year 's NDAA . As to the committee mark , we started with an anemic budget request from the Biden administration that in the Seapower portfolio requested only eight ships , two of which were fleet tugboats . How the administration can set China as the pacing threat and reduce Navy force structure is simply baffling . Fortunately , with the leadership of Ranking Member Rogers and others on the committee , we were able to authorize additional funds to the defense top line to provide the real growth necessary to dissuade future conflict . With this , we authorized 13 battle force ships and rebuffed the administration 's request to retire three cruisers . Additionally , we sought to expand the submarine industrial base by authorizing funds that enable a submarine construction build rate of three by 2025 . The mark also includes critical capabilities to support our Nation 's deterrence with continued strong investments in the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine and the B-21 Raider bomber . I think this is a good bill in its current form , and it is worthy of my colleagues ' support . MR. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield myself 1\\1/2\\ minutes just to address a couple things the gentleman from Virginia said . I want to be clear , it is the longstanding practice of our committee that we take issues that are not in our jurisdiction . We have done it under Republican leadership . We have done it under Democratic leadership . It is also the longstanding practice of our committee to work with the committees of jurisdiction , and only if in a bipartisan , bicameral way those committees of jurisdiction agree , does it ultimately go into the conference report . So you do n't need to be afraid of stuff that you do n't like . Work with [ [ Page H4802 ] ] your committees of jurisdiction and it goes into the conference report if we get agreement . If it does n't , it does n't . Second , last year that is not what held us up . The two things that held us up last year were one thing that was very much within the jurisdiction of this committee , and that was whether or not to rename military bases ; to change the names of the bases named for Confederates , very much in our jurisdiction . And the second thing was President Trump 's last-second desire , out of nowhere , to add section 230 to the bill . We were n't held up by these things , and we will not be held up this year . If the committees of jurisdiction do not agree , we do n't do it . We just have that negotiation . If they can , we give them a ride . So do n't need to worry about that . It is a good bill . Go ahead and vote for it . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California ( Ms. Speier ) , the chairwoman of the Military Personnel Subcommittee . Ms. SPEIER . Madam Speaker , I am proud to speak in support of this bill which passed out of our committee with overwhelming bipartisan support . This year 's NDAA continues the committee 's tradition of improving the lives of servicemembers and their families by supporting a 2.7 percent pay raise ; increasing parental leave for new mothers and fathers , including adoptive and foster parents ; expanding financial assistance for in-home child care ; improving the legal representation for exceptional family members ; and demanding an independent review of suicides . Following the horrifying murder of Specialist Vanessa Guillen and a ground swell of activism from survivors of military sexual trauma , H.R . 4350 also boldly confronts sexual assault and harassment in the military , which has been one of my top priorities for a decade , by removing the commander from decisions related to prosecution of special victim crimes , improving sexual harassment investigations , and continuing to improve military criminal investigative resources . It also establishes standalone offenses for sexual harassment and violent extremism under the Uniform Code of Military Justice . These reforms will increase trust in the military justice system and encourage survivors of sexual violence to come forward . The bill also requires an independent review of whether to transfer additional offenses such as murder that are out of the chain of command . Where servicemembers serve , so do their families . That has been our mantra on this subcommittee , which is why this bill ensures that the military health system continues to have sufficient providers to meet beneficiaries ' healthcare needs . H.R . 4350 also improves services covered under TRICARE , including contraception , without copays . Together , servicemembers and their families make sacrifices for our Nation , and we must continue our commitment to them . I want to thank the ranking member , Congressman Mike Gallagher , the extraordinary staff of the committee : Ilka Regino , David Giachetti , Hannah Kaufman , Glen Diehl , and the fearless Staff Director Paul Arcangeli , and also Josh Connolly and Brian Collins from my staff . Thanks to Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers for an extraordinary NDAA . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri ( Mrs. Hartzler ) , the ranking member of the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee . Mrs. HARTZLER . Madam Speaker , each year Congress considers one of the most important pieces of legislation , the National Defense Authorization Act . I applaud the bipartisan leadership of Chairman Adam Smith and Ranking Member Mike Rogers . And as the ranking member of the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee , I want to thank our subcommittee chairman , Donald Norcross , for his collaborative , bipartisan efforts . I am pleased the committee approved a bipartisan amendment in markup to increase the top line by $ 23.9 billion . This increase is needed to continue the progress we have made in rebuilding readiness and will facilitate modernization programs necessary to prepare our military forces to compete with , deter , and win against peer challengers and adversaries . Under the subcommittee 's jurisdiction , this bill continues critical oversight of the Air Force , Navy , and Marine Corps ' strike-fighter force structure and inventory management , setting better conditions for ensuring the right mix of fourth and fifth generation fighters , and managing operational risk . Specifically , this legislation authorizes funding for 80 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters , 24 F-15EX aircraft , and 12 F/A-18 Super Hornets . The legislation also reverses several proposed cuts , including procurement for the Army 's small caliber ammunition accounts . It also facilitates stronger oversight to ensure current ISR and counter UAS capabilities and capacity are maintained and prioritized to mitigate near-term operational risk and prevent future capability gaps . Outside the subcommittee 's jurisdiction , I am pleased that this bill includes several provisions regarding the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan , including my provision requiring an accounting of the decision to leave Bagram Air Base . I am also pleased this legislation includes two of my bills , the CADET Act and the Connecting the Community to End Military Suicide Act . I do have concerns with several provisions in the underlying bill , including the selective service , and I am hopeful we can work in a bipartisan manner to address those . I encourage support . MR. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey ( Mr. Norcross ) , the chair of the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee . Mr. NORCROSS . Madam Speaker , I thank the chairman for his work and commitment to this country 's security . Madam Speaker , this bill continues the long , proud tradition of bipartisan work for the Tactical Air and Land Subcommittee ; our commitment to securing our Nation and willingness to work through and share responsibility for the tough choices resulting in this bill , a bill that keeps America 's land and air forces the best in the world . I particularly want to thank our ranking member , Mrs. Hartzler , for her input , her steadfast support in building this strong , bipartisan bill . Certainly , though we may disagree at times , we put the safety and security of our Nation and servicemen first and work together to pass this vital piece of legislation . I also want to thank our vice chair , Representative Sherrill of New Jersey , for her help . Madam Speaker , this bill equips and modernizes our Armed Forces by carefully and thoughtfully managing resources . At the same time , this bill continues the necessary oversight to ensure responsibility of the execution by the DOD . This bill enacts : Vigorous oversight of our most complex and expensive program , the F-35 , certainly an ambitious modernization strategy by the Army and a host of others ; and of particular importance to me and Mrs. Hartzler , strong support for risk reduction in our defense industrial base . To this point , this bill also includes my Buy American provision , which brings back jobs to the U.S. and can ensure that we get what we need when we need it , securing our fragile supply chain . I do want to take a moment in closing to thank the subcommittee staff , those who serve on this committee , certainly , led by Bill Sutey , Heath Bope , Carla Zeppieri , Liz Griffin , and Kelly Repair , and the last day of our clerk , Caroline , who has done a wonderful job ; and to my personal staff , Katie Lee , Chris Macleish , and Mark Moses . This is a bill that America can support and , certainly , we are encouraging all our Members to support this NDAA for fiscal year ` 22 . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi ( Mr. Kelly ) , the ranking member of the Intelligence and Special Operations Subcommittee . Mr. KELLY of Mississippi . Madam Speaker , today I rise in strong support of the FY22 NDAA . Our military has and is facing unprecedented challenges , and this body is duty-bound to ensure [ [ Page H4803 ] ] our military is adequately funded and has the tools to win . We also do this by empowering American companies and the industrial base that provides goods and services to the DOD . The hardworking Mississippians who work for companies like Airbus , Huntington Ingalls , Winchester , General Dynamics , Stark Aerospace , SpaceX and General Atomics keep our Nation safe and deserve the support of our Congress . This bill includes a Republican amendment boosting the defense top line by nearly $ 25 billion and reverses the administration 's reckless cuts to our national security , restoring funding for shipbuilding , procurement , missile defense , and modernization . This bill will also fund the unfunded top priorities of our military that the White House failed to support . Once passed , this bill further bolsters our military 's ability to maintain its dominance in every domain , and ensures military leaders have the resources to take care of servicemembers and military families . Additionally , this year 's NDAA will begin the process of holding the White House accountable for the mistakes in Afghanistan . For months , we have asked for more detail on the so-called over-the-horizon strategy to conduct counterterrorism . We received scant details ahead of the withdrawal , and America deserves answers to why the withdrawal was so unorganized in planning and execution run by the Commander in Chief and the State Department . The lack of planning leading up to the withdrawal and the continued inability to maintain control on the ground by this administration is staggering . The Armed Services Committee , particularly this Subcommittee on Intelligence and Special Operations , will not allow these weaknesses of the administration to continue to place our citizens , allies , partners , and overall national security at risk . This year 's bill calls for the administration to provide a plan to get the rest of the American citizens out . Finally , I would be remiss without asking about my teammates , which is Tony Starks , Colin Hawkins , and Rodney Hall , professional staffer , Patrick Nevins , and my battle buddy in all of this , Ranking Member Gallego . I ask my colleagues to support this bill . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona ( Mr. Gallego ) , the chair of the Intelligence and Special Operations Subcommittee . Mr. GALLEGO . Madam Speaker , I rise today in support of H.R . 4350 , the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2022 . I congratulate my colleagues for fulfilling our obligation to debate and pass the National Defense Authorization Act . This year 's bill contains multiple provisions to address strategic challenges presented by China , to confront our adversaries in the gray zone of conflict , and to strengthen the relationships with key allies and partners . As chair of the Intelligence and Special Operations Subcommittee , I am proud of the provisions in this bill that represent critical reforms to the defense intelligence enterprise , special operations forces , our ability to counter weapons of mass destruction . { time } 2145 Our bill creates more agility across the defense intelligence enterprise by breaking down barriers to information sharing to enhance warfighters and combatant commanders in their ability to counter China and Russia in the information environment and focusing on expanding access to partners such as India and our steadfast Nordic partners such as Finland . The bill further supports rigorous oversight of our security posture in Afghanistan and includes provisions to better understand the Department 's plans to address the threat environment while postured in an over-the-horizon capacity . Importantly , the bill also contains $ 500 million in relocation support for Afghan SIV holders . Finally , our bill authorizes an increase of $ 105 million to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program , which will enhance our efforts to detect and fight emergent chemical and biological threats and develop medical countermeasures such as vaccines and therapeutics . Most importantly , I want to thank subcommittee Ranking Member Trent Kelly for his contribution to this bill and his bipartisanship , which helped create the foundations of such a strong bill during a particularly challenging year . I would also like to thank the staff -- Shannon Green , Jessica Carroll , Zachary Taylor , and Patrick Nevins -- for their tireless efforts to get it across the finish line . Colleagues , in addition to meeting the most pressing security challenges we face as a Nation today , this bill supports our servicemembers with a 2.7 percent pay raise , increases parental leave for military families , improves women 's healthcare , and combats extremism in the military . Madam Speaker , this is a good bill , and I urge my colleagues to support it . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin ( Mr. Gallagher ) , the ranking member of the Military Personnel Subcommittee . Mr. GALLAGHER . Madam Speaker , I stand before you today in proud support of this bipartisan bill , which is a reflection of the hard work of both sides that went into this . This process remains some of the most gratifying work that we do in Congress and a testament to the way in which this institution can work when we put our mind to it . The FY22 NDAA includes a top-line budget that restores funding for shipbuilding , procurement , missile defense , and a number of other priorities that will help ensure the national defense of our great Nation . The bill that was voted out of committee continues to support and improve the lives of those who sacrifice for our country on a daily basis by authorizing a military basic pay raise of 2.7 percent . This bill reinforces the committee 's longstanding commitment to the military family by requiring the Department of Defense to increase parental leave , expands the in-home childcare pilot program , and improves support available to military families with special needs children . This bill also addresses the threat of COVID-19 by prohibiting the use of DOD funds to conduct research , including biomedical , infectious disease , and genomic research in China or with any entity controlled by the Chinese Communist Party . It requires DOD to report to Congress on the number of military personnel infected with coronavirus at the 2019 Military World Games in Wuhan , China , and requires DOD and the Director of National Intelligence to assess the involvement of the Chinese Communist Party in the origins of COVID-19 . I thank the chairman and ranking member for an outstanding bipartisan bill . I thank them both for their work on it , and I am proud to be a member of this committee . Let 's do our duty . Let 's support servicemembers , military families , and retirees . Let 's pass this bill . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , at this time , I have no further speakers , and I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana ( Mr. Banks ) , the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Cyber , Innovative Technologies , and Information Systems . Mr. BANKS . Madam Speaker , I rise today in support of H.R . 4350 , the FY22 NDAA . Our current and future warfighting capabilities are contingent on modernizing the Department of Defense and recruiting and equipping the military with the most effective , secure , and cutting-edge technologies . Our adversaries are focused on our defeat on and off the battlefield . They are pouring money into research and development of emerging technologies , recruiting top scientists , and stealing intellectual property to gain a tactical edge . This NDAA pushes the Department to accelerate innovation and strengthen its cyber posture , a critical capability if we want to maintain superiority in the era of great power competition . I want to thank Ranking Member Rogers , who , because of his leadership , fought for and gained nearly $ 25 billion in this bill to boost emerging technologies and cybersecurity programs during the markup . [ [ Page H4804 ] ] These funds enhance areas like hypersonics , AI , and quantum computing and make a historical investment to renovate the Department 's labs and testing facilities . As ranking member , I am also proud of the work that we have done on our subcommittee , the Cyber , Innovative Technologies , and Information Systems Subcommittee led by Chairman Langevin , in this inaugural NDAA for this subcommittee . We included provisions to transition innovative technologies quickly into the hands of the warfighter , to help companies bridge the valley of death , and to implement many of the recommendations of the National Security Commission on AI . In the past year , we have seen landmark cyberattacks , a trend which is likely to continue , and we must be prepared . We bolster and strengthen the Department 's information security systems and improve sharing and analysis of cyber threat information across the Department . Madam Speaker , I strongly support this bill and encourage my colleagues to do the same . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska ( Mr. Bacon ) , a great member of the Armed Services Committee . Mr. BACON . Madam Speaker , I rise in support of the National Defense Authorization Act . I commend the outstanding leadership of Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Mike Rogers for delivering strong , bipartisan legislation that provides for our common defense . While I am personally grateful that this bill includes dozens of my provisions , I am most proud of the fact that the bill sends a clear bipartisan message that we must keep our national defense spending level with inflation and reject the temptation to cut defense when our allies and enemies are questioning American leadership . As the White House 's own strategic guidance states , America must confront global challenges from a position of strength , not weakness . I am also proud that this bill includes multiple provisions ensuring oversight and accountability for the recent debacle in Afghanistan . As we stand here today , this crisis is ongoing , with hundreds of U.S. citizens and residents , including my constituents from Nebraska , who are still trapped in Afghanistan . Oversight of the way the botched withdrawal was handled is not and should not be a partisan issue , and I am proud that the House has not backed away from its responsibilities . Madam Speaker , I urge support of this bill . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah ( Mr. Moore ) , one of our outstanding freshman Members . Mr. MOORE of Utah . Madam Speaker , I rise in opposition to the MILCON amendment . This is actually something that we agree on , that most people would agree on . We have apartments that our airmen are staying in at Hill Air Force Base where literally they have to section off corners of the sidewalk because bricks are falling off the building . This is not up to the standard of what we would like to provide for our men and women who are willing to go and serve in this capacity . This is something that we all agree on . The reason I stand to oppose the amendment is because it just increases the costs for a MILCON budget that is already laden with a lot of work with very little money . This will require a sort of preference for local hiring , which is a good thing , but it also adds in a lot of bureaucracy with respect to licensing and making sure that every single military construction contractor has all the little prerequisites for each State . This is something that we have rejected in the past , and it ultimately just adds a lot of cost . It is ironic that both the Trump and Biden administrations disagree with this . Chambers of commerce actually oppose this . A few others that are noteworthy are the defense industry of America , Association of General Contractors , and American Council of Engineering Companies . They all oppose this effort . Again , this impacts the skilled workforce . Every single construction company that I talk to right now says they ca n't even hire in their local area . So to require companies to go to each area where there is a base and take away some of their skilled workforce to then go hire a workforce that is in that particular city , it adds an extra burden . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Oklahoma ( Mrs. Bice ) , an outstanding member of our Armed Services Committee . Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma . Madam Speaker , I rise today in support of H.R . 4350 , this year 's National Defense Authorization Act . As a member of the Armed Services Committee , I was honored to have a seat at the table in crafting this legislation , and I am pleased to have been successful in having a good number of my priorities for Oklahoma 's Fifth District included in this bill . As a new member of the House Armed Services Committee , I was deeply concerned when President Biden proposed earlier this year to essentially cut our defense budget below the rate of inflation at a time when we are facing serious threats from around the world . I am thankful for the leadership of Ranking Member Rogers in securing a bipartisan deal in this bill to provide the additional resources needed to meet our Nation 's defense needs . This bill makes important investments to protect our Nation from dangerous adversaries like Russia and China . I also fought to include several items in the bill we are considering today , including a measure I co-led with Congresswoman Gonzalez-Colon to require DOD to survey access to mental health and suicide prevention services within the military healthcare system , as well as a modified version of my bill to protect servicemembers and their families with disabilities from being charged out-of-pocket expenses for needed ADA upgrades to their on-base housing unit . Lastly , I successfully advanced amendments to require the DOD to analyze the security threats resulting from the Taliban 's release of thousands of prisoners from Bagram Air Base and an amendment to increase resources for the Army National Guard to assist CBP with security operations on the southern border in light of the growing threats emanating from Afghanistan and elsewhere . Bottom line , this bill strengthens our Nation 's defenses , supports our brave servicemembers , and sustains important defense programs across the Nation and in my home State of Oklahoma . Madam Speaker , certainly there may be provisions of this bill that not everyone agrees with , but I urge my colleagues to support the bill . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee ( Mr. DesJarlais ) , another fine member of the Armed Services Committee . Mr. DesJARLAIS . Madam Speaker , I rise today to express my support for the National Defense Authorization Act . The bill before us today represents a much-improved effort over the Biden-Harris administration 's proposed budget . There is no more important job than providing for the defense of our Nation . The specter of threats from an aggressive China , a revitalized Russia , and radical Islamic terrorist states demand that we maintain a strong national defense readiness and posture . This NDAA will give a much-deserved and needed pay raise and expanded benefits to members of our armed services . We are making investments to ensure our military is the best equipped and trained in the world , with a focus on American jobs and our domestic manufacturing base . We are also investing in important new technologies like quantum computing , hypersonic weapons , and autonomous systems . I am proud to say that Arnold Air Force Base , the University of Tennessee Space Institute , Vanderbilt University , Fort Campbell Army Base , Oak [ [ Page H4805 ] ] Ridge National Laboratory , and other Tennessee stakeholders will receive the funds that they need to carry out vital operations for our United States military . That said , the bill is not perfect . I am disappointed in House Democrats for preventing my `` no first use '' amendment from coming to the floor for a vote . In hearings before our committee , our military leadership emphasized that a `` no first use '' policy is a limiting strategic mistake , and a number of our allies have expressed these concerns directly to me as well . We should never tip our strategic plans to our adversaries . It is also disappointing that those on the other side of the aisle have taken a bill intended to improve our military and muddled it with attempts to score political points . { time } 2200 While I do n't support these poison pills , I am hopeful that my colleagues will remove them during conference before its final passage . That said , we must move forward with this legislation . I support making it stronger , avoiding nongermane political issues , and getting it signed into law for our brave men and women in uniform . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I continue to reserve the balance of my time . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida ( Mr. Gaetz ) , another fine member of the Armed Services Committee . Mr. GAETZ . Madam Speaker , on behalf of the tens of thousands of military families in northwest Florida , I rise in strong support of this year 's National Defense Authorization Act . This bill does right by military families by ensuring that we upgrade training systems , increasing their proficiency , and ensuring that our servicemembers are safe when they go down range . The bill enhances platforms and equipment survivability to ensure that our troops are in the best possible position to prevail in every battle and vanquish any foe . The 2.7 percent pay raise is vastly needed and is a small debt of gratitude for the elite level of patriotism that our servicemembers show each and every day . The bill does right by the mission by investing in research , development test and evaluation by increasing our investment in cyber , by ensuring that we have a military construction budget that allows us to meet ambitious goals to be able to grow strategic mission in particular areas , and our investment in the space force ensures that America will always hold the high ground . With this legislation , America wins the future by focusing on great power competition , and by ensuring that we win that great power competition with great focus and great competence . I thank the bipartisan leadership of the committee , and I would note that that bipartisan leadership has been necessary because President Biden 's initial budget did not meet the needs of the country to the same degree that this House will . It is a testament to Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers that brighter minds have prevailed . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I continue to reserve the balance of my time . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Madam Speaker , as I have made clear , I feel very strongly that this is a really strong , bipartisan bill . I urge all Members of the House to support it . Madam Speaker , I yield back the balance of my time . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Madam Speaker , I yield myself the balance of my time . I just want to agree with Mr. Rogers . This bill , as you can hear from the Members speaking in favor of it on both sides of the aisle , encompasses a lot of different provisions , all designed to make sure we can adequately defend the country ; and , most importantly , designed to make sure that we protect the men and women who are serving us to protect that country . There are a lot of provisions in this bill focused on improving the quality of life , including a 2.7 percent pay increase and significant increases to improve things like childcare centers and barracks across the country . I think this bill does an excellent job of identifying the threats that we face and putting ourselves in the best possible position to meet those threats going forward . Again , no bill is perfect . We disagree on things . Everyone will have something in here that they wish were slightly different , but overall , I think we can support this bill . I do want to close by once again emphasizing , I know there is a lot of angst about the amendments that have been ruled in order ; but , again , that is not unusual that we would deal with issues that are not necessarily directly within our jurisdiction . We work with the committees of jurisdiction in order to carry those bills . We will continue to work on that . I can say with confidence that there is no amendment that has been ruled in order that we are going to debate on that should impact any Members voting for this bill . This is a very strong bill . Do not forget the underlying provisions in this bill that are so important to the men and women who are serving this country , to the protections they need , the protections they deserve , and the protections that it is our obligation to provide for them and which I feel very , very strongly that this bill does . This bill deserves support from this committee . I urge a `` yes '' vote . Madam Speaker , I yield back the balance of my time . The SPEAKER pro tempore . All time for debate has expired . Each further amendment printed in part C of House Report 117-125 not earlier considered as part of the amendments en bloc pursuant to section 4 of House Resolution 667 , shall be considered only in the order printed in the report , may be offered only by a Member designated in the report , shall be considered as read , shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent , may be withdrawn by the proponent at any time before the question is put thereon , shall not be subject to amendment , and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question . It shall be in order at any time for the chair of the Committee on Armed Services or his designee to offer amendments en bloc consisting of further amendments printed in part C of House Report 117-125 , not earlier disposed of . Amendments en bloc shall be considered as read , shall be debatable for 30 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Armed Services or their respective designees , shall not be subject to amendment , and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question .

      "Ms. PELOSI . Madam Speaker , I rise to support this bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act : which honors our values , supports our servicemembers and families , strengthens our security and advances our leadership in the world . Thank you to Chairman Smith , the Committee and staff for their patriotic , persistent leadership on this legislation , which reflects the brilliance and diversity of the whole House . This bill honors our responsibility to meet the needs of the servicemembers who sacrifice for our freedoms , and their families . It does so by : Providing a pay raise for our men and women in uniform , Strengthening parental leave for caregivers , Expanding access to child care , Improving the financial security of military members , including those who are low-income and have family members living with disabilities , Protecting military communities from PFAS `` forever chemicals . '' This NDAA also makes historic changes to better combat sexual assault in the military , including creating an Office of Special Victim Prosecutor within each service to prosecute crimes and criminalizing sexual harassment under the UCMJ ( Uniform Code of Military Justice ) . And it improves military health care , including related to mental health , women 's reproductive health and suicide prevention . In terms of protecting our security , there are many provisions of which to be proud in this NDAA . This legislation helps America combat our adversaries and invest in our alliances -- with strong action to deter China and Russia , fight transnational threats and counter violent extremism . And it brings our defense further into the 21st Century -- with an historic 36 percent increase in defense-wide research & development , $ 2.5 billion to fix aging infrastructure & support security-related R & D , $ 1 billion in new cybersecurity investments , over $ 1 billion for artificial intelligence efforts and investments in new partnerships with the private sector and academia , including HBCUs and Minority- Serving Institutions . This NDAA builds on Congress 's bipartisan action in passing Special Immigrant Visa ( SIV ) legislation to provide for the relocation of our Afghan allies and partners , as it authorizes $ 500 million for this effort . This bipartisan policy bill has been signed into law for 60 consecutive years . We all look forward to seeing the Congress continue this proud tradition , as we pass this NDAA on a bipartisan basis and send it to the President 's desk for his signature . Doing so allows us to honor the vision of our Founders , as set out in the Preamble , to `` provide for the common defense , '' and `` secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity . '' "

      "Mr. LANGEVIN . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . Mr. Speaker , the United States attracts and develops some of the brightest minds in the world . They can fortify national security and boost economic competitiveness . Unfortunately , much of that talent leaves because there are few options to remain . My amendment provides a pathway to citizenship for the best foreign talent to work in the U.S. in support of our National Security Innovation Base . Great power competition is a race for talent to maintain our military and technological superiority . We want the brightest minds in the world working for us , not the Chinese Communist Party . The U.S. has less than 5 percent of world 's population , so it is no surprise that many great scientific minds are born outside U.S. borders . So then how have we maintained our technological superiority over the last 70 years , by way of example ? Well , our world-class universities and innovative private sector attract future Nobel laureates in critical technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence . However , our constricted pathways to residency and citizenship drive this talent into the arms of our adversaries ; so we face intense competition from other countries who offer large research grants and expedited citizenship to lure this talent away . But it is not just potential adversaries . Some U.S. companies are setting up R & D facilities in Canada because their immigration policies more effectively attract highly-skilled workers . Under this amendment , the Secretary of Defense will implement a competitive annual process to select scientists with technical expertise in critical technologies and recommend them for proper processing and vetting . It is in our national security interests not only to have these scientists working on research on our behalf , but also to prevent this talent from working for our adversaries . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. TIFFANY . Mr. Speaker , I rise in opposition to the amendment . The SPEAKER pro tempore . The gentleman from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 minutes . Mr. TIFFANY . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . The ramifications of this amendment could be dangerous and far- reaching . Quite frankly , we should not be looking outside of the United States for such scientists and researchers . We should cultivate our own talent . Unfortunately , this bill does nothing to develop that talent . We must ask , which foreign nationals would be eligible for the program ? Most likely , those from China . China is so intent on using our U.S. immigration system to steal our sensitive technologies that the Trump administration had to issue a proclamation suspending entry of certain Chinese students and researchers . The Trump administration proclamation stated : `` The People 's Republic of China is engaged in a wide-ranging and heavily resourced campaign to acquire sensitive United States technologies . . . to bolster the modernization and capability of its military . '' The proclamation went on to state that `` students or researchers from the PRC studying beyond the undergraduate level . . . are at high risk of being exploited or co-opted by the PRC . '' Because of the brutal nature of the Chinese Communist Party , the same is true for virtually any Chinese national who comes to the United States to study or research , or to otherwise work in sensitive technologies like those contemplated under this amendment . In fact , the Department of Homeland Security told us last year that the Chinese government requires its nationals to `` support , assist , and cooperate with State intelligence work . '' The idea for this amendment came , at least in part , from the Commission on Artificial Intelligence , which called for `` increasing China brain drain . '' So clearly , the green cards contemplated under this amendment would go to Chinese nationals . The last thing we should do is make it easy for the Chinese Communist Party to gain access to our National Security Innovation Base work , Department of Defense research , or other critical technologies . I would also note that , sadly , the Department of Defense does not have a great track record regarding immigrant programs . Many of you may remember that the Department of Defense supported and encouraged the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest program through which foreign nationals were able to enlist in the U.S. military . Once enlisted , they were eligible to naturalize . The Department of Defense was not living up to its promise to adequately vet and perform high-level background checks on the MAVNI participants . The program was halted by the Obama administration when it was discovered that the Department had allowed some Chinese spies to enlist in the military . Let that sink in . The Department of Defense let Chinese spies enlist in the U.S. military . So I am not comfortable with several aspects of the program created by this amendment . I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. LANGEVIN . Mr. Speaker , how much time do I have remaining ? The SPEAKER pro tempore . The gentleman from Rhode Island has 3 minutes remaining . The gentleman from Wisconsin has 2 minutes remaining . [ [ Page H4956 ] ] Mr. LANGEVIN . Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from California ( Ms. Lofgren ) . Ms. LOFGREN . Mr. Speaker , I thank the gentleman for yielding . Mr. Speaker , I rise in strong support of this amendment that would allow a small number of special immigrant visas to the world 's top scientists and technical experts selected by the Secretary of Defense . I trust the Secretary of Defense looking out after the Nation 's security interests , and it is important that our security depends on having access to the top scientists in the world who are committed to the success of our country . We need to take bold action to make sure that we educate and train our American people to be the best scientists they can be . But that does n't mean that every smart person who loves America was born in America . In fact , some of the most patriotic people I have ever met were immigrants who came here and became Americans by choice . It is absolutely clear that nations that attract and retain highly- skilled innovators gain a competitive advantage , and we can help do that for America through this very thoughtful plan . For us , the promise of the American Dream remains a powerful draw for the world 's innovators . This amendment would move us in the right direction and help ensure that America , and not our competitors , benefits from the world 's best minds . I want to thank Mr. Langevin for this smart amendment , and I urge its adoption . Mr. TIFFANY . Mr. Speaker , so once again , we hear that this will be a small number of people that are coming in . All we have to do is look at our southern border and other places for hearing about how small numbers of people are going to come into our country . We also hear , trust the Secretary of Defense . As I cited in my opening remarks , we had a real problem with the MAVNI program , where the Obama administration discovered Chinese spies in our military . This is a serious , serious situation . And here is the thing that I find frustrating , Mr. Speaker . We have so many people that project our freedoms and how we view them on other countries , including China , that they treat their people the same way . They simply do not , and it is fully proven that the Chinese Communist Party demands complete fealty of anyone , whether they are in China , or they come to our country to go back and give all information to the Chinese Communist Party . They do not protect intellectual property rights , which are a foundation of our freedoms here in America . We should not be sanguine about what this amendment will do . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. LANGEVIN . Mr. Speaker , I have no further speakers so I am prepared to close . I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. TIFFANY . Mr. Speaker , I yield back the balance of my time . Mr. LANGEVIN . Mr. Speaker , let me just say that when the Secretary of Defense deems it vital to the national security interests of the United States , this would give that authority to grant this special pathway to the Secretary to make that determination . A special immigrant visa , by the way , to streamline the admission of applicants in the name of national security is not new . My amendment is modeled after a 1949 law granting the Director of the CIA the authority to obtain permanent residency for anyone deemed `` in the interest of national security or essential to the furtherance of national intelligence missions . '' Today , the Secretary of Defense has no mechanism for retaining top technical and scientific talent who are vital to national security . Unsurprisingly , the Department of Defense explicitly endorses the amendment . So , again , my amendment is not new or groundbreaking to the immigration conversation . In fact , again , it provides the Secretary of Defense with the same authority that the Director of the CIA has enjoyed since 1949 . This authority is not challenged as a less strident or reckless method that our adversaries exploit because it does not circumvent the current immigration process . All the Secretary of Defense innovation referrals are subject to the same rigorous and extensive background checks that any other applicant receives . I am confident that they will properly vet these applicants as we will keep the best talent in the world working on our behalf . I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment to ensure our continued military and technological superiority . Mr. Speaker , I yield back the balance of my time . Ms. JOHNSON of Texas . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of the amendment . International students and researchers provide enormous benefits for American competitiveness and prosperity . As of 2018 , immigrants founded 50 of the 91 privately held billion-dollar startup tech companies in the United States . A quarter of those founders came to the U.S. as international students . These companies created an average of 1,200 jobs each , and have a collective value of $ 250 billion . International students and researchers bring fresh perspectives , diverse experiences , expertise , energy , and creativity to the U.S. research enterprise . The global competition to attract top science , technology , engineering , mathematics , and medical talent is intensifying . And attracting talent is just half the battle . Restrictive immigration policies and xenophobic rhetoric , restrictions due to the pandemic , and concerted efforts by other countries to attract talent , have given talented international STEM students good reason to consider opportunities outside of the U.S. We must take bold action now to ensure the U.S. can continue to attract and retain global STEM talent . This amendment creates a new pathway to permanent residency for a small number of outstanding students and professionals engaged in critical fields that are vital to achieving the goals of the National Defense Strategy and National Defense Science and Technology Strategy . While modest in scope , the amendment would help advance areas of innovation that are critical to our national security and economic competitiveness . I urge my colleagues to support this amendment .

      "Mr. LANGEVIN . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . Mr. Speaker , the United States attracts and develops some of the brightest minds in the world . They can fortify national security and boost economic competitiveness . Unfortunately , much of that talent leaves because there are few options to remain . My amendment provides a pathway to citizenship for the best foreign talent to work in the U.S. in support of our National Security Innovation Base . Great power competition is a race for talent to maintain our military and technological superiority . We want the brightest minds in the world working for us , not the Chinese Communist Party . The U.S. has less than 5 percent of world 's population , so it is no surprise that many great scientific minds are born outside U.S. borders . So then how have we maintained our technological superiority over the last 70 years , by way of example ? Well , our world-class universities and innovative private sector attract future Nobel laureates in critical technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence . However , our constricted pathways to residency and citizenship drive this talent into the arms of our adversaries ; so we face intense competition from other countries who offer large research grants and expedited citizenship to lure this talent away . But it is not just potential adversaries . Some U.S. companies are setting up R & D facilities in Canada because their immigration policies more effectively attract highly-skilled workers . Under this amendment , the Secretary of Defense will implement a competitive annual process to select scientists with technical expertise in critical technologies and recommend them for proper processing and vetting . It is in our national security interests not only to have these scientists working on research on our behalf , but also to prevent this talent from working for our adversaries . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. TIFFANY . Mr. Speaker , I rise in opposition to the amendment . The SPEAKER pro tempore . The gentleman from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 minutes . Mr. TIFFANY . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . The ramifications of this amendment could be dangerous and far- reaching . Quite frankly , we should not be looking outside of the United States for such scientists and researchers . We should cultivate our own talent . Unfortunately , this bill does nothing to develop that talent . We must ask , which foreign nationals would be eligible for the program ? Most likely , those from China . China is so intent on using our U.S. immigration system to steal our sensitive technologies that the Trump administration had to issue a proclamation suspending entry of certain Chinese students and researchers . The Trump administration proclamation stated : `` The People 's Republic of China is engaged in a wide-ranging and heavily resourced campaign to acquire sensitive United States technologies . . . to bolster the modernization and capability of its military . '' The proclamation went on to state that `` students or researchers from the PRC studying beyond the undergraduate level . . . are at high risk of being exploited or co-opted by the PRC . '' Because of the brutal nature of the Chinese Communist Party , the same is true for virtually any Chinese national who comes to the United States to study or research , or to otherwise work in sensitive technologies like those contemplated under this amendment . In fact , the Department of Homeland Security told us last year that the Chinese government requires its nationals to `` support , assist , and cooperate with State intelligence work . '' The idea for this amendment came , at least in part , from the Commission on Artificial Intelligence , which called for `` increasing China brain drain . '' So clearly , the green cards contemplated under this amendment would go to Chinese nationals . The last thing we should do is make it easy for the Chinese Communist Party to gain access to our National Security Innovation Base work , Department of Defense research , or other critical technologies . I would also note that , sadly , the Department of Defense does not have a great track record regarding immigrant programs . Many of you may remember that the Department of Defense supported and encouraged the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest program through which foreign nationals were able to enlist in the U.S. military . Once enlisted , they were eligible to naturalize . The Department of Defense was not living up to its promise to adequately vet and perform high-level background checks on the MAVNI participants . The program was halted by the Obama administration when it was discovered that the Department had allowed some Chinese spies to enlist in the military . Let that sink in . The Department of Defense let Chinese spies enlist in the U.S. military . So I am not comfortable with several aspects of the program created by this amendment . I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. LANGEVIN . Mr. Speaker , how much time do I have remaining ? The SPEAKER pro tempore . The gentleman from Rhode Island has 3 minutes remaining . The gentleman from Wisconsin has 2 minutes remaining . [ [ Page H4956 ] ] Mr. LANGEVIN . Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from California ( Ms. Lofgren ) . Ms. LOFGREN . Mr. Speaker , I thank the gentleman for yielding . Mr. Speaker , I rise in strong support of this amendment that would allow a small number of special immigrant visas to the world 's top scientists and technical experts selected by the Secretary of Defense . I trust the Secretary of Defense looking out after the Nation 's security interests , and it is important that our security depends on having access to the top scientists in the world who are committed to the success of our country . We need to take bold action to make sure that we educate and train our American people to be the best scientists they can be . But that does n't mean that every smart person who loves America was born in America . In fact , some of the most patriotic people I have ever met were immigrants who came here and became Americans by choice . It is absolutely clear that nations that attract and retain highly- skilled innovators gain a competitive advantage , and we can help do that for America through this very thoughtful plan . For us , the promise of the American Dream remains a powerful draw for the world 's innovators . This amendment would move us in the right direction and help ensure that America , and not our competitors , benefits from the world 's best minds . I want to thank Mr. Langevin for this smart amendment , and I urge its adoption . Mr. TIFFANY . Mr. Speaker , so once again , we hear that this will be a small number of people that are coming in . All we have to do is look at our southern border and other places for hearing about how small numbers of people are going to come into our country . We also hear , trust the Secretary of Defense . As I cited in my opening remarks , we had a real problem with the MAVNI program , where the Obama administration discovered Chinese spies in our military . This is a serious , serious situation . And here is the thing that I find frustrating , Mr. Speaker . We have so many people that project our freedoms and how we view them on other countries , including China , that they treat their people the same way . They simply do not , and it is fully proven that the Chinese Communist Party demands complete fealty of anyone , whether they are in China , or they come to our country to go back and give all information to the Chinese Communist Party . They do not protect intellectual property rights , which are a foundation of our freedoms here in America . We should not be sanguine about what this amendment will do . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. LANGEVIN . Mr. Speaker , I have no further speakers so I am prepared to close . I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. TIFFANY . Mr. Speaker , I yield back the balance of my time . Mr. LANGEVIN . Mr. Speaker , let me just say that when the Secretary of Defense deems it vital to the national security interests of the United States , this would give that authority to grant this special pathway to the Secretary to make that determination . A special immigrant visa , by the way , to streamline the admission of applicants in the name of national security is not new . My amendment is modeled after a 1949 law granting the Director of the CIA the authority to obtain permanent residency for anyone deemed `` in the interest of national security or essential to the furtherance of national intelligence missions . '' Today , the Secretary of Defense has no mechanism for retaining top technical and scientific talent who are vital to national security . Unsurprisingly , the Department of Defense explicitly endorses the amendment . So , again , my amendment is not new or groundbreaking to the immigration conversation . In fact , again , it provides the Secretary of Defense with the same authority that the Director of the CIA has enjoyed since 1949 . This authority is not challenged as a less strident or reckless method that our adversaries exploit because it does not circumvent the current immigration process . All the Secretary of Defense innovation referrals are subject to the same rigorous and extensive background checks that any other applicant receives . I am confident that they will properly vet these applicants as we will keep the best talent in the world working on our behalf . I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment to ensure our continued military and technological superiority . Mr. Speaker , I yield back the balance of my time . Ms. JOHNSON of Texas . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of the amendment . International students and researchers provide enormous benefits for American competitiveness and prosperity . As of 2018 , immigrants founded 50 of the 91 privately held billion-dollar startup tech companies in the United States . A quarter of those founders came to the U.S. as international students . These companies created an average of 1,200 jobs each , and have a collective value of $ 250 billion . International students and researchers bring fresh perspectives , diverse experiences , expertise , energy , and creativity to the U.S. research enterprise . The global competition to attract top science , technology , engineering , mathematics , and medical talent is intensifying . And attracting talent is just half the battle . Restrictive immigration policies and xenophobic rhetoric , restrictions due to the pandemic , and concerted efforts by other countries to attract talent , have given talented international STEM students good reason to consider opportunities outside of the U.S. We must take bold action now to ensure the U.S. can continue to attract and retain global STEM talent . This amendment creates a new pathway to permanent residency for a small number of outstanding students and professionals engaged in critical fields that are vital to achieving the goals of the National Defense Strategy and National Defense Science and Technology Strategy . While modest in scope , the amendment would help advance areas of innovation that are critical to our national security and economic competitiveness . I urge my colleagues to support this amendment . Mr. LANGEVIN . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of the en bloc package , which contains amendment No . 384 to create four critical technology security centers . These centers would be created through competitive grants issued by the Department of Homeland Security to universities or federally funded research and development centers , including national laboratories . Each center would have a different focus , with the first four covering network technology , network industrial control systems , open source software , and Federal critical software , respectively . Each center would rigorously test the security of a set of technologies developed with input from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency , or CISA , the compromise of which would represent the highest level of risk to our critical infrastructure . With respect to those specific technologies , centers would evaluate their overall security posture ; develop new tools and capabilities for vulnerability discovery , management , and mitigation ; and support the remediation of the vulnerabilities they find . This is an important recommendation of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission , and I thank my fellow Commissioner , Mr. Gallagher , for cosponsoring this amendment . I also thank Chairman Thompson for his support of the measure . I urge Members to support the en bloc package and the underlying bill . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Mr. Speaker , I yield myself such time as I may consume . Mr. Speaker , this en bloc package was put together in close consultation with the minority . I urge all Members to support it . Mr. Speaker , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Mr. Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas ( Ms. Jackson Lee ) . Ms. JACKSON LEE . Mr. Speaker , I thank the chairman , and I thank the ranking member for his support , longtime friends . Let me quickly indicate that as I have embraced the NDAA over the years , it has always been my focus to deal with the military personnel and to make us the best , the strongest , and the most well respected and appreciated . I want to thank this committee and the Rules Committee for allowing my amendments Nos . 191 , 192 , 193 , 194 , 195 , 196 , 197 , and 198 . Many of them speak for themselves . Let me clearly say that I have worked year after year as a breast cancer survivor to ensure that triple-negative breast cancer , which is one of the most deadly forms of cancer -- that women in the military have the services that they need . Let me just share with you that triple-negative breast cancer has a survival rate of 5 years . The key to beating this cancer is early detection . There is $ 10 million to enhance research and to help these women . In addition , I have asked for $ 2 million for post-traumatic stress disorder . I even , under then-Colonel Murtha , organized a center in my district . But the most important point for supporting this amendment is that it still exists -- Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom , 11 to 20 out of 100 ; Gulf war , 12 out of 100 ; Vietnam war , 30 out of 100 . It is still needed , and we appreciate this amendment . I also want to thank you for recognizing that we are going into space . My amendment says that we should have a bill that studies the risks proposed by man-made space debris in lower orbit , including recommendations and remediation of such risks . It is extremely important . Finally , I want to speak to a very important amendment dealing with the longstanding history of African Americans in the United States military , to create a task force that respects the fact that Crispus Attucks , a runaway slave who escaped -- during the Boston Massacre to the present day -- an escaped slave who fought in the Revolutionary War with George Washington . This story is a long-story story . The United States Army and others have a very long history . This task force will determine the impact of slavery and the impact of our soldiers from the very early years , who happened to be ex-slaves fighting all the way through the many different wars . I believe we will find that those who are descendants of enslaved Africans have fought in wars from the very beginning . It is an important story . It should be told . I am very pleased that this particular amendment is included . The SPEAKER pro tempore . The time of the gentlewoman has expired . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Mr. Speaker , I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas ( Ms. Jackson Lee ) . Ms. JACKSON LEE . Mr. Speaker , I will just conclude that this task force , which will be a very significant historical study , will be very much appreciated . But let me quickly say that having worked with our various nominees to the military academies , one in particular was an individual who stuttered . By the time he finished , they said he could not have his command . They never assessed him in the academy while he was there . I believe this is an important assessment , to assess that vital $ 250,000 student , so that when he graduates , he will have a command even if he is a stutterer because he made it into the academy ; he was successful academically ; and he should be allowed to serve his country . I thank you for considering my amendments and for them to stay in to become law . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of my Amendments in the En Bloc Amendment No . 2 to H.R . 4350 , the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2022 , which incorporates Jackson Lee Amendments Nos . 191 , 192 , 193 , 194 , 195 , 196 , 197 , and 198 . I thank the Rules Committee for making these amendments in order . I also thank Chairman Smith of the House Armed Services Committee and his staff for working with me and my staff to include the Jackson Lee Amendments in this En Bloc , and for his great work in shepherding the bill to the floor . The amendments included in En Bloc No . 2 are as follows : 1 . Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No . 191 -- Provides authorization for a $ 10 million increase in funding for increased collaboration with NIH to combat Triple Negative Breast Cancer . 2 . Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No . 192 -- Provides authorization for $ 2.5 million increase in funding to combat posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . 3 . Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No . 193 -- Directs the Secretary of Defense to [ [ Page H4986 ] ] promulgate regulations to ensure that candidates granted admission to attend a military academy undergo screening for speech disorders and be provided the results of the screening test and a list of warfare unrestricted line ( URL ) Officer positions and occupation specialists that require successful performance on the speech test . Academy students shall have the option of undergoing speech therapy to reduce speech disorders or impediments . 4 . Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No . 194 recognizes that Black men and women have played an integral role in the defense of the nation from the bravery of Crispus Attucks , an escaped slave , during the Boston Massacre to the present day , and seeks to determine how to address the historical and current barriers to their participation and equal treatment in the Armed Services . 5 . Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No . 195 -- Requires report on Maternity Mortality Rates for military members and their dependents . 6 . Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No . 196 -- Requires a report to be submitted to Congress within 240 days following enactment on the risks posed by debris in low earth orbit and to make recommendations on remediation of risks and outline plans to reduce the incident of space debris . 7 . Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No . 197 -- Requires the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress programs and procedures employed to ensure students studying abroad through Department of Defense National Security Education Programs are trained to recognize , resist , and report against recruitment efforts by agents of foreign governments . 8 . Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No . 198 -- Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress within 180 days a report on the recognition of African Americans who have served in the Armed Forces in DOD naming practices and conventions for military installations , infrastructure , vessels , and weapon systems . Jackson Lee Amendment 191 provides authorization for a $ 10 million increase in funding for increased collaboration with NIH to combat Triple Negative Breast Cancer . As a Member of Congress , a mother , a sister , a spouse , and a breast cancer survivor , I feel a special responsibility to do all I can to ensure every American can win in the fight against all types of breast cancer but especially triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) . What is triple negative breast cancer ? The term triple negative breast cancer refers to the fact that this form of breast cancer will test negative , which means that each of the tests will return negative results for the presence of breast cancer for three types of breast cancer tests : Estrogen receptor ; Progesterone receptor ; and Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 or the HER2 test will be negative . In addition , triple-negative breast cancer : Tends to be more aggressive than other types of breast cancer ; Five-year survival rates also tend to be lower for triple-negative breast cancer ; and Triple Negative Breast Cancer tends to be higher grade than other types of breast cancer . Studies have shown that triple-negative breast cancer is more likely to spread beyond the breast and more likely to recur ( come back ) after treatment . For example , a study of more than 1,600 women in Canada published in 2007 found that women with triple-negative breast cancer were at higher risk of having the cancer recur outside the breast -- but only for the first 3 years . As years go by , the risks of the triple-negative breast cancer recurring become similar to those risk levels for other types of breast cancer . The key to beating this cancer is not just early detection -- but detection period . A 2007 study of more than 50,000 women with all stages of breast cancer found that 77 percent of women with triple-negative breast cancer survived at least 5 years , versus 93 percent of women with other types of breast cancer . Another study of more than 1,600 women published in 2007 found that women with triple-negative breast cancer had a higher risk of death within 5 years of diagnosis , but not after that time period . The recurrence and survival figures in these and other studies are averages for all women with triple-negative breast cancer . Factors such as the grade and stage of the breast cancer will influence an individual woman 's prognosis . About 15-20 percent of breast cancers are triple negative . Triple Negative tumors tend to occur more often in younger women and African-American women . In studies of U.S. and British women , triple negative breast cancer appears to be more common among black women ( especially before menopause ) compared to white women . Triple negative breast cancer may also be more common among Hispanic women compared to white women . Although the reasons for racial/ethnic differences in rates of triple negative breast cancer are not clear , lifestyle factors may play a role . For example , some findings show African-American women tend to have lower rates of breastfeeding compared to other women , which may increase the chances of having triple negative breast cancer . For these individuals and the tens of thousands of survivors and their daughters this amendment is needed . Jackson Lee Amendment 192 provides authorization for $ 2.5 million increase in funding to combat post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . PTSD was first brought to public attention in relation to war veterans , but it can result from a variety of traumatic incidents , such as torture , being kidnapped or held captive , bombings , or natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes . People with PTSD may startle easily , become emotionally numb ( especially in relation to people with whom they used to be close ) , lose interest in things they used to enjoy , have trouble feeling affectionate , be irritable , become more aggressive , or even become violent . They avoid situations that remind them of the original incident , and anniversaries of the incident are often very difficult . Most people with PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma in their thoughts during the day and in nightmares when they sleep . These are called flashbacks . A person having a flashback may lose touch with reality and believe that the traumatic incident is happening all over again . My amendment recognizes that these soldiers are , first and foremost , human . They carry their experiences with them . Ask a veteran of Vietnam , Iraq , or Afghanistan about the frequency of nightmares they experience , and one will realize that serving in the Armed Forces leaves a lasting impression , whether good or bad . According to the National Center for PTSD , the number of Veterans with PTSD varies by service era : Operations Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) and Enduring Freedom ( OEF ) : About 11- 20 out of every 100 Veterans ( or between 11-20 percent ) who served in OIF or OEF have PTSD in a given year . Gulf War ( Desert Storm ) : About 12 out of every 100 Gulf War Veterans ( or 12 percent ) have PTSD in a given year . Vietnam War : It is estimated that about 30 out of every 100 ( or 30 percent ) of Vietnam Veterans have had PTSD in their lifetime . Another cause of PTSD in the military can be military sexual trauma ( MST ) . This is any sexual harassment or sexual assault that occurs while you are in the military . MST can happen to both men and women and can occur during peacetime , training , or war . Among Veterans who use VA health care , about : 23 out of 100 women ( or 23 percent ) reported sexual assault when in the military . 55 out of 100 women ( or 55 percent ) and 38 out of 100 men ( or 38 percent ) have experienced sexual harassment when in the military . My amendment will help ensure that `` no soldier is left behind '' by addressing the urgent need for more outreach toward hard-to-reach veterans suffering from PTSD , especially those who are homeless or reside in underserved urban and rural areas of our country . Jackson Lee Amendment 194 recognizes that Black men and women have played an integral role in the defense of the nation , from the bravery of Crispus Attucks , an escaped slave , during the Boston Massacre to the present day , and seeks to determine how to address the historical and current barriers to their participation and equal treatment in the Armed Services . Black Americans became pilots , nurses , Marines , and West Point graduates , but it was not until President Harry S. Truman issued an executive order in 1948 that the armed services were integrated ; and even then , some units refused to do so for several more years . In 1777 , when George Washington faced a dearth of white soldiers willing to fight on behalf of the colonies , he allowed Black men to fight in the continental army and during the harsh winter of 1778 the Rhode Island Assembly , therefore , passed a law in 1778 allowing `` every able-bodied negro , mulatto , or Indian man slave in this state to enlist . '' 100 black soldiers signed up in exchange for their freedom . During the Civil War , around 179,000 Black men served in the Union army , either in the Army , Navy , or non-combat positions and more than 40,000 gave the last full measure of devotion to their country . Over 125,000 Black soldiers served overseas in the segregated military during World [ [ Page H4987 ] ] War II , but the U.S. military remained segregated . When Black veterans came home , many found it difficult to get housing or jobs because White veterans were given preference . The racial inequality and mistreatment of Black men and women that has historically permeated our military continues to this day , with more than 750 complaints of discrimination by race or ethnicity from service members in the fiscal year 2020 alone . But discrimination does n't exist just within the military rank-and- file , as in that same fiscal year , civilians working in the financial , technical , and support sectors of the Army , Air Force ; and Navy also filed 900 complaints of racial discrimination and over 350 complaints of discrimination by skin color , data from the U.S . Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shows . According to a report by the Defense Department 's Diversity and Inclusion Board , while the enlisted ranks of the active and reserve military were `` slightly more racially and ethnically diverse than its U.S. civilian counterparts , '' the opposite was true for the officer corps . With the rise and normalization of white supremacist expression during the Trump administration , the concept of restorative justice has gained more urgency , garnering the attention of mainstream commentators , and illustrating the need for a national reckoning . We owe it to those brave men and women who have proven time and time again to be an integral part of our military to examine the Armed Services ' history of discrimination and to determine the necessary steps to repair the harm caused by these inequities . Jackson Lee Amendment No . 96 directs that the Secretary of DoD provide a report 240 days from enactment of this bill on the risks posed by man-made space debris in low-earth orbit , including recommendations on remediation of such risks , and outlines of plans to reduce the incident of space debris . Space debris encompasses both natural and artificial particles . This Jackson Lee Amendment would address the risk of man-made space debris . Man-made objects in Earth 's orbit that may no longer serve a useful function can include nonfunctional spacecraft , abandoned launch vehicle stages , mission-related debris and fragmentation debris . Space debris travels at speeds up to 17,500 miles per hour is fast enough for a small piece of man-made debris to damage a satellite or a spacecraft . There are more than 20,000 pieces of debris larger than a softball orbiting the Earth . There are 500,000 pieces of debris the size of a marble or larger . There are many millions of pieces of debris that are so small they ca n't be tracked . NASA tracks more than 500,000 pieces of man-made space debris in Earth 's orbit . This amendment seeks a report from the Secretary of Defense on the risks posed by man-made space debris , solutions for reducing risks and strategies for reducing the incidence of more man-made space debris being introduced into space . I urge all members to vote for En Bloc Amendment No . 2 and the underlying legislation , H.R . 4350 , the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2022 { time } 1745 Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Mr. Speaker , I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas ( Mr. Gohmert ) , my longtime friend and colleague . Mr. GOHMERT . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of amendment 165 . It creates a separate career track for military judges to prevent undue influence from command above . In the 1970s it was seen that it would be good for trial defense attorneys to have a separate track so that they were not rated by the same person who was pushing to have a court martial . That created some problems and at times some abuses . The separation and the creation of a trial defense service served a great purpose , but before 2004 each of the judge advocates general of the armed services subscribed to the policy that all judge advocates should have a broad career and move from job to job . They became quite good at all trades but masters of none . So junior judge advocates would try a few court martials , then move from one job to another . It gave them a broad basis , but it was not helpful overall . By giving the military judges a separate career track , it will ensure avoidance of undue command influence and will give our servicemembers the fair trials they deserve . I would encourage everyone to vote for this amendment . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Mr. Speaker , I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Illinois ( Mr. Krishnamoorthi ) . Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI . Mr. Speaker , I urge support of my amendment , which would permit the Secretary of HHS to receive unused and oftentimes just about to expire COVID vaccines from States and be able to redistribute them to foreign partners or allies . Now , my primary legislation before the body in Congress is called NOVID . It is a play on words , no more COVID . And this legislation would actually establish a program to help vaccinate 60 percent of the population of the world 's 92 poorest countries . I hope that this legislation is taken up by this body and supported by the administration . In the meantime , the very least that we can do is to donate unused vaccines from the States . Now , these vaccines are about to expire . They are going to be no good in just a matter of months , and so instead of allowing them to go to waste , we should donate them abroad . This is not only the right thing to do to help to end suffering abroad , but it is the smart thing to do because then it helps to prevent variants that are generated abroad from coming back home to the United States and further wreaking havoc on our economy . On top of that , we see the Chinese Communist Party going around the world peddling their ineffective Sinovac vaccine , and we should be instead vaccinating those populations with effective vaccines . Again , I hope that the administration utilizes this amendment to great impact , and I hope that they also do more and endorse my NOVID legislation . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Mr. Speaker , I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas ( Mr. Jackson ) , an outstanding freshman member of the Armed Services Committee . Mr. JACKSON . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of my amendment , which clearly states that Israel is a critical defense partner of ours . Our national security is inextricably linked to our relationship with and our military 's support for Israel . As our strongest ally in the Middle East , it is critical that we conduct military exercises with Israel to improve interoperability and readiness . We must ensure that Israel has the capabilities it needs to defend itself against terrorists with consistent and reliable transfers of defense articles . Last year , President Trump negotiated the historic Abraham Accords , and to honor that , my amendment states clear support for Israel 's work to promote peace . While some in this body have made their disdain for the Jewish State of Israel clear , I believe our relationship with Israel is nonnegotiable . Our friends in Israel are currently questioning our commitment because some of my more radical colleagues forced the Speaker to withdraw financial support for the Iron Dome yesterday . I urge all Members of this body to support my amendment . We must take this step to show the only democracy in the Middle East that they can count on us for support . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Mr. Speaker , I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illinois ( Ms. Kelly ) . Ms. KELLY of Illinois . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of en bloc No . 2 , which includes three amendments I worked on . Amendment No . 217 establishes a pilot transition assistance program for military spouses , offering similar services to those available for members of our Armed Forces . This includes mental health first aid training since military spouses are well positioned to notice warning signs for any mental health or subsequent abuse struggles a new veteran might experience . Amendment No . 218 will improve interagency communication as the low Earth orbit becomes more crowded with defense , civil , and commercial space assets . Finally , amendment No . 158 with Representative Gonzales will create a National Digital Reserve Corps to bring private sector talent into the Federal Government to work on short-term projects . We need more cybersecurity , artificial intelligence , and developer expertise in the Federal Government if we are going to meet the challenges of the 21st century . I urge my colleagues to support this en bloc . [ [ Page H4988 ] ] Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Mr. Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California ( Mr. Garcia ) , an outstanding freshman member of our Conference . Mr. GARCIA of California . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of my critical , bipartisan , bicameral bill , the Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act , which was included as an amendment in this en bloc package . My amendment would support military families by allowing military spouses with valid professional licenses in one State reciprocity in another State where their spouse is stationed on military orders . This effectively allows the spouse to cross-deck their professional license to another State while their spouse is on Active Duty . More than 30 percent of our military spouses work in a field requiring professional licensing , and when these families receive move orders to a new State , military spouses often must spend time and money to reapply for a professional license that they already have . On average , military families lose thousands of dollars per move in lost wages and fees caused by relicensing barriers , and in many cases the spouse ends up not even applying for the license because it takes too long or is too costly to do so . The struggle often threatens the economic security and quality of life for these families , as their loved ones serve our Nation . No military spouse should have to decide between job security and being with their family . Military families already sacrifice so much in service to our great country , and we must work to protect these families . At a time in which our communities are also facing critical shortages of skilled professionals , like nurses and teachers , I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment that will drastically improve the quality of life for our military families as well as our communities . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Mr. Speaker , I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina ( Ms. Manning ) . Ms. MANNING . Mr. Speaker , I rise today in strong support of the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act , and I urge my colleagues to support the bill and my five amendments included in the bill . My State of North Carolina is home to eight military bases and more than 800,000 Active Duty military servicemembers and veterans . The NDAA will give these servicemembers a 2.7 percent pay raise and add a crucial level of accountability by taking the prosecution of sexual assault and other crimes out of the chain of command . I urge support for my amendment requiring the military to consider the benefits of using electric vehicles for students at military installations . Increased use of electric vehicles by our military will help accelerate our transition to clean energy and create good-paying jobs in districts like mine . This bill also includes my amendments to express concern about the safety of Afghan women and girls and to require the Secretary of Defense to appoint an official to assist the State Department with continued evacuations from Afghanistan . We must do better for the people who helped our troops . I urge my colleagues to support this act . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Mr. Speaker , I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico ( Miss Gonzalez-Colon ) . Miss GONZALEZ-COLON . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of my amendments that are included in this amendment en bloc number 2 for the National Defense Authorization Act . This bill includes three amendments that were submitted by my office that will directly benefit our Nation 's security and , of course , the people of Puerto Rico . The first one is amendment 162 , which authorizes research into the health effects of nearly 70 years of live fire training in the municipality of Vieques . As well , amendment 163 supports the Puerto Rico National Guard by prohibiting the retirement of the current landing craft ships , or the MAG boats , not only used in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2019 and that were used again in March of this year . The Puerto Rico National Guard has used these ships to provide lifesaving food , water , and other equipment to the U.S. Virgin Islands , Vieques , and Culebra after any natural disaster . We can not afford to retire these ships until they are replaced . Lastly , will be amendment 164 , which requires the Secretary of the Army to allocate a Modular Small Arms Range to Puerto Rico . This is to increase the readiness of the Armed Forces . Right now , Puerto Rico only has a single firearms range for the Department of Defense personnel . That means that there are numerous scheduling conflicts , and it decreases the mission readiness on the island . I think those amendments should be supported . I want to thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers ; I really appreciate all their good work on this NDAA . Included in this en bloc are numerous provisions for the people of Puerto Rico as a territory . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Mr. Speaker , I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Michigan ( Mrs. Lawrence ) . Mrs. LAWRENCE . Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of the FY22 NDAA . As the co-chair of the Democratic Women 's Caucus , I am proud to see two of my amendments , 238 and 239 , included as part of this en bloc . These amendments would help us understand the factors that influence women servicemembers to stay in or leave the military as well as to take action to improve mental health outcomes for pregnant veterans . Unfortunately , pregnant veterans have been found to be disproportionately impacted by mental health disorders and must be given adequate support to prevent childbirth complications . This language would encourage the VA to support the use of doulas for expectant mothers and increase access for doulas for pregnant veterans . This is a time we must come together in our support of the growing number of women in the military . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Mr. Speaker , I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arkansas ( Mr. Hill ) , my friend and an outstanding leader on the Financial Services Committee . Mr. HILL . Mr. Speaker , I thank the chairman of the committee and my ranking member for the world-class work on this NDAA package . This package contains two of my amendments . First , my bipartisan bill , H.R . 3146 , the SAVE Act , passed the House unanimously earlier this year , is included as an amendment . The SAVE Act builds on the good work of the Armed Services Committee to include important provisions to counter China by improving the U.S. supply chain independence and security . Secondly , this en bloc includes my amendment to require the creation of an interagency strategy within the United States Government to disrupt and dismantle the production and trafficking of the drug Captagon that is being produced by the Syrian regime led by Assad . { time } 1800 In addition to regularly committing war crimes against his own people , the Assad regime is now becoming a narco-state . The United States Government must do all it can to disrupt this industrial level of production of this drug currently taking place in Syria . I thank my friends for their support of these amendments , and I urge support of this en bloc . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Mr. Speaker , I have no further speakers , and I am prepared to close , therefore , I reserve the balance of my time . Mr. ROGERS of Alabama . Mr. Speaker , I urge support of the amendments en bloc , and I yield back the balance of my time . Mr. SMITH of Washington . Mr. Speaker , I urge support of the amendments en bloc , and I yield back the balance of my time . Miss GONZALEZ-COLON . Mr. Speaker , I rise in strong support of en bloc package number two for the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022 . This bill includes three amendments that were submitted by my office and will directly benefit the people of Puerto Rico and our Nation 's security . Amendment 162 requires the Secretary of Defense to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences for the purpose of investigating the health effects on the island Municipality of Vieques that may have been [ [ Page H4989 ] ] caused by toxic waste left after nearly 70 years of live fire training . This waste includes heavy metals like lead , cancer-causing fuel chemicals , and even depleted uranium . In some locations , areas are so contaminated that it is not safe for workers to collect samples . While there are numerous studies from different government agencies on this topic , including from the Centers for Disease Control and Government Accountability Office , much work remains to be done to further understand the consequences from this practice . I am proud to say that this legislation now builds upon existing research for this important topic . Amendment number 163 prohibits the Secretary of Defense from retiring the Landing Craft ships used by Puerto Rico 's Army National Guard until such time as an adequate replacement is provided . These ships delivered critical food , water , and other materials to Puerto Rico 's noncontiguous islands of Vieques and Culebra , as well as the US Virgin Islands , following the aftermath of Hurricane Maria . The landing craft ships were scheduled to be retired this year , however the adopted amendment prohibits this decommissioning until replacement equipment arrives to Puerto Rico . My third and last amendment , number 164 , requires the Secretary of the Army to allocate a Modular Small Arms Range to Puerto Rico . Currently , Puerto Rico only has a single firearms range for Department of Defense personnel . This creates numerous scheduling conflicts and decreases mission readiness . Puerto Rico 's own Fort Buchanan has the capacity to support a Modular Small Arms Range . My office has met with both Army leaders who support this request . Let me close by noting that H.R . 4350 includes funding over 12 million dollars in funding for Fort Allen and 10 million for the Ramey Unit School , under the energy resilience and conservation program . Finally , H.R . 4350 includes 14 million under military construction for Fort Buchanan in Puerto Rico . I am appreciative of the Armed Service committees work and I look forward to seeing these projects to completion . I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of en bloc number two . "

      "Mr. TUBERVILLE . Madam President , after being in Washington , DC , for 10 months , I have seen this town jump from one issue to another . Sadly , many of the issues we face are self-inflicted -- illegal immigrants on the southern border , Americans who remain trapped in Afghanistan , and rampant inflation , just to name three . But we face a more serious threat in this Nation , an issue larger than left or right , a threat that goes beyond conservative and liberal -- China . China seeks to shackle the United States economically , technologically , and militarily . The Communist leaders of China are employing every instrument of national power to diminish our standing and influence in the world . Last month , President Biden told world leaders during his maiden U.N. General Assembly speech that the United States `` is not seeking a cold war . '' Well , the United States may not be seeking out a new Cold War , but China is , so we should n't give them the shovel to bury us . When asked this week if China 's hypersonic missile testing over the summer was a surprise to U.S. officials , White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki joked that the Biden administration `` welcomes stiff competition . '' Businesses that are struggling under unfair competition from China did n't laugh at the Press Secretary 's joke . Intelligence analysts who watch week after week as China hacks its way to technological superiority know the competition is cheating . Military leaders who stand the watch for us worry that the United States public may be asleep at the wheel to this enormous threat . In 2001 , then-Senator Biden said : The United States welcomes the emergence of a prosperous integrated China on the global stage because we expect this is going to be a China that plays by the rules . President Biden , China is not playing by the rules . The Director of National Intelligence , Avril Haines , said the following in her Annual Threat Assessment : The Chinese Communist Party . . . will continue . . . to . . . undercut . . . the United States , drive wedges between Washington and its allies and partners , and foster . . . international norms that favor the authoritarian Chinese system . The four-star admiral in charge of our nuclear overwatch , ADM Charles Richard , warned the country that China 's growth and strategic nuclear capability was `` breathtaking . '' To those paying attention , we know that China seeks to play a very dangerous game -- a game they intend to win and a game they will win unless we stand united as a nation and work together to face this growing threat . So let 's take a look at the most recent breathtaking development . China recently conducted their ninth hypersonic missile test since 2014 -- their ninth . By the way , 2014 was when then-President Obama was forced to start investing in missile defense after he ended or slowed funding for several programs early in his first term . What was important about China 's most recent test , however , is that it showed off China 's advanced space capabilities . Hypersonic missiles are weapons that fly at more than five times the speed of sound , 3,800 miles per hour . They do n't follow a fixed trajectory ; their path is flexible and maneuverable . This is what makes them so hard to defend against . A recent congressional report on hypersonic weapons revealed that the United States will not have a defensive capability against hypersonic weapons until the mid-2020s at the earliest . Unlike our government , which , by the way , is wasting money on civilian climate corps and bailing out poorly run liberal blue States , China spends its resources on deadliness -- a new and larger navy , a modernized nuclear arsenal , advanced space assets , and artificial intelligence . Yes , China is moving ahead and investing in killing machines . Developing hypersonics is costly . The Pentagon noted as much recently , which is ironic given how little this administration has showed it cares about throwing trillions of dollars around on other programs not related to national security . China continues to outspend us on national security . In just the last 10 years , China 's defense spending has increased by $ 200 billion , while we , the United States of America , have decreased by $ 400 billion . That brings me to a very important point . Senator Schumer needs to bring up the National Defense Authorization Act for a vote here on the Senate floor . Every year since 1960 , we have passed the National Defense Authorization Act , better known as the NDAA . The NDAA is one of few bills that the House and Senate , Democrats and Republicans , work together on . That is because our military deserves it , and our national security depends on it . One of the most important items we agreed on this year in the NDAA was that our military needs more support . Earlier this year , President Biden sent Congress a laughable military budget . In a stunning referendum on the President 's disappointing and dangerous military budget , Democrats and Republicans on the Armed Services Committee came together to increase our military budget by $ 25 billion . You know , we can not ask our military to do more with less . We can not expect our military to defend new threats from our adversaries like China without the resources required to do the job . Republicans understand this . We have continuously fought to prioritize national security . Democrats on the Armed Services Committee also understand this . So I would like to ask [ [ Page S7331 ] ] a simple question : What are we waiting for ? The best way to thank our men and women in uniform for their service is to pass this bill . The best way to ensure our armed services have resources they need to defend our country against China is to pass this bill , especially in light of the news we have seen recently about China 's hypersonic missile testing . Earlier this year , as the Senate Armed Services Committee crafted the NDAA , I fought to prioritize robust funding authorization for high- energy lasers and hypersonic missile development . This investment accelerates the country 's timeline to a fully capable hypersonic missile while at the same time assisting our missile defense capabilities with tracking hypersonic , ballistic , and cruise missiles . This is an offensive and defensive approach . China is actively trying to outpace us , and keeping pace is not enough . To do that , we need to have sustained , strategic investment in our military . That is what the NDAA provides and why we need a vote on the Senate floor . So what does it say about Leader Schumer 's priorities that passing our military authorization is at the bottom of his list ? But investment in their military is not the only means by which China is seeking to get ahead . We have seen increased efforts by China to infiltrate our economy -- we have seen this -- to undermine our free market values , and to steal our international property . In a recent survey , a greater number of Americans said that China is more powerful economically than the United States . This is a reversal from 2 years ago when most Americans said the United States had the economic upper hand . When it comes to taking over the economic upper hand , China has no rules , and Chinese companies definitely do not play by ours . Our country has already seen Chinese companies , backed by the Chinese Communist Party , attempt to invest in and even take over companies . This grave national security threat will only grow if we allow China to invest in our critical industries . Our government has a process to investigate offers made by foreign companies and governments that want to acquire or invest in America . This process is designed to protect our national security . It is handled by a government entity called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States , better known as CFIUS . But if there is a loophole , communist China will try to slip through it . Our goal as Members of Congress should be to strengthen this vetting process . One way to do that is to add a permanent agricultural perspective to this committee , which is not on there as we speak . The COVID pandemic showed us just how important it is to have strong supply chains , especially when it comes to our food supply . Every American is supported by a safe and secure food supply . It is critical to our country 's prosperity . Not everyone thinks about food security in relation to national security , but they are linked . Global corporations have already become more involved with our domestic food supply and agricultural businesses . Recent data shows that 192,000 acres of farmland or forest in the United States of America are linked to Chinese ownership , including land used for farming , ranching , and forestry -- 192,000 acres here within our borders . That is why we need more transparency . Our food supply must remain secure from foreign governments like China that have no business being in the American economy and actively trying to harm our country . That is why I introduced a bill called the Foreign Adversary Risk Management , or FARM , Act , to put more protections in place for America 's agriculture industry . My bill will ensure that our agriculture industry has a permanent seat at the table of CFIUS , which reviews agriculture-related investments . As we speak , we do not have representation from the agriculture community . By adding agriculture supply chains as a covered transaction that CFIUS has to review , we can make sure food supply chains remain strong and free of damaging foreign government interference . Like China 's communist leaders , leftists in this country believe that when it comes to the economy , bureaucrats know best . They think raising the corporate rate to be higher than communist China 's will strengthen our economy . Nonsense . That is like standing in a bucket and trying to lift yourself by the handle . The far-left cheers for mandates , hyperregulation , and massive taxes . They sneer at your freedoms and are triggered by the American flag and our constitutional rights . Their way is not the way to combat China ; it is the way to become China . We all know China wants to overtake the United States as a superpower . But what makes the United States a superpower is not just our economic and military might ; we are a superpower for what our military is fighting to defend and to protect : our freedoms and our values and the American spirit of innovation and ingenuity , of hard work and grit . These values pose a direct threat to communist China . They are why China wants to surpass our country as the world 's No . 1 superpower . We need leadership that protects our national security and our economic security . It is the only way to combat the aggression that the Biden administration 's weakness has invited . I yield the floor . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The Senator from Texas . "

      "Mr. REED . Mr. President , I rise to discuss the fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act . Over the coming days , the Senate will consider this bill , which the Armed Services Committee passed by a broad bipartisan margin of 23 to 3 in July . I look forward to debating and improving this bill , as we all work toward ensuring our military has the right tools and capabilities to combat threats around the globe and keep Americans safe . First , I would like to acknowledge Ranking Member Inhofe , whose leadership on this committee and this body has been invaluable . His commitment to our men and women in uniform is unwavering , and he was instrumental in helping to produce this bipartisan legislation . As we debate the NDAA , we must keep in mind that the United States is engaged in a strategic competition with China and Russia . These near- peer rivals do not accept U.S. global leadership or the international norms that have helped keep the peace for the better part of a century . This strategic competition is likely to intensify due to shifts in the military balance of power and diverging views of governance . And it is unfolding amidst climate change and the emergence of highly disruptive technologies . The interconnected nature of these threats will drive how we transform our tools of national power to respond . The passage of the FY2022 NDAA will be a critical step in meeting the complex challenges before us . Turning to the specifics of this year 's Defense bill , the NDAA authorizes $ 740 billion for the Department of Defense and $ 27 billion for national security programs within the Department of Energy . For the first time in years , this legislation , like the President 's budget request , does not include a separate overseas contingency fund , or OCO , request . Any war-related costs are included in the base budget . This bill contains a number of important provisions that I would like to highlight . To begin , we have a duty to ensure that the United States can outcompete , deter , and prevail against near-peer rivals . The NDAA supports the Department of Defense in this endeavor by providing the resources needed by the combatant commanders to carry out the national defense strategy , or NDS . Every 4 years , the Department reports the NDS to outline the national security objectives of the administration . The 2018 NDS provided a framework , and the DOD will release a new strategy in the coming months . In this regard , this bill creates a commission on the national defense strategy for the forthcoming NDS in order to boost our military advantage . Last year , the Armed Service Committee created the Pacific Deterrence Initiative -- or PDI -- to better align DOD resources in support of military-to-military partnerships to address the challenges posed by China . This year 's bill extends and modifies the PDI and reiterates the committee 's intent to improve our force posture in the Indo-Pacific , to increase readiness and presence , and to build the capabilities of our partners and allies to counter these threats . Future investments under PDI should focus on military and nonmilitary infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region . This will assist in distributed military operations , and it will be more effective in countering predatory Chinese infrastructure development practices . The bill also requires the Secretary of Defense to provide recurring briefings on efforts to deter Chinese aggression and military coercion . It compels a briefing on the advisability and feasibility of increasing United States defense cooperation with Taiwan . It is important we help Taiwan improve its overall readiness and acquire asymmetric capabilities most likely to make the Chinese Government question their ability to take the island by force . I want to emphasize , however , that our Nation 's ability to deter China can not be based on military might alone . We must strengthen our network of allies and partners , which will be essential to any strategy for the Indo-Pacific region . We must also ensure that , as we shift our focus to the Indo-Pacific , we do not lose sight of priorities in other areas , like Europe . This year 's bill authorizes the continuation of the European Deterrence Initiative -- or the EDI -- recognizing the continued need to invest in support for our European allies and partners as we work toward the shared goal of deterring Russian aggression , addressing strategic competition , and mitigating shared security concerns , the most recent one being the amassing of Russian troops on the border of Ukraine . Turning to personnel , the key factor that makes the United States the greatest military power in the world is its people . We need to ensure that our uniformed personnel know every day how much we appreciate what they do and that we have their backs . Congress has done a good job in providing benefits to the military and their families , and this year 's Defense bill continues to do that . But our military is showing the strain of two decades of continuous deployments , and I am concerned that there has been a dangerous erosion of trust within the chain of command ; and issues such as racism , extremism , sexual harassment , and sexual assault have been allowed to fester and create friction and division . The Department of Defense is addressing those issues , but Congress must provide guidance and resources . To this end , the bill strengthens the All-Volunteer Force and improves the quality of life of the men and women of the total force : the Active Duty , the National Guard , and the Reserves ; their families ; and , importantly , the Department of Defense civilian employees , who contribute significantly to the effectiveness of our operations . It reinforces the principles of a strong , diverse , inclusive force and that force cohesion requires a command climate that does not tolerate extremism or sexual assault misconduct or racism ; and that quality healthcare is a fundamental necessity for servicemembers and their families . Importantly , this NDAA includes the funding necessary to support a 2.7 percent pay raise for both military servicemembers and the DOD civilian workforce . We have also included a provision that would amend the Military Selective Service Act to require the registration of women for Selective Service . I am proud of this position , which passed the Armed Services Committee on a broad bipartisan basis . Society , the military , and the nature of warfare itself have evolved significantly since the 1948 Military Selective Service Act passed . Back then , women were denied the opportunity to serve in [ [ Page S8412 ] ] combat roles and key leadership positions , and entire technologies and platforms did n't even exist . Today , all military occupations , including combat roles , are open to women , and military success depends heavily on servicemembers with advanced education and technical skills in STEM , cyber , medicine , languages , and more . To be clear , I am hopeful that we will never have to draft again . If we do , however , it will be under circumstances so dire and existential that to voluntarily choose to enter the fight with anything less than our very best would be supremely foolish and potentially fatal . If we are going to have a Selective Service System , women must be a part of it . Basic equality and military readiness demand parity between the sexes to protect our country and uphold our values . In the meantime , it is time to end outdated sex discrimination and remove it from official policy and Federal law . The bill also creates a new category of bereavement leave for military personnel that would permit servicemembers to take up to 2 weeks of leave in connection with the death of a spouse or a child . Similarly , in an effort to provide greater care and support to our military men and women , it increases parental leave to 12 weeks for all servicemembers for the birth , adoption , or foster care placement of a child . It establishes a basic needs allowance to ensure that all servicemembers can meet the basic needs of their families , and it requires parity and special and incentive pays for members of the Reserve and the active components . In addition , I am proud that this bill makes historic changes to the military justice system to combat and discourage sexual assault and related misconduct within the military . Sexual assault is an unconscionable crime and a pervasive problem in the U.S. military and American society writ large . When it comes to the military , one of the basic ethics is that one must protect your comrades and your subordinates ; one can not exploit them . Sexual assault and sexual harassment is an example of unconscionable exploitation , and it must be eliminated . We must take comprehensive action to halt sexual misconduct , hold offenders accountable , and support survivors . While the military has tried to stop sexual assault in the ranks , it simply has n't been enough . I commend President Biden , the Department of Defense , and the Independent Review Commission for their work on proposals , which we have considered during our markup and which are reflected in the bill . We will continue to work with the administration and the House to move toward enacting this momentous change . Turning now to the areas of air , land , and sea power , with respect to our services , we have taken steps to improve their capabilities , their readiness , and their ability to fight and win . This bill makes significant efforts to improve the readiness of the Navy and Marine Corps aircraft , ships , and weapons systems . It provides considerable investments in our next-generation Arleigh Burke-class destroyers , including an increase of $ 1.7 billion to restore a second guided missile destroyer to this year 's budget and $ 125 million for long lead material for our destroyer in fiscal year 2023 . The bill authorizes $ 4.8 billion for the Columbia-class submarine program and for industrial-based development and expansion in support of the Virginia and Columbia shipbuilding programs , an increase of $ 130 million . I was up at Quonset Point , RI , recently , where all submarines start their construction . Along with the Deputy Secretary of Defense , Secretary Hicks , we saw the progress that we are making to build two Virginia-class submarines a year and turning out the first Columbia- class ballistic missile ship to replace the Ohio class . We are moving forward . And , frankly , many believe -- as I do -- that undersea strength is the best form of deterrence that we have . And as we deploy more submarines , we will have a greater ability to deter potential conflict . This bill also increases the Landing Helicopter Assault replacement funding by $ 350 million and the Expeditionary Fast Transport vessel program by $ 270 million . Growing our surface and undersea warfare capabilities will be vital to our success in the Indo-Pacific region , and this NDAA makes important progress in this area . It is consistent with our defense strategy of shifting our focus to the Pacific , which requires a shift of resources to the Navy and Marine Corps . Similarly , the bill authorizes funding to strengthen naval aviation , including five additional F-35 fighter variants , one additional E-2D Hawkeye aircraft , two additional C-130J Hercules aircraft , an additional KC-130J tanker , two additional CH-53K helicopters , and two MQ-4C Triton unmanned aerial systems . Now , with respect to the Air Force , the bill increases authorization funding by providing an additional F-35A fighter , five additional F-15 fighters , and extensions on the minimal capacity of several Air Force platforms . With respect to the Army , I am pleased that the bill advances research and development in important future technologies and makes broad investments in generational Army modernization efforts and continues to upgrade significant enduring capabilities . Our bill focuses on filling critical deficiencies and increasing investments in rapidly evolving demands . Further , it funds rapid development and fielding of land-based , long-range fires , including the precision strike missile , medium-range capability , and long-range hypersonic weapons . It also provides funding for future long-range assault aircraft and future attack reconnaissance aircraft , increased funding for the future tactical unmanned aircraft system , and authorizes full funding for the AH-64 Apache attack helicopters and the UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters . We are at a critical junction in a technological race with our near- peer competitors . We have enjoyed a technological lead over the last many decades . That lead is shrinking , and we have to not only develop the best of new technologies ; we have to get them in the hands of our troops as quickly as possible . And that is what we are trying to do in this legislation . Again , the issue is deterrence first , and what will help deter any conflict will be the realization of our adversaries that they are going up against the most sophisticated , technologically capable military in the world , manned by the most dedicated and skillful women and men in the world . That is what we are hoping to encourage . Likewise , with respect to the Army , the bill supports the modernization of its ground combat vehicles , including the M1 Abrams tanks , Bradley Fighting Vehicles , Paladin self-propelled howitzer , tactical-type vehicles . Having the platforms and the personnel is critical , but they have got to be ready to go , and we have taken great pride in trying to improve the readiness of our forces . This NDAA authorizes more than $ 2.8 billion for additional military construction projects after funding other large projects in the budget request . This bill also includes a number of provisions that will help acquisition outcomes by strengthening the ability of DOD to analyze the defense industrial base , evaluate acquisition programs , and implement acquisition reform efforts . It also streamlines processes to allow the Pentagon to invest in and incorporate advanced commercial technologies to support defense missions and strengthen DOD small business programs to allow partnerships with innovative , high-tech companies . From post-World War II until very recently , we were really in an industrial age , and the United States led the world . We have now moved to a post-industrial age where the new technologies , the new innovations are n't coming out of government labs or the Bell Labs ; they are coming out of small business ; they are coming out of young people who have come up with great ideas . And what we want to do and what we want to empower the Department of Defense to do is to be able to get those ideas , develop them , and incorporate them rapidly into our military forces . That means we have to develop partnerships with small business and think in a different way . We have to think about a more entrepreneurial acquisition system rather than `` this is the way we have always done it and are going to keep doing it . '' We also have another area that we have to pay attention to , and that is [ [ Page S8413 ] ] the area of the modernization of our nuclear triad . I recognize the concerns voiced by some of my colleagues about the cost of , and genuine disagreements about , our Nation 's nuclear policy . From my perspective , nuclear deterrence is the bedrock of our national defense . For our nuclear deterrent to be credible and to ensure these weapons never need to be used , they must be capable and ready for use . The deterrence that we have enjoyed for many , many decades has been gained by the acknowledgement by all other nuclear powers that we are more than capable to respond . Our allies and partners depend on the U.S. nuclear umbrella . That is one of the reasons why the proliferation which President Kennedy thought would be almost universal has not developed . And modernization of our strategic forces is necessary to ensure their dependability . One thing I think everyone agrees on , and I think often gets lost in the discussion , is another factor : arms control and modernization of our nuclear forces are inherently linked together . We must reinvigorate our efforts on arms control so that we do not have a situation where the proliferation issue becomes more obvious and more dangerous . So even as we modernize , we should seek ways to promote strategic stability , like the extension of the New START agreement and follow-on talks to cover new strategic weapons and further reduce nuclear stockpiles . The best way to reduce nuclear weapons is through negotiated mutual arms reductions rather than unilateral actions . That has been the history of the Cold War , which with the Soviets and the United States we were able , with every Presidency , to come up with some type of agreement . Unfortunately , we took , I think , a less aggressive posture in the last administration , but we have to renew significantly our arms control efforts and make them clear that it is mutual interest of Russia but also China because China is a growing nuclear power with a very deliberate plan to increase significantly their nuclear arsenals . We have to get a situation where there is at least a trilateral negotiation between the United States , China , and Russia for our own mutual benefit . And part of that is also not just looking at numbers but looking at the safeguards that each country places on the use of nuclear weapons . We do not want a situation where there is an accidental launch that triggers a catastrophic response . We have much to do . But I will emphasize again that simply rebuilding our triad without rebuilding our diplomacy is not the best path forward . What we have tried to do in this bill is to enhance deterrence through a number of factors , including recapitalizing the nuclear triad ; ensuring the safety and security and reliability of our nuclear stockpile , our delivery systems , and our infrastructure ; increasing capacity in theater and homeland missile defense ; and strengthening nonproliferation programs . We have -- particularly our land-based missile systems -- installations that were built in the 1960s . They are roughly 60 years old . They are showing wear and tear . And the delivery vehicles are also old . That is part of our modernization program . The Columbia class is the first of our new ballistic missile submarines . We have to replace the Ohio class because , frankly , that fleet will literally wear out . They wo n't be capable to go to sea at some point in the future . And that is why we are beginning right now . We are also looking at a new , sophisticated armor that will complement the other two legs of the triad . And because this involves the Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration , we authorized $ 20 billion for this effort . We have funded the Department of Energy 's other defense activities at $ 920 million and its nuclear energy activities at $ 149.8 million . This is all part of having an effective deterrence . Now , as we have seen , our adversaries are developing other capabilities at an alarming rate . With regard to hypersonics , it is especially clear that China is working to develop capabilities that evade current missile defense capabilities possessed by the United States and our allies . To address these threats , the bill authorizes the Missile Defense Agency to develop a highly reliable missile defense interceptor for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System . It also authorizes the procurement of the Iron Dome short-range rocket defense system , David 's Sling Weapon System , and Arrow 3 Upper Tier Interceptor Program to support our closest ally in the Middle East , Israel . There was a barrage emanating from Israel 's neighbors of approximately 4,500 missiles over the last year . And Iron Dome , which was created by the Israeli Government , knocked down a significant number of those missiles protecting the State of Israel . So this is not an academic exercise ; this is supporting a close ally . And it is also clear , as I mentioned before , China is expanding its nuclear weapons stockpile at a faster rate than we have seen from any other nation . It appears that China is seeking to at least reach parity with the United States and Russia in its efforts to become a world- class military . To respond to this and other countries ' proliferation efforts , the NDAA authorizes $ 239.84 million for Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs to stop the proliferation of nuclear , chemical , and biological threats around the world . If you take those three aspects -- improving our military capability , invigorating our diplomacy , and actively using Cooperative Threat Reduction -- to lower the ability and capability of those that have nuclear weapons , that is the best path ahead . Now , we have understood over the last several years that what is causing a great deal of destruction in this world in every aspect is technology , including cyber space activities . And we , again , are trying to hone and invigorate our technological innovation in this area . Innovation has long given us the strongest economy and military in the world . But it must be nurtured and maintained through careful investments and strong leadership in both the public and private sectors . I believe we have an advantage because we have such a great educational system , a great entrepreneurial system , the creativity and talent of the American people , but we have to focus on needs for our military and national priorities . And our top priority for Congress must be maintaining strong investments in technology areas that we know will shape future conflicts . This year 's NDAA includes multiple provisions to accelerate the modernization of the Department of Defense by investing in research and development of cutting-edge technologies and delivering them in a timely manner to the force . Specifically , it authorizes an increase of more than $ 1 billion for science and technology programs that fund cutting-edge research and prototyping activities at universities , small businesses , defense labs , and industry , including in critical areas such as artificial intelligence , microelectronics , advanced materials , 5G , and biotechnology . The bill also authorizes an increase of more than $ 500 million in funding for DARPA , the Defense Advanced Projects Agency . DARPA has been conducting high-risk , high-payoff research for years , including such areas as quantum computing and assisting with universities to accelerate their research . Importantly , the implements a number of recommendations from the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence , which the Armed Services Committee established in a previous NDAA . The $ 500 million of funding for DARPA will be extremely critical to the future and will produce , I think , some breakthrough technologies that not only DOD will use but will become commercial products for our national economy . And recognizing , again , the competition between the United States and China on certain militarily-relevant technologies , the bill strengthens the language of the CHIPS Act to ensure the national network for microelectronics research and development to support the development of world-leading domestic microelectronics technology and manufacturing capabilities . Now , I mentioned one of our problems is that we are moving from an industrial age , in which we were the dominant power in every dimension , to a new post-industrial age , where technological innovation has been distributed . Other countries , because of the [ [ Page S8414 ] ] nature of cyber and other technologies , are beginning to catch up with it and , in some cases , pass us . Often , and especially in the Department of Defense , one of our problems has been procurement and acquisition practices . The Department 's approach has been convoluted , poorly communicated , and burdened with inertia that makes partnering with private industry far too difficult . As America confronts threats around the globe that are evolving at unprecedented speeds , we must find a better way to identify our defense needs , communicate them , and deliver them in a timely manner . There are several areas that , if transformed , could allow DOD to more effectively do this . The fiscal year 2022 NDAA makes important progress by establishing an independent commission to review and assess the planning , programming , budgeting , and execution -- or PPBE -- process and identify areas for reform . The PPBE process has , for many decades , since the 1960s , given DOD leaders a way to evaluate the resources they need and to deliver them to the troops . However , as I mention consistently , it is a bit of a relic of the industrial age . It came in 1961 under Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara , the former chief executive of the Ford Company . And at that time , it was the most sophisticated way to manage resources and do research , but that was the height of the industrial age . We are now in a situation much different . So we need to modernize the procurement system and the acquisition system that we have in place . We have to make it more rapid , more agile , more capable of absorbing new products and getting them into the hands of the troops . So in addition to establishing this independent review commission , the NDAA requires the DOD Comptroller , along with the DOD 's Chief Information Officer and the Chief Data Officer , to submit a plan to consolidate the IT systems used to manage data and support the PPBE process . One of the things we have discovered is there is no really integrated data plan in the Department of Defense -- the largest Federal entity . There are multiple different brands of software systems , different brand of hardware . Some can talk to others , some ca n't . There is no successful company today that has such a , shall we say , slightly immature information processing system , and we have got to change it . Similarly , management transformation is badly needed with the Department . As I said , it is one of the largest bureaucracies in the world , and the Government Accountability Office has put the Pentagon 's approach to business management on its high-risk list , citing its vulnerability to waste , fraud , and abuse , inability to pass a financial audit , and a culture that remains resistant to change . To spur transformation , this NDAA requires the Secretary of Defense to improve Pentagon management by leveraging best practices and expertise from commercial industry , public administration , and business schools . I am confident these steps will allow us to leverage the best of American ingenuity and market talent that drives innovation . At the end of the day , we should think about management as a defense capability like any other . We hope we are opening up a new day of more efficient and sophisticated management , more integrated communication , and doing it in a way that will produce results that will get the best technology into the hands of our fighting men and women . One factor that we all are aware of every day is the challenge of cyber security . The cyber domain impacts everything we do , so there is absolutely no surprise that it has impacted the Defense Department and its industrial base . We need to ensure that our industrial base has improved cyber security , that they are not the back door through which our adversaries will use to enter and gain access to even more critical elements of our national security . As the recent SolarWinds , Microsoft Exchange Server , and Colonial Pipeline breaches painfully illustrated , traditional `` perimeter-based '' cyber defenses are simply inadequate to deal with sophisticated threats . Our adversaries are clearly advantaged in cyber domain and are likely to succeed in penetrating static defenses . Therefore , this NDAA requires the development of a joint `` zero trust '' cyber security strategy and a model architecture for the Department of Defense information network . It also authorizes an increase of $ 268.4 million across DOD to support cyber security efforts . We all recognize that cyber is a persistent threat to everything we do . As one very thoughtful gentleman said years ago at a function I was at , `` Breakthrough technology like cyber has two effects . It makes good things better and bad things worse . '' And that is exactly what we are witnessing every day . So we have to exploit the good things and get them into our system and be much more vigilant at protecting us from the bad things . Similarly , as the COVID crisis has made clear , we need a coordinated industrial policy to ensure that we have a robust , secure , and reliable technology and industrial base , especially in critical and emerging technology . We need to give the DOD the tools and expertise to understand its supply chain and its physical security challenges , its financial challenges , and influence from commercial market trends . To that end , this bill directs the Comptroller General to conduct a comprehensive assessment of research , development , test , and evaluation authorities and other similar authorities and brief Congress on its findings . The pandemic has shown many interesting things . Many companies and suppliers to our defense thought their products were coming from the United States , only to discover that critical components came from elsewhere and sometimes countries that were not particularly friendly to us . So we have to look seriously at our supply chain . Finally , while I spent most of my time speaking about future challenges and how we prepare the Department of Defense to face them , we can not lose sight of the events surrounding our withdrawal from Afghanistan . After nearly 20 years of war , enormous sacrifice by American and coalition military , diplomatic , and intelligence personnel and vast U.S. investment , the Afghan state has failed , and the Taliban has taken control . The Armed Services Committee has undertaken a series of hearings seeking to understand the collapse of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces . While there is temptation to close the book on Afghanistan and simply move on to long-term strategic competition with China and Russia , we must learn the lessons of the last two decades to ensure that our future counterterrorism efforts in Afghanistan or anyplace else continue to hold violent extremists at bay . The top-line defense number in this bill , together with the allocations set by Chairman Leahy for defense and nondefense funding across the 12 appropriations bills , provides a realistic balance for funding the military and the rest of the Federal Government . Once we have completed work on this important authorization bill , we need to complete the appropriations process . It would be a tremendous mistake and harmful for our national security , our economic prosperity , and our public health to resort to a continuing resolution to fund the government for an extensive period . I have calculated , roughly , that if we go into a yearlong continuing resolution , the Department of Defense will lose $ 36 billion , and the consequences of that would be staggering , particularly at this moment where we face challenges across the globe . We have near-peer competition with Russia and China , dangerous developments in East Africa , and situations across the board where we need to be ready to go looking at the threats , not looking internally at how we are going to pay to keep the lights on . Again , to avoid this self-inflicted damage , we have to pass a budget , as well as this authorization bill . Let me conclude by once again thanking Ranking Member Inhofe and my colleagues on the committee for working thoughtfully on a bipartisan basis to develop this important piece of legislation . I would also like to thank the staff who worked tirelessly on this bill throughout the year -- and tirelessly is an understatement . While we were leaving after our last vote , they were staying hours later to get this bill in shape to pass and then to begin our dialogue with the House . It is the staff of both sides . I salute my Republican [ [ Page S8415 ] ] colleagues ' staffers and my staffers for their job . I look forward to a thoughtful debate on the issues as we go forward . I yield the floor . I suggest the absence of a quorum . The PRESIDING OFFICER ( Mr. Schatz ) . The clerk will call the roll . The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll . Mr. INHOFE . Mr. President , I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded . The PRESIDING OFFICER . Without objection , it is so ordered . Mr. INHOFE . Mr. President , I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for such time as I shall consume . The PRESIDING OFFICER . Without objection , it is so ordered . Mr. INHOFE . First of all , this is a big deal , what we are embarking on now . It is something that -- people understand it is the most important thing we do around here . Let me just say that my partner Jack Reed and I have been doing this a long time . I have often said how fortunate I am . You know , we hear all year out there in the real world about how everybody hates everybody in Washington ; we want to compete with each other . But , you know , every year when we do the NDAA -- that means the National Defense Authorization Act -- it is the biggest and the most important bill of the year . Even though people think it is all happening inside this 2- or 3- day period , it is not . It is something that goes on all year long , and we have gotten to know each other very well . We know there are some areas where we have differences , but very rarely do we have differences that would impair our mission , and our mission is the most important mission that we have year-round . So I appreciate very much Chairman Reed , what he has been doing along with me , what we have done together . The NDAA has a long history of bipartisanship , and Senator Reed and I have worked together to get this bill through the committee with an overwhelming , bipartisan , 23-to-3 vote to bring it to the floor . That is where we are today . That is something you do n't hear about in Washington , that you can pass something out of a committee by a vote of 23 to 3 , but we did , and we did it because this is a bill that is done by the Members . The world is getting more dangerous by the day . We know that is the case . One notable example is what is happening now at the Ukraine border . Just weeks after conducting its largest military exercise in 40 years , Russia came dancing in , advancing a huge military buildup on the border . In fact , the Defense Minister from Ukraine was in my office this morning and was talking about all the things that are going on there . According to the image that we have by satellite , we are seeing tanks , we are seeing missiles , and we are seeing artillery . Here is why I am really concerned : We are seeing even military ambulances . Why would Putin be putting in military ambulances if he was not expecting casualties ? The answer is , he would n't . So we have an idea what is going to happen . In addition to this equipment , the experts are reporting that 90,000 Russian combat troops are amassed along Ukraine 's border . These troops are in a more threatening posture than they have ever been before . They are in the south and in the north . They are knocking on the door of Kyiv . All that is going on right now . It might sound crazy that Russia would want to deploy so many forces now in November to a region where the winters are brutally cold , but there is something not many people really think about ; that is , frozen ground is easier to move around heavy equipment like tanks and artillery . I am not the only one who is sounding the alarm on this . Earlier this year , Senator Rounds and Congressman Trent Kelly and I visited Romania , which , like Ukraine , sits on the frontlines of Russian aggression . At that time , Romanian military officials warned us that Russia was moving from a defensive to an offensive posture in the Black Sea . We are seeing that now . Everything we have predicted is happening now , and that assessment of the shift was actually right . Putin is capitalizing on what he perceives as U.S. weakness . He knows that our NATO allies are disturbed by the catastrophe in Afghanistan and that many of the European nations fear that the United States is no longer interested in trans-Atlantic security . The President should n't have done what he did , and we all -- I think most Americans know that . It was a disaster , the way he put this thing together in Afghanistan , and now we know where we are on this . It is tempting to say that we have seen this before , but I do n't think we have just like this . So this is about Americans , NATO , the credibility and the capability , and that is why the NDAA is so important every year but especially this year . But , first , let 's be frank : Russia is far from our only threat . In 2008 -- this is a document that a lot of people have looked at and thought , why did n't we do this before ? This was back , I think , in -- what was it ? About 5 years ago , it was put together . We had what we considered to be the top six Democrats and the top six Republicans on defense , and they put this book together . It is a very brief book , but we have been -- this has been our Bible . We have been doing this now for a long time , and the things that we were predicting at that time are actually becoming a reality . It tells us for the first time -- and this is significant . People do n't understand this . For the first time , we have two major adversaries at the same time . This has n't happened before . And , you know , we are talking about Russia . Yes , that is significant , and you have heard me say this before -- the Chinese Communist Party has been investing heavily in modernizing its military . Over the last two decades , their military spending has gone up 450 percent -- just in the last two decades . Now , we are not doing that over here . You know , I have to say -- and everyone realizes this -- these communist countries have a great advantage . They can move and move quickly , and they do n't seem to have any limitations . Now , we are seeing the results of that investment . They have tested hypersonic missiles that we do n't even have anymore . I have to say that again . Hypersonic missiles are something they have and they are using . They have tested . We have seen it . We do n't even have it , and we do n't have any counter to that . They are leapfrogging us in other critical areas , like artificial intelligence , and they are rapidly expanding their nuclear arsenal and infrastructure . These investments in military capability are done with real purpose . They are a threat to Taiwan and other allies in the Indo-Pacific . Ambassador Bi-khim Hsiao was in my office this morning -- Ambassador from Taiwan -- and we were looking at things that are going on there , just like we are looking at from the Russian area . But the threat China poses to our own interests ca n't be overstated or underestimated . Meanwhile , North Korea -- so it is not just those two countries . North Korea is out there . Iran is out there . They are also continuing their threatening behavior . North Korea is conducting missile tests of its own , and Iran continues to back proxies striking at U.S. troops and our interests -- most recently , we have seen in Syria . The terrorist threat in Afghanistan is also resurging thanks to the disastrous drawdown that continues to undermine U.S. credibility . We know that ISIS-K and al-Qaida have the desire and intent to strike our homeland . This is something that a lot of people do n't understand . A lot of people do n't believe the threat that is out there . Now we know when they will be able to strike us , and it is closer than you think . As soon as 6 months from now , the Senate Armed Services Committee was told just last month this could happen . So I do n't say this to be dramatic . This is a reality , plain and simple . The world is more dangerous than it has ever been in my lifetime -- by the way , people have reminded me over and over again yesterday and today , since it was my birthday , how long that lifetime has been -- and we have seen a lot , but we have n't seen anything like this before . National security needs to be the top priority . Without a strong military defending our way of life , nothing else matters . We can talk about other things , but it does n't really matter if we ca n't do that . [ [ Page S8416 ] ] Since World War II , we have ensured peace through the world by projecting strength . Our military should and must serve as a strong deterrent to our adversaries , and they have to know that they ca n't beat us . Some people are questioning that , but they have to know that they ca n't beat us , and we have to show them that they ca n't . Yet we are fully aware that they have things we do n't have . They have technology we do n't have . This is something we have n't dealt with before . President Biden 's inadequate defense budget request , the irresponsible drawdown in Afghanistan -- something he should n't have done ; the administration should not have done -- and the lack of commitment to shared nuclear security are calling that into question . It is evidence that we are n't prioritizing national defense , and we already have seen what happens when we do n't prioritize national defense . We see upticks in destabilizing , threatening behavior -- exactly what Putin is doing right now . Just imagine what would happen if Putin and Xi thought they stood a chance to beat us if we did n't turn things around , and that could happen . It is a reality today that people do n't understand and should understand . Americans take for granted the idea that our military is the best . You know , when I go back to not just my State of Oklahoma but all around the country , people assume that . You know , I am old enough to remember what was happening at the tail end of World War II . We learned a lesson . We learned to be prepared , and for a long period of time , we had the best of everything . We had the best modern equipment , all of this , and that is n't the case today . Americans take for granted that we have the best of everything , but we do n't . It is just not true anymore . Do n't just take my word for it , you know , just take it from me ; a couple of weeks ago , our Nation 's No . 2 military adviser , General Hyten -- no one disagreed -- I do n't know of anyone who would actually argue with General Hyten . He was explaining how China is on pace to surpass us if we do n't do something to change what is going on today . That is General Hyten . I do n't know a more knowledgeable person anywhere in America or elsewhere . We can meet these challenges . We can put our country back on the right track . That is going to take real investment and real strategy . Congress has a very important role to play here . We pass the National Defense Authorization Act and Defense appropriations each year , and every year , we give our military what it needs to set this thing right . Now , I am proud to say that this year 's NDAA goes a long ways to making our country more secure . I am not saying it is perfect , but it is very good and a necessary start . And that is what this is all about now . It is what we are going to be passing -- I am talking about tomorrow or the next day -- and going into this long process that includes both the House and the Senate . So let 's start with one of the biggest ways to strengthen our national defense : authorizing an additional $ 25 billion in funding for the Department of Defense . This is just a floor for defense spending . Now , it is important that we understand this President has not been a good President in terms of building the national defense . He just is n't . You know , his budget request shortchanged our national defense . In fact , if you put his budget numbers in terms of defense and nondefense , the amount that goes to nondefense averages about a 16- percent increase , and the amount that goes to defense is a 1.6-percent increase . Now , that is the President 's budget . It is not my budget . It is not our budget . It has n't passed , but nonetheless , that gives you an idea of where we are right now . The emphasis is not on defense . It should be , and it is not . President Biden 's budget request shortchanged the national defense . It did n't even keep pace with out-of-control inflation . Inflation right now -- the figure is above the 1.6 percent , and that is where we are today . It actually cut funding for our military even as we face the growing threats that I mentioned . And we are talking about the -- compared to the inflation thing that is happening right now . So I am glad the Armed Services Committee almost unanimously adopted my amendment to increase the Department of Defense 's budget top line . This is the bare minimum of what we need to meet the threats that we face . This is what underscores everything we do . The bill also makes sure this money is spent the right way . As we have for the past few years , we are using the 2018 national defense strategy -- that is this book I referenced just a minute ago -- as kind of our roadmap , and we are using this for that . The NDAA focuses on the Indo-Pacific , which is our priority theater , by emphasizing investment in the region through the Pacific Deterrence Initiative , the PDI , which we started in last year 's bill . The way this works is we are -- it is continuing as time goes by . We have a bill , and the bill is activated , usually in December , but then we are already into the next year . So while this seems -- people say : You are only talking about one bill a year . It does n't really work out that way . It strengthens our supply chain so we are not reliant upon China , but we are doing that right now . It addresses the threats posed from information warfare , and it deters the foreign malign influence . It also stands strong against Russia . Perhaps most importantly , it provides critical lethal aid to Ukraine , and we know that these things are working . While radios and cold- weather gear are needed , they wo n't deter Putin 's strategy and his ambitions . Weapons like the Javelin anti-tank missiles , on the other hand , remind him that invading and annexing Kyiv will have real and concrete costs . We know Russia and China are expanding their nuclear arsenals . Our nuclear stockpile serves as the cornerstone for our deterrent , so we have to keep it safe , secure , and effective . That is why the NDAA supports the nuclear modernization our military commanders say is their top priority . It provides support for our allies and partners around the world . Unfortunately , our allies and partners are questioning our commitment right now after what happened in Afghanistan , and they are feeling like they were being told and not consulted . They did n't even know -- that withdrawal that should not have taken place but did take place in Afghanistan is one that they were not even aware of . It provides the reassurance of American credibility that they desperately need to rebuild and cement those relationships . With strong allies and partners around the world , we will ensure the balance of power in our favor , but we are not there yet . When it comes to hard power , this bill makes serious investments in equipment we need to fight and win wars now -- growing our naval fleet , expanding next-generation fighter capability , and providing for the largest investment in military construction in a decade . It looks to the future too . We know that we need to accelerate innovation and develop the technology that is going to help defeat whatever our enemies might throw our way . Yet , in many of these emerging technologies , we risk falling behind . In some cases , we already have fallen behind . It is kind of hard for us to accept that in America , as we went through several decades -- I think since the Second World War -- not falling behind , but we have now . So this year 's NDAA invests in defense technology that would put us back ahead of our competitors . That is our goal . Things like microelectronics , artificial intelligence , hypersonic weapons , 5G -- these are the areas that we are working on to get back in the driver 's seat . We have fallen behind . It is hard to say that , that America is falling behind . You know , General Hyten said recently something that I really think is important for everyone to hear . He said that we must `` focus on speed and re-inserting speed back in the process of the Pentagon . . . and that means taking risk , and that means learning from failures , and that means failing fast and moving fast . '' I have to say that General Hyten is certainly one of the greatest warriors of our time . We should be listening to him . We have serious problems . We have to get policies and authorities in place to let the Pentagon move quickly and , as General Hyten put it , `` fail fast . '' As he retires this week , I think it is clear [ [ Page S8417 ] ] why he is a national hero . He knows what is going on . Now , too much is hampered by bureaucracy at the Pentagon . The NDAA encourages the Pentagon to move faster , to take risks , and to jumpstart the innovation that we need to succeed , but we have to realize the impact . This is really the most important thing this bill does . We take care of our troops . People talk all the time about how much we spend on military . I hear a lot of people around who do n't think we need a strong military . A lot of them talk about why we spend more on our military than Russia and China put together . Yes , that is true ; but we have costs that others do n't have . Communist countries do n't have the cost of taking care of their people . In fact , the most important thing we do is take care of our troops . Even though China and Russia are building up and modernizing their militaries , they do n't take care of their people -- they do n't claim to take care of their people -- and we do . The most expensive thing we do in our military is to take care of our military . We take care of the schools and the people who are out there taking the risk . This bill takes care of our troops in so many ways . It improves their healthcare . It provides education and childcare for their children , and makes sure their spouses can have meaningful employment as they move from area to area . It is a unique problem that our spouses do have , as they are moving around the country . And so , again , we are competing with China and Russia and other countries , and none of them have this problem . This is the greatest expense that we do . Our servicemembers represent the very best in the country . If they do have to go into harm 's way , it is our responsibility that they are the best prepared , best equipped , and the best led forces in the battlefield , and the bill does that . But we do n't want them to go to war . We want to prevent those wars from happening . As I said earlier , the best way we do that is by projecting strength , sending a message to our adversaries that there is no chance that they can beat us . The NDAA is the major way that we send that message . And that is why the NDAA -- the National Defense Authorization Act , the most significant bill of the year -- has been enacted into law every year for the past 60 years . This will be the 61st year . So we are going to get it passed , but it almost never comes up this late in the year . This is the disadvantage we are working from , but it always gets done eventually . We still have a lot of work left to do after this and not a lot of time to do it . You know , we ca n't afford late starts . If you do late starts , sometimes it ends up being just down to four people . Both my partner and I have been in this situation where we have been down to what they call the big four , making all these decisions ourselves . That is not what we are supposed to be doing . That is not what we want to do . But that is why the NDAA has been enacted into law every year for 60 years . We built this bill around Member requests . This is unique . This is something people need to understand . We are getting our requests from the Members that are serving with us here in the Senate . We are going to have an open amendment process . We are going to have an open amendment process , and this is what we have committed ourselves to do , to make sure we are doing . So you will get another chance to mark up this bill . So what we are doing right now is very important . You got to keep in mind , it is going to be done by the House ; it is going to be done by the Senate . It is going to be something that is the most significant thing that is happening this year . But we could never work too hard or too long for our troops and national defense . I know some of my colleagues are concerned about one provision we 've got -- that we have in this bill at this time , which was added in markup and included in the House bill too . Now , I oppose the addition of this provision , which changes the military draft -- what the military draft does . And I want you to hear this because , if enacted , it would expand the draft so that it is not just about finding combat replacements to serve on the frontlines ; it also requires women to register for the Selective Service , not just men . I 've always said , as a product of the draft myself , I know what the draft is . I was there and I served . I have always said that I understand that and I think the draft is essential . It changed my life , certainly . But I am strongly opposed to drafting our daughters and our granddaughters . So this is going to be coming up . We are going to be talking about this . Everything is going to be out in the open . Get ready for that fight , because that fight is coming , OK ? That is why I submitted an amendment to strike this provision from the underlying bill , and I will work to get it out of any conference report as well , OK ? Last week , we marked Veterans Day , and that should be a reminder to all of us why we do this . In fact , we have got 2.2 million reasons to do this -- 2.2 million future veterans -- our volunteer force , who put their lives in harm 's way and who rely on this bill getting done . And that does n't even include their families , who are sacrificing so much . So that 's out there , we know , and that is going to happen . I know my colleagues understand this . I know they understand our responsibility to our troops and to the American people . And so I look forward to our debate on this bill , and then passing it in the traditional , bipartisan way , as we always do ; and , together , we are going to fulfill our constitutional duty and meet these challenges that we face , and we have little time to waste in doing this . So this is the most significant bill of the year . That is what we are going to do . We are going to get it done . And let 's go do it right , OK ? I yield the floor . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The Senator from Montana . Mr. TESTER . Mr. President , I am pleased that the Senate has taken up the National Defense Authorization Act . There is a 60-year tradition in this body of getting this bill done because the importance of this bill transcends partisanship . In fact , 81 Senators of both parties joined forces earlier this year to override a senseless veto of this important bill by the former President . Now , while both sides of the aisle can work cooperatively to get this defense policy done , we are now seeing unprecedented -- unprecedented -- obstruction by the minority party for passing a budget that will fund the programs that our military and our veterans need . Now , look , if Republicans succeed in this obstruction , I am going to tell you that the government will be forced to go to a full-year continuing resolution . That is not workable . The result will be frozen spending levels for the Department of Defense and for the Department of Veterans Affairs , which amounts to a $ 70 billion cut in spending for those two Agencies alone , compared to the appropriations bills prepared in the U.S. Senate . I serve as chairman of the Senate Veterans ' Affairs Committee , and let me tell you what is at stake for America 's veterans and their families . Funding will be blocked for priorities like expanding veterans ' access to lifesaving mental healthcare services , enhancing women veterans ' healthcare , providing housing assistance , and expediting the delivery of benefits and care for those suffering from toxic exposure . Let me say this again . If we go to a 1-year continuing resolution , that means we go off of last year 's budget , last year 's spending bill . We will block priorities like expanding access to mental health services for our veterans . We will block services for expanding women veterans ' healthcare . We will block services for housing assistance and for expediting what is one of the most serious issues coming out of the conflict of 20 years in the Middle East , and that is care for those that are suffering from toxic exposure . The bottom line is this would keep the VA from properly addressing a whole host of issues on behalf of those who would put their lives on the line for this country , and they are going to continue to pay the price for us not doing our job . As chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee , I was able to draft a bill that provided a $ 31 billion increase for defense compared to last year . This military bill is consistent with the spending levels approved by [ [ Page S8418 ] ] the bill we are working on today . In fact , in an amendment offered by Senator Inhofe , that amendment passed 25 to 1 , which will plus-up this bill . So why is n't the defense appropriations bill flying through this Senate just like the NDAA ? Well , I will tell you . In September , the Republicans on the Appropriations Committee announced they would vote against all appropriations bills in part because Senator Inhofe 's bill does n't increase defense with enough spending . So the idea here is , just take money and throw it at the wall and hope that it 's spent right . The bottom line is there needs to be plans and there needs to be planning . And I am going to tell you , the last time I checked , the $ 31 billion increase is a pretty good chunk of dough . So it is simple . Do we want to fund the VA ? Do we want to fund the military ? Do we want to fund this country 's government ? Or do we want to go back to last year 's funding ? Which , by the way , would be totally inadequate , but it is what some on the other side of the aisle are advocating right now . Look , guys , we are in a continuing resolution right now . It expires on December 3 . If , in fact , we had a budget deal today , we could n't get an omnibus out for nearly 5 weeks . So what I am saying is this : no more finger pointing , no more changing the rules of the game , no more foot dragging . Do what the gang of 10 did on the bipartisan infrastructure package . Let 's go into negotiations to get to yes . Let 's all work together . Let 's not play irresponsible political games with our military and with our veterans and with everybody else who lives in this country . What are we here for ? Are we here to advocate for this country ? Or are we here to advocate for a political party ? I am telling you the appropriations bills should have been done last September . We should be sitting at the table today . I am ready to roll up my sleeves and help in any way that I possibly can to make sure these bills get through this body and to the President 's desk so we can fund our veterans and fund the needs that they have , so we can fund our military and deal with the threats that are facing us around the world . It is time , folks . It is time to quit talking , and it is time to start doing . I yield the floor . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The Senator from Iowa . Mr. GRASSLEY . Mr. President , my fellow Senators : On November 4 of this year , I introduced an amendment to this year 's national defense bill . This amendment focuses on the Office of Net Assessment . That office is within the Pentagon . The Office of Net Assessment 's purpose is to produce an annual net assessment , which is a long-term look at our military capabilities and those of our greatest adversaries . In 2019 , when I began to look at Stefan Halper 's contracting work for the Office of Net Assessment , something did n't look right . So I asked the inspector general to look into it . For those who are unaware , Halper was a central figure in the debunked Russia collusion investigation . And I do n't have to explain the Russia collusion investigation ; everybody in the U.S. Senate knows something about that and they know what it refers to . Halper secretly , at that time , recorded Trump campaign officials during Crossfire Hurricane . Halper also received over 1 million taxpayer dollars from the Office of Net Assessment for several research projects . But the question is : Were they really research projects ? But the inspector general found some problems with his contract : The Office of Net Assessment did n't require Halper to submit evidence that he actually talked to the people he cited in his work , which included Russian intelligence officers . Secondly , the Office of Net Assessment could n't provide sufficient documentation that Halper conducted all of his work in accordance with the law . Thirdly , the Office of Net Assessment did n't maintain sufficient documents to comply with all of the Federal contracting requirements and OMB 's guidelines . The inspector general also found that these problems were n't unique to Halper 's contract . This is the inspector general speaking up on this . I am reporting what he said . So these findings indicate systemic issues within the Office of Net Assessment in the Pentagon . Moreover , this office has spent taxpayers ' money on research projects unconnected to net assessments . In other words , they are spending money and wasting money that does n't deal very closely with our national defense . Two cases in point : The office funded a report titled `` On the Nature of Americans as a Warlike People : Workshop Report . '' Now , that report highlighted the `` level of American belligerency which is the result of the persistence of Scotch-Irish culture in America . '' That ought to get a lot of your attention . What does that have to do with the assessment of the capability of us to deliver on the constitutional responsibility of the Federal Government to the defense of the American people ? Or what does that have to do with our assessing the capability of our enemies ? Yet another report focused on Vladimir Putin 's neurological development and potential Asperger 's diagnosis . Now , I have highlighted these reports for the Pentagon , and I have asked for records from the Office of Net Assessment relating to some of its other work as well . To date , they still have n't been able to provide all of the records that they ought to provide to the Congress of the United States , under our constitutional responsibility , to see that money is faithfully spent according to congressional intent and that the laws are faithfully executed . While the Office of Net Assessment was busy wasting taxpayers ' money and not responding to congressional requests , China built its hypersonic missile program . Are we on top of that program ? It has got something to do with our enemy 's capability . As a result of all of these failures , then , like I told you , I introduced my amendment to the defense bill on November 4 . The amendment would require the Government Accountability Office to determine how much taxpayer money this unit actually uses for net assessment -- the reason they were set up . Are they doing their job ? Are they following the law ? Are they spending the taxpayers ' money responsibly ? I think I have shown , in some instances , where they have not . The amendment would filter out taxpayer-funded research that has nothing to do with net assessment . In other words , the Office of Net Assessment ought to be doing net assessment , and that deals with the capability of the U.S. Government to do the No . 1 responsibility of the Federal Government : the national defense of the American people . The second responsibility of this Agency is to determine the capability of our enemies to do damage to us . In other words , it is time that we find out how much money the Office of Net Assessment needs to actually do its job instead of acting like a slush fund for irrelevant or political research projects . Of course , if this happens and the taxpayers ' money is spent properly , this , in turn , will save the taxpayers , potentially , millions of dollars a year . I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment . I yield the floor . "

      "Mr. CORNYN . Mr. President , in my lifetime , the People 's Republic of China has gone from a poor and isolated country to one that now accounts for 20 percent of global domestic product . There is no question that the driving force behind this dramatic shift is the ruthlessness of the Chinese Communist Party led by President Xi . The CCP 's ruling strategy can best be described as win at all costs , which means that China never thinks twice about disregarding basic values and international norms . But there is no question that the most immediate and grave threats are against countries close to China 's borders . Last month , I led a congressional delegation to visit the Indo- Pacific to learn more from the people on the ground doing the hard work about the challenges they face and that we face in the Indo-Pacific . In my conversations with leaders in the Philippines , Taiwan , and India , I noticed they used a different vocabulary to describe China 's behavior than what we hear in Washington , DC . They did n't just talk about China 's ambitions ; they warned of its threats of aggression . They did n't just share concerns about China 's unification with Taiwan ; they spoke of the potential for an invasion . They did n't just bring up human rights abuses ; they condemned the blatant genocide committed against the Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in China . Words matter , of course , and the soft lexicon that is often used to describe the Chinese Communist Party and the People 's Republic of China here in the United States and particularly inside the beltway has the potential to create a false impression about China 's objectives , and it plays right into their hands . I think we should not continue to downplay the risks to the global world order and to peace itself by what China is doing . This is n't just a government interested in competing with the United States and other countries by playing by the rules of the international order ; the Chinese Communist Party is an aggressive , even belligerent and hostile power that has made economic gains through stealing intellectual property and other activities that belie its stated ambitions to become part of the liberal world order . For example , it squashes opposition by committing genocide against its own people and muzzling -- even murdering -- dissidents . China has literally become a police state , where the volumes of data that they have vacuumed up in that country and the ubiquitous technical surveillance that is mainly cameras that chronicle every aspect of the lives of their citizens and the use of things like artificial intelligence have allowed them to essentially control everything that does go on in China . And these are the same tools that they intend to use on other parts of the world . We know China has spent a lot of money developing its military resources . It has come a long way , while the United States and other countries were focused post-9/11 on the Global War on Terror . While we were focused on the Middle East , the PRC and the CCP wasted no time in rebuilding their capabilities from a military standpoint . And they are now aggressively claiming other parts of the region , not just Taiwan , but contested islands in the South China Sea that are claimed by Japan , by the Philippines , and other countries as well . Well , as I mentioned , one of the greatest looming threats in the region is a potential invasion of Taiwan by the People 's Republic of China . Of course , as you can see , Taiwan is just a small island of about 24 million people , just off the coast of mainland China . It is not much larger than the State of Maryland . In every possible way you can imagine , Taiwan is a stark contrast with China . For one , it is a true democracy . Voters go to the polls with the confidence that the election results are not predetermined . Successful businesses -- and there are many of them -- are built on good old-fashioned hard work , not government favoritism . And the people in Taiwan -- the Republic of China -- enjoy the same freedoms that we do here in the United States : freedom of speech , freedom of press , freedom of religion , and freedom of assembly . Taiwan has been a self-governing entity for more than 70 years , but the Chinese Communist Party falsely asserts that the island republic is part of its territory . Indeed , Taiwan faces China as the last outpost of democracy , standing watch against authoritarianism . Our congressional delegation met with the commander of the Indo- Pacific Command who described the current power dynamic rather succinctly . He said it is not a question of if China moves on Taiwan , but a question of when . Indeed , the language we heard from our military leadership and others in the region was far more urgent in terms of the threat of the People 's Republic of China against Taiwan than anything I have heard here in Washington , DC . According to our top military leaders , we have an idea how long Xi might wait . He himself has said that he wants to be ready by 2027 . But there is absolutely no guarantee that President Xi and the Chinese Communist Party of the People 's Republic of China -- there is no guarantee they wo n't move at another time of their choosing . As I said , Taiwan is not the only nation on the CCP 's list . China has territorial claims against a number of its neighbors . If you closed your eyes and just threw a dart at this region , you would likely hit one or more of those contested areas . Japan , the Philippines , Vietnam , Bhutan , India -- all of those countries claim sovereign territory that is also contested and claimed by the Chinese Communist Party of the People 's Republic of China . Of course , it has n't even been 25 years since China took control of Hong Kong under the `` one country , two systems '' framework . China had promised Hong Kong it would retain a high degree of autonomy for at least a half a century , but , obviously , Beijing eroded the freedoms and independence of Hong Kong to the point of basically hijacking that city and that entity . The Indian Minister of Foreign Affairs in Delhi told our delegation that Taiwan is n't the problem ; it is a China problem . And I think he has a point . In other words , what is at stake here is much larger than the future of just one nation . It is the entire scope of Beijing 's power and its ambitions in the region . Taiwan is not the final goal . It is the next step in a quest to reach regional dominance . Taiwan will likely be the first target because it has been identified by President Xi and the Chinese Communist Party , but it certainly wo n't be the last . I think it would be the ultimate in naivety , first , to think , well , this is just about Taiwan . It is not just about Taiwan . China will continue to threaten ; intimidate ; and , unfortunately , I think , ultimately threaten and invade its neighbors . And if that aggression goes unchecked , the CCP 's power grab will reach further and further . Plus , I believe in the power of deterrence , what Ronald Reagan called [ [ Page S8879 ] ] peace through strength . Nobody wants a military conflict in this region -- nobody . If the CCP can attain its goals without a shot being fired , they will try to do that . They are already trying to do that . But the fact of the matter is , if the People 's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party worked to conduct a military invasion of Taiwan , there are a multitude of risks of mistakes , miscalculations , and other dangers that could lead to a larger conflict . And I believe we have a responsibility in the United States to make sure , to the extent humanly possible , that that does not happen . We want peace , but we also want to stand up to the kind of aggression that we are seeing in practice and being threatened in the Indo-Pacific region . I believe that countering and first confronting the threats from the PRC is one of the greatest national security imperatives of our generation . Russia , obviously , is a significant power , mainly because it holds nuclear weapons ; but it mainly tries to find places where the United States is having a hard time and tries to make those situations more challenging for us . It does n't compare to the Chinese Communist Party and the PRC in terms of its regional ambitions , its attempt to project its power and its control over the region . We need to reorient the way that our country views and responds to this threat , and I believe that time is of the essence . As I said , some people have said that President Xi could wait until as late as 2027 to try to take Taiwan , but there is no guarantee that it could n't happen earlier if they deem it an opportunity to exist for them to do so . The longer Beijing is treated as a reasonable , goal-oriented country by the international community , the more aggressive it will become . One seemingly small step we must take is to describe China 's actions with accurate terms . We ca n't do the CCP any favor using watered-down euphemisms like human rights abuses when what we are really talking about is genocide . Here in the Senate , as we know , words are important , but those words need to be accompanied with action . We will soon vote on the National Defense Authorization Act , which will help us raise the issue and visibility of this potential conflict and raise the opportunity for deterrence in response to growing threats posed by China . We can do good work here on the Defense authorization bill to raise the cost to the PRC in the event they decided to invade Taiwan . The Defense Authorization Act includes a bipartisan bill I introduced with Senator Duckworth called the Taiwan Partnership Act . This bill would establish a formal partnership between the U.S. National Guard and the Taiwanese defense forces to strengthen Taiwan 's preparedness . Should troops need to deploy quickly in the event of a crisis , they would be armed with the same knowledge and skills as our dedicated U.S. National Guardsmen . This would also help Taiwan build up much of its asymmetric defenses . The Defense Authorization Act also includes legislation I introduced with Senator King , from Maine , to ensure that the United States and Taiwan can improve defense interoperability . There should n't be any barriers to cooperating on important security measures like integrated air and missile defense systems . The Defense Authorization Act includes other provisions to increase defense cooperation with Taiwan and equip the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command with greater resources . It also ensures that the United States will take a stronger approach and confront the threats being made by the Chinese Communist Party . This is not a partisan issue , as you can tell . After the delegation I led to Taipei , it was followed on by a bipartisan coalition mainly from Members of the House , and I think it is absolutely critical that that spirit of bipartisanship and the reality of bipartisanship continues to exist when it comes to the threat posed by the People 's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party . I appreciate colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have championed the provisions I mentioned and those who may have other ideas about how we can deter acts of aggression , not only against Taiwan but against other countries in the region when it comes to disputed islands and other territory . I want to thank Chairman Reed , Ranking Member Inhofe , and our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for all the work they have put into this bill so far . One of our most solemn responsibilities is to provide for the common defense , and this is the best way to ensure that our national defense is prepared to meet the challenges on the horizon . I yield the floor . "

      "Mr. THUNE . Mr. President , I am pleased that today we will finally move to a vote on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 . Thanks to the Democrats ' focus on their reckless Build Back Better tax-and-spending spree , consideration of the NDAA , one of the most important bills we consider every year , was delayed for months . Of course , once we finally got onto the bill , Democrats rushed the process . Senators of both parties filed a total of 1,000 amendments on this bill , but not one -- not a single one -- of those amendments received a vote on the Senate floor . But at least we are finally here set to pass this critical legislation . I am pleased the Republicans were able to strengthen this bill in committee and in the so-called preconference negotiations . This includes removing troublesome provisions like red-flag laws that would summarily suspend the Second Amendment rights of our men and women in uniform . Thanks in large part to Republican efforts , the final bill is $ 25 billion above President Biden 's inadequate budget request . [ [ Page S9172 ] ] We have made a lot of progress over the past several years on rebuilding our military , which , I might add , after years of underfunding and budgetary uncertainty , combined with heavy operational demands , had been left underequipped , undermanned , and underprepared to meet the threats of the 21st century . The situation had gotten so bad that in 2018 , the bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission released a report warning that our readiness had eroded to the point where we might struggle to win a war against a major power like Russia or China -- an especially chilling warning considering the mounting destabilization from both of these countries today . The Commission noted that we would be especially vulnerable if we were ever called on to fight a war on two fronts . But , as I said , over the past several years , we made a lot of progress on restoring military readiness . Unfortunately , President Biden 's inadequate budget request threatened to undo some of that progress . So I am pleased -- very pleased -- that , thanks in large part to Republican efforts , Democrats and Republicans have agreed on a final number that will continue our reinvestment in our military so that our men and women in uniform will have the resources they need to address the threats of the 21st century . With both China and Russia flexing their military power and the growing danger of a further Russian invasion of Ukraine , it is critically important that we ensure that our Nation is always prepared to defend itself and our vital national interests , whatever the threat . On the subject of Ukraine , I am very pleased the final bill we will vote on today includes an additional $ 50 million in military assistance for Ukraine . Ukraine has spent years dealing with a Russian invasion that threatens to push further into its sovereign territory , and we should be supporting the efforts of this free nation to defend itself from Russian aggression . I am particularly proud to announce that this year 's NDAA contains the necessary funding to continue essential preparation for the B-21 mission at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota . We found out in June of this year that Ellsworth had officially been named `` Main Operating Base 1 '' for the future B-21 bomber , home of the Raider . This designation not only means Ellsworth will be the first base to host the B-21 Raider but will also host the formal training unit and the first operational squadron . The stealth B-21 bomber will eventually replace the Air Force 's B-1s , which have been a proven workhorse within Global Strike Command but must be divested to free up capacity and resources for an even more agile and capable bomber fleet . Once operational , the B-21 Raider will be a critical part of our Nation 's long-range strike capabilities and nuclear deterrent well into the future . I am incredibly proud that South Dakota and Ellsworth were chosen to serve as the first operating base for the B-21s . When I first came to the Senate , the outlook for Ellsworth was n't so rosy . I had barely arrived here in the Senate when Ellsworth was placed on the base realignment and closure , or BRAC , list . It was an all-hands effort by the congressional delegation and Ellsworth and State and community leaders to make the case to the Bush administration and BRAC Commission to remove Ellsworth from the closure list . Many thought that South Dakota might not have the clout to make this stand , that we did n't wield enough influence . We were only given about a 12-percent chance of pulling through , but we were determined that we were n't going to lose Ellsworth . We stood our ground , and we won the day . Ellsworth was removed from the BRAC list that August , and we got right to work on building up the base so that we would never again find ourselves in the same position . In 2007 , we saw the Air Force Financial Services Center open at Ellsworth , and 2011 saw the arrival of the 89th Attack Squadron and its command and control stations for MQ-9 Reapers . In 2015 , a decade-long mission paid off with the quadrupling of the training airspace for the base . The Powder River Training Complex is now the largest training airspace in the continental United States and can be used for large- force exercises that draw combat aircraft from across this country . It is also well-suited for B-21 training , which is undoubtedly one of the reasons Ellsworth was chosen as the first home of the Raider . I am committed to ensuring that Ellsworth has everything it needs for its new mission so that it can continue to serve as one of our Nation 's essential military assets for decades to come . To that end , I worked to ensure that this year 's National Defense Authorization Act contain not only full funding for B-21 development but full funding for the first of many equipment and support facilities that will be needed for the B- 21 mission at Ellsworth , including a low observable coating and restoration facility , a wash rack and maintenance hangar , expanding the flight simulator facility , and more . It is imperative that these and follow-on military construction projects at Ellsworth stay on pace to ensure the B-21 , once fielded , can begin operations alongside the current B-1 mission at Ellsworth to enable a smooth transition from one mission to the next . The National Defense Authorization Act also ensures adequate support for our B-1s in South Dakota and in Texas and deployed on Bomber Task Force missions so that they have the resources they need until they are replaced by the B-21s . I will continue to do everything I can here in Congress to support our B-1s at Ellsworth and advance the B-21 mission . Providing for our Nation 's defense is one of our most serious responsibilities as Members of Congress . We have an obligation to ensure that our Nation is prepared to meet any threat , whether the danger comes from terrorism , rogue states , or major powers . We have an obligation to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the resources they need to confront the threats that we ask them to face . I am frustrated that it took us so long to move to consideration of this year 's National Defense Authorization Act , but I am happy we did at least manage to secure a solid piece of legislation , and I look forward to voting for this bill later today . I yield the floor . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The Senator from Oklahoma . Mr. INHOFE . Mr. President , I am very pleased that the Senate is finally voting on the fiscal year 2022 Defense authorization bill . It is the most significant bill of the year . There is an old document that nobody reads anymore called the Constitution . It kind of tells us what we are supposed to be doing around here , and sometimes we forget . We are talking about national defense . That is what we are supposed to be doing . That is why Congress has passed a defense authorization bill for the last 60 years . This will be the 61st year in a row . It will pass . It will pass in about another half hour from now . It is going to pass because it has passed in the past , and everyone realizes this is the most important thing we do here . A lot of people do n't say that , but it is true . Every year , we come together -- the House and the Senate , the Republicans and the Democrats -- and put our differences aside and build this bill together and show our servicemembers that we really support them . I think that is so important . All we have to do is argue about this bill , and what we are doing is reflecting on the people who are out there on the line , out there making the sacrifice and losing their lives in many cases . It is important that they know this is the most important thing we do , and that is exactly what we did this year . It looked a little different this year because the Senate did n't take up the bill until after Veterans Day . I was critical of Senator Chuck Schumer . We filed our bill -- Senator Reed and I filed this on September 22 . We did n't take it up until November 17 . That is 2 months that was wasted that we could have used and used very productively . We do n't need to do that . We ca n't let that happen again . It is the most important bill we do all year , and it should n't be left to the last minute . That is especially the case right now because we face threats like we have never before in my lifetime faced . We have China and Russia . They are growing and modernizing their militaries at a rate that we have never [ [ Page S9173 ] ] seen before and using their new technology to menace their neighbors . We are seeing Russia build up forces on the Ukrainian border , most likely intended to be used for them to attack . We feel that is what is happening now . We have seen evidence that China is testing hypersonic missile technology that we do n't even have . We do n't have hypersonic missile technology like the Chinese have . Those of us who have studied what happened in World War II , we swore we were n't going to let this happen . And for a long period of time , we had the best of everything . In one area where America should have the best of everything , we did n't have the best of everything . So we have seen threats and are seeing threats now that we have n't seen before . Yes , on the Ukrainian border -- we know what is happening there . We know 100,000 people are ready to go in . The Russians are there . Now we are seeing China use things that we do n't even have today . At the same time , following a disastrous withdrawal , terrorist organizations are resurging in Afghanistan . I think we all remember in Afghanistan -- what happened when the President went in and we had a withdrawal when we should n't have had a withdrawal . Our allies and partners are questioning our credibility and commitment because of that debacle . Iran continues to expand its nuclear program , and North Korea continues its own provocations . In short , we have no shortage of challenges to our security and our military supremacy . The security situation with both China and Russia has gotten far worse since the Armed Services Committee first advanced this bill back in July . It has gotten worse over the last few days and certainly every week . I ca n't think of a more necessary bill to pass right now , as we are going to do in another short period of minutes . This Defense authorization bill is the most important bill we have . I worked together with Chairman Reed , Senator Reed , Chairman Smith , Ranking Member Rogers , and the Armed Services Committees in both Chambers to build a bill that will help us respond to all these threats . We worked together . We worked together in the committee for a long time . People think , well , this is only something that we are doing -- those of us who are in the position to be providing the leadership in our military -- that we do once a year , but I can tell you right now , after we do this -- I think it will get passed today and will be signed -- we will start again on next year already . Our final product is a responsible , bipartisan path forward to strengthen the national security and gives our troops the resources , training , equipment , and benefits they deserve . We are talking about our troops . They need it . We do n't want them to have close fights out there . We do n't want them to have equipment that is n't the best equipment . I am afraid that we are in a situation right now where that is the case . The first and most important way to do that is by boosting the defense top line by $ 25 billion . That is what we did . The very first thing that we did was to bring that up to something where it is $ 25 billion over President Biden 's request . I know defense is n't Biden 's top priority , but we showed that it is a bipartisan priority in this Congress . In fact , it was the 2018 NDS . This is the NDS . This is the National Defense System . This is in 2018 , and we had six of the smartest Democrats in this field and six of the smartest Republicans . We got together and put together this thing called Providing for the National Defense . This was the Defense Strategy Commission . It is one we have been following since that time , and it shows that we can get things done . This is what we refer to . This is our pattern , and a budget cut like the President wanted is n't going to get us there . In total , this bill authorizes almost $ 778 billion for the Department of Defense and for nuclear programs at the Department of Energy . This increase supports many of the military 's unfunded priorities , things they need that President Biden 's inadequate budget could n't meet , plus things Congress agrees that the Department must fund in critical areas . And we provided a 35-percent increase above the President 's budget for military construction , the largest MILCON that we have had in over 10 years . We also provided a $ 4.7 billion increase for shipbuilding , allowing our military to purchase five new battle-force ships , which will be key in our priority theater , in the Indo-Pacific . And I think we know what the Chinese have been doing with their ship program . We bolstered support to key allies , like Taiwan and Ukraine . This year 's NDAA actually increases funding for the Ukrainian Security Assistance Initiative by $ 50 million , giving Ukraine some $ 300 million in defense , which is also in our defense too . And the bill includes strong bipartisan support for our nuclear deterrent , which is the cornerstone of our national security . We fully fund the nuclear modernization , which is a top priority for our military and will solidify support for a key leg of our nuclear triad . Our triad system is one that we have adhered to , and it is something that is working . This actually supports a key leg of that nuclear triad , which is the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent . The bill works at every turn to maintain our military supremacy and in some areas to spur us to catch up in other areas where we have fallen behind . We have fallen behind China and Russia in certain areas , and we do n't like that . And this is what we are trying to correct at the current time . One area where we do that is in cyber security . We have people , not just experts on the outside . There is one of the members of our Senate Armed Services Committee , Senator Mike Rounds , who probably knows more about cyber security than any one of the advisers that are out there . The bill creates a whole-of-government approach , the public-private partnership to detect and disrupt our adversary 's cyber operations . We also accelerate innovation in key emerging technologies , like artificial intelligence , hypersonic weapons , quantum computing , and 5G . We are doing these things . We are just not doing it as fast as we should , and this is one of the reasons that we are going to pass the most important bill of the year in just a few minutes . Our bill takes numerous steps to harden our industrial base and remove Russia and China from our national security supply chain . Of course , our top priority , this year and any year , is our troops , the brave men and women who have volunteered to lay down their lives , on the line , for our country . This year 's bill gives them a well- deserved pay raise and improves health . By the way , these are things that people who sometimes talk about the fact that we are spending some money -- I do n't know how many times I have heard people say : Well , we spend more on defense than China and Russia together . Well , that is true , but we do something that China and Russia does n't do . The most expensive item we have is taking care of our troops , making sure that the kids of our troops have schools to go to that are good schools , that we have good housing . They do n't care about things like that , but we do , and we spend more on our military , and people try to use that against us . Well , our people are first , and we are the only country that believes that . It prevents servicemembers from being dishonorably discharged for refusing the coronavirus vaccine . This is something where we changed a system that otherwise would have offered a dishonorable discharge , and it is in this bill . So it is a good bill . It is not perfect . No bill is perfect . There are some things I would have had in this bill and I am sure that Senator Reed would have had in this bill that did n't make it . Before we close , I do want to thank the good people who work so hard on this bill on the floor . People do n't realize that . You go back to the real world and you talk to real people , as I do when I go back to Oklahoma , and they point out that they do n't believe that people are really working . But in the case of the military , they are . I just have to say the hours that they work . I had occasion to talk to the group about John Wason -- John Wason is the minority staff director -- and about the number of hours that he works and that his team works . And I am going to read the names of this [ [ Page S9174 ] ] team . Senator Reed is going to be reading the names of the majority on the team . But I think it is important that people understand that we have committee staff who work hard , and we are very thankful for the people who provide all that effort . On his team , John Wason has Rick Berger , Tom Goffus , Scott Richardson , Greg Lilly , Marta Hernandez , Jennie Wright , Adam Barker , Allen Edwards , Katie Magnus , Sean O'Keefe , Brad Patout , Jason Potter , Brian Slatterly , Katie Sutton , Eric Trager , Adam Trull , T.C . Williams , Robert Winkler , and Annie Caputo . From my staff I had Luke Holland , Dan Hillenbrand , Don Archer , Dan Holder , Sam Trizza , Esther Salters , Jake Johnson , Jake Hinch , Alexandra Slocum , Victor Sarmiento , Dixon Yonan , Leacy Burke -- what would we do without Leacy Burke ? -- Laurie Fitch , and Naomi Walker . And sometimes we forget about the hard-working floor staff . Nobody ever mentions that . We have a lot of the same people who have been there for a number of years , and we could n't operate without them . And they were really busy on this bill . And that is Robert Duncan , Chris Tuck , Tony Hanagan , Katherine Foster , Brian Canfield , Max Boyd , and Maddie Sanborn . I am grateful for all of their services . And do n't forget : This is only half of the battle . After this , we have to go through and after we have made the priorities that we have made , the appropriators will get busy and do what they have done to be a part of this effort , which is the most significant effort that we are having . So today I encourage all of my colleagues to support this year 's National Defense Authorization bill -- I know they will -- and extend our 60-year track record of getting this bill done . And let 's tell the troops that we love them and we support them . With that , I yield to Chairman Jack Reed . The PRESIDING OFFICER . The Senator from Rhode Island . Mr. REED . Mr. President , I rise to express my support for the fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act . I am pleased , as we all are , that we will be voting soon on passage . I would like to thank Ranking Member Inhofe for his leadership and his thoughtfulness on this bill . He has been an excellent partner throughout this whole process . Our Nation faces an enormous range of security challenges , and it is more important than ever that we provide our military men and women with the support they need to keep Americans safe . To that end , this bill makes great progress . It addresses a broad range of pressing issues , from strategic competition with China and Russia , to disruptive technologies like hypersonics , AI , and quantum computing , to modernizing our ships , aircraft , and vehicles . It provides our servicemembers with the resources and support they need to defend our Nation , while at the same taking care of their families . Importantly , this bill authorizes a well-deserved 2.7-percent pay raise for both military members and the DOD civilian workforce . It also increases parental leave to 12 weeks for all servicemembers and creates a new 2-week bereavement leave benefit for both military and Federal civilian employees . I want to especially note that this bill includes historic , sweeping reforms to the Uniform Code of Military Justice and how the military investigates and prosecutes sexual assault and other offenses , including murder , manslaughter , kidnapping , and many other crimes . Just as my Senate colleagues , the President 's Independent Review Commission , and survivors advocate groups have called for , this bill takes prosecutorial power away from the chain of command for these cases . Our bill creates `` special trial counsel , '' highly specialized prosecutors who will have exclusive , binding , and final decision-making authority over whether to prosecute these offenses . This is a sea change for the military justice system , and I am grateful to my colleagues in both Chambers and on both sides of the aisle for working together to achieve this historic reform for the well-being of our military women and men . Indeed , we listened to survivors , advocates , and experts because we owe it to our servicemembers to get this policy right . The world is as dangerous and complex as it has ever been . We depend on the military to answer the call in these challenging times , and we owe it to them to ensure the policies we enact on this matter and others preserves this Nation 's military power and cohesion . I respect those who might see this matter differently , but this bill makes our country and our troops more secure because we listened to advocates and experts to reach a compromise with the House of Representatives . This year 's defense bill also makes excellent progress toward meeting the challenges of long-term strategic competition with China and Russia . It invests in the people , platforms , infrastructure , and game- changing technologies that will define the future . It extends and modifies the Pacific Deterrence Initiative , or PDI , and reiterates the Senate 's intent to improve our force posture in the Indo-Pacific , increase readiness and presence , and build the capabilities of our partners and allies to counter the increasing aggression of China . Similarly , this year 's bill authorizes the continuation of the European Deterrence Initiative , or EDI , in recognition of the vital need to support our allies and partners in Europe as we work toward the shared goals of deterring Russian aggression , addressing strategic competition , and mitigating shared security concerns . With respect to our services , we have taken steps to improve their capabilities and their ability to fight and win . Across the Army , Navy , Air Force , Marine Corps , and Space Force , this bill makes significant efforts to improve the readiness of our aircraft , ships , vehicles , missiles , and weapons systems . It authorizes significant increases in military construction projects , modernizing our nuclear triad and missile defense systems , and investing in cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence , microelectronics , advanced materials , 5G , and biotechnology . And with regard to our withdrawal from Afghanistan , we must capture the lessons of the last two decades to ensure that our future counterterrorism efforts in Afghanistan and elsewhere continue to hold violent extremists at bay . To that end , I am pleased that this bill includes the Afghanistan War Commission Act , an amendment spearheaded by Senator Duckworth . This bill was originally crafted by the Armed Services Committee after a series of thoughtful hearings , discussions , and debates on both sides of the aisle . Through the committee markup process , we considered more than 300 amendments and ultimately adopted 143 amendments . Senator Inhofe and I introduced this bill to the full Senate with the intent of adding more amendments on the floor . Although we were not able to come to an agreement to debate and vote on several amendments on the floor , we were ultimately able to adopt amendments from Senators on both sides of the aisle in the final legislation . Over the past several weeks , the Senate and House Armed Services Committees have worked around the clock to come to an agreement on this final version of this bill . I am proud of the improvements we made throughout this process , and I was pleased to see the House vote last week in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion , 363 to 70 , to pass the bill . We have produced a strong NDAA that both parties and both chambers can support , and the President will be able to sign . I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the phenomenal staff who have made this bill possible .
