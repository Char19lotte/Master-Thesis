         amendment no. 21 offered by mr. cardenas of california

       Add at the end of subtitle C of title XIII of division A 
     the following:

     SEC. 13__. REPORT ON AZERBAIJAN.

       (a) Sense of Congress on Azerbaijan&#x27;s Illegal Detention of 
     Armenian Prisoners of War.--
       (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
       (A) On September 27, 2020, Azerbaijan, with support from 
     Turkey and foreign militia groups, launched a military 
     assault on Nagorno-Karabakh, also known as Artsakh, resulting 
     in the deaths of thousands and displacing tens of thousands 
     of ethnic Armenian residents.
       (B) On November 9, 2020, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Russia 
     signed a tripartite statement to end the conflict.
       (C) In signing the November 9 statement, all parties agreed 
     that the ``exchange of prisoners of war, hostages and other 
     detainees as well as the remains of the fatalities shall be 
     carried out.&#x27;&#x27;.
       (D) The Third Geneva Convention, of which Azerbaijan is a 
     signatory, and customary international law require the 
     release of prisoners of war and captured civilians upon the 
     cessation of hostilities and require that all detainees be 
     treated humanely.
       (E) Despite Azerbaijan&#x27;s obligations under the Geneva 
     Conventions and their commitments in signing the November 9 
     statement, long after the end of the conflict, the Government 
     of Azerbaijan continues to detain an estimated 200 Armenian 
     prisoners of war, hostages, and detained persons, 
     misrepresenting their status in an attempt to justify their 
     continued captivity.
       (F) Human Rights Watch reported in December 2020, that 
     Azerbaijani military forces had mistreated ethnic Armenian 
     prisoners of war and subjected them to ``physical abuse and 
     humiliation&#x27;&#x27;.
       (G) Columbia University&#x27;s Institute for the Study of Human 
     Rights issued a report on the conflict that ``document[s] 
     crimes against humanity and other atrocities committed by 
     Azerbaijani armed forces and Turkish-backed Islamist fighters 
     against Armenians&#x27;&#x27;, including beheadings, summary 
     executions, and the desecration of human remains.
       (H) There is limited reliable information about the 
     condition or treatment of prisoners of war and captured 
     civilians, and there is significant concern that female 
     detainees in particular could be subject to sexual assaults 
     and other mistreatment.
       (I) The continued detainment of prisoners of war and 
     captured civilians by Azerbaijan calls into serious question 
     their commitment to human rights and negotiating an 
     equitable, lasting peace settlement.
       (J) Armenia has fulfilled its obligations under the 
     November 9 statement and international law by returning 
     Azerbaijani prisoners of war.
       (K) The United States is a co-chair, along with France and 
     Russia, of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in 
     Europe Minsk Group, which was created to seek a durable and 
     peaceful solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
       (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
       (A) Azerbaijan must immediately and unconditionally return 
     all Armenian prisoners of war and captured civilians; and
       (B) the Biden Administration should engage at all levels 
     with Azerbaijani authorities, including through the 
     Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Minsk 
     Group process, to make clear the importance of adhering to 
     their obligations, under the November 9 statement and 
     international law, to immediately release all prisoners of 
     war and captured civilians.
       (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, in 
     consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the 
     relevant congressional committees a report on the following:
       (1) United States-origin parts and technology discovered in 
     Turkish Bayraktar unmanned aerial vehicles deployed by 
     Azerbaijan against Nagorno Karabakh between September 27, 
     2020 and November 9, 2020, including an assessment of any 
     potential violations of violations of the Arms Export Control 
     Act or other applicable laws, sanctions policies, or other 
     provisions of United States law related to the discovery of 
     such parts and technology.
       (2) Azerbaijan&#x27;s use of white phosphorous, cluster bombs, 
     and prohibited munitions deployed by Azerbaijan against 
     civilians and civilian infrastructure in Nagorno Karabakh 
     between September 27, 2020, and November 9, 2020, including 
     an assessment of any potential violations of United States or 
     international law related to the use of such munitions.
       (3) Turkey&#x27;s and Azerbaijan&#x27;s recruitment of foreign 
     terrorist fighters to participate in Azerbaijan&#x27;s offensive 
     military operations against Nagorno Karabakh between 
     September 27, 2020, and November 9, 2020, including an 
     assessment of any related potential violations of United 
     States law, the International Convention against the 
     Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries, or 
     other international or multilateral treaties.
       (c) Relevant Congressional Committees.--In this section, 
     the term ``relevant congressional committees&#x27;&#x27; means the 
     Committee on Foreign Affairs and Committee on Armed Services 
     of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign 
     Relations and Committee on Armed Services of the Senate.
       (1) Azerbaijan must immediately and unconditionally return 
     all Armenian prisoners of war and captured civilians; and
       (2) the Biden Administration should engage at all levels 
     with Azerbaijani authorities, including through the 
     Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Minsk 
     Group process, to make clear the importance of adhering to 
     their obligations, under the November 9 statement and 
     international law, to immediately release all prisoners of 
     war and captured civilians.

                   CARSON CENTER FOR MORTUARY AFFAIRS.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) The Dover Air Force Base is home to more than 4,000 
     active-duty military and civilian employees tasked with 
     defending the United States of America.
       (2) The Dover Air Force Base supports the mission of the th

       (3) The ``Eagle Wing&#x27;&#x27; serves as a unit of the Eighteenth 
     Air Force headquartered with the Air Mobility Command at 
     Scott Air Force Base in Illinois. (4)
       (4) The ``Eagle Wing&#x27;&#x27; flies hundreds of missions 
     throughout the world, provides a quarter of the United 
     States&#x27; strategic airlift capability, and boasts a global 
     reach to over 100 countries around the world.
       (5) The Dover Air Force Base hosts incredible aircrews and 
     aircraft utilized by the United States Air Force, including 
     the C-5M Super Galaxy and C-17A Globemaster III aircraft.
       (6) The recent Afghanistan airlift is testament to the 
     dedication and readiness of the Dover Air Force Base aircrews 
     and their aircraft.
       (7) The Dover Air Force Base operates the largest and 
     busiest air freight terminal in the Department of Defense, 
     fulfilling an important role in our Nation&#x27;s military.

     of public awareness the work of the service members and staff 
     of the Center for Mortuary Affairs.

     Afghanistan was the most recent dignified transfer, it is

     Affairs are often so moved by their work that they 
     voluntarily elect to serve multiple tours because they feel 
     called to serve our fallen heroes.
       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress 
     that the people of the United States should--

     section:

     SEC. 5__. REDUCTION OF GENDER-RELATED INEQUITIES IN COSTS OF

       (b) Regulations.--Not later than September 30, 2022, each

       (1) The out-of-pocket cost to an officer or enlisted member

         amendment no. 73 offered by ms. brownley of california

       Page 481, after line 2, insert the following new section:

     SEC. 576. JUSTICE FOR WOMEN VETERANS.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) In June 1948, Congress enacted the Women&#x27;s Armed 
     Services Integration Act of 1948, which formally authorized 
     the appointment and enlistment of women in the regular 
     components of the Armed Forces.
       (2) With the expansion of the Armed Forces to include 
     women, the possibility arose for the first time that members 
     of the regular components of the Armed Forces could become 
     pregnant.
       (3) The response to such possibilities and actualities was 
     Executive Order 10240, signed by President Harry S. Truman in 
     1951, which granted the Armed Forces the authority to 
     involuntarily separate or discharge a woman if she became 
     pregnant, gave birth to a child, or became a parent by 
     adoption or a stepparent.
       (4) The Armed Forces responded to the Executive order by 
     systematically discharging any woman in the Armed Forces who 
     became pregnant, regardless of whether the pregnancy was 
     planned, unplanned, or the result of sexual abuse.

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4901">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4901">H4901</a></a>]]

       (5) Although the Armed Forces were required to offer women 
     who were involuntarily separated or discharged due to 
     pregnancy the opportunity to request retention in the 
     military, many such women were not offered such opportunity.
       (6) The Armed Forces did not provide required separation 
     benefits, counseling, or assistance to the members of the 
     Armed Forces who were separated or discharged due to 
     pregnancy.
       (7) Thousands of members of the Armed Forces were 
     involuntarily separated or discharged from the Armed Forces 
     as a result of pregnancy.
       (8) There are reports that the practice of the Armed Forces 
     to systematically separate or discharge pregnant members 
     caused some such members to seek an unsafe or inaccessible 
     abortion, which was not legal at the time, or to put their 
     children up for adoption, and that, in some cases, some women 
     died by suicide following their involuntary separation or 
     discharge from the Armed Forces.
       (9) Such involuntary separation or discharge from the Armed 
     Forces on the basis of pregnancy was challenged in Federal 
     district court by Stephanie Crawford in 1975, whose legal 
     argument stated that this practice violated her 
     constitutional right to due process of law.
       (10) The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in 
     Stephanie Crawford&#x27;s favor in 1976 and found that Executive 
     Order 10240 and any regulations relating to the Armed Forces 
     that made separation or discharge mandatory due to pregnancy 
     were unconstitutional.
       (11) By 1976, all regulations that permitted involuntary 
     separation or discharge of a member of the Armed Forces 
     because of pregnancy or any form of parenthood were 
     rescinded.
       (12) Today, women comprise 17 percent of the Armed Forces, 
     and many are parents, including 12 percent of whom are single 
     parents.
       (13) While military parents face many hardships, today&#x27;s 
     Armed Forces provides various lengths of paid family leave 
     for mothers and fathers. for both birth and adoption of 
     children.
       (b) Sense of Congress.--
       (1) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
     women who served in the Armed Forces before February 23, 1976 
     should not have been involuntarily separated or discharged 
     due to pregnancy or parenthood.
       (2) Expression of remorse.--Congress hereby expresses deep 
     remorse for the women who patriotically served in the Armed 
     Forces, but were forced, by official United States policy, to 
     endure unnecessary and discriminatory actions, including the 
     violation of their constitutional right to due process of 
     law, simply because they became pregnant or became a parent 
     while a member of the Armed Forces.
       (c) GAO Study of Women Involuntarily Separated or 
     Discharged Due to Pregnancy or Parenthood.--
       (1) Study required.--The Comptroller General of the United 
     States shall conduct a study regarding women involuntarily 
     separated or discharged from the Armed Forces due to 
     pregnancy or parenthood during the period of 1951 through 
     1976. The study shall identify--
       (A) the number of such women, disaggregated by--
       (i) Armed Force;
       (ii) grade;
       (iii) race; and
       (iv) ethnicity;
       (B) the characters of such discharges or separations;
       (C) discrepancies in uniformity of such discharges or 
     separations;
       (D) how such discharges or separations affected access of 
     such women to health care and benefits through the Department 
     of Veterans Affairs; and
       (E) recommendations for improving access of such women to 
     resources through the Department of Veterans Affairs.
       (2) Briefing and report.--
       (A) Briefing.--Not later than 6 months after the date of 
     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall brief 
     the Committees on Armed Services and the Committees on 
     Veterans&#x27; Affairs of the Senate and the House of 
     Representatives on the study.
       (B) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the 
     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit a 
     report to the Committees on Armed Services and the Committees 
     on Veterans&#x27; Affairs of the Senate and the House of 
     Representatives on the results of the study conducted under 
     paragraph (1).


         amendment no. 74 offered by ms. brownley of california

       At the end of title LX, add the following new section:

     SEC. 60__. GRANTS TO STATES FOR SEAL OF BILITERACY PROGRAMS.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) The people of the United States celebrate cultural and 
     linguistic diversity and seek to prepare students with skills 
     to succeed in the 21st century.
       (2) It is fitting to commend the dedication of students who 
     have achieved proficiency in multiple languages and to 
     encourage their peers to follow in their footsteps.
       (3) The congressionally requested Commission on Language 
     Learning, in its 2017 report ``America&#x27;s Languages: Investing 
     in Language Education for the 21st Century&#x27;&#x27;, notes the 
     pressing national need for more people of the United States 
     who are proficient in two or more languages for national 
     security, economic growth, and the fulfillment of the 
     potential of all people of the United States.
       (4) The Commission on Language Learning also notes the 
     extensive cognitive, educational, and employment benefits 
     deriving from biliteracy.
       (5) Biliteracy in general correlates with higher graduation 
     rates, higher grade point averages, higher rates of 
     matriculation into higher education, and higher earnings for 
     all students, regardless of background.
       (6) The study of America&#x27;s languages in elementary and 
     secondary schools should be encouraged because it contributes 
     to a student&#x27;s cognitive development and to the national 
     economy and security.
       (7) Recognition of student achievement in language 
     proficiency will enable institutions of higher education and 
     employers to readily recognize and acknowledge the valuable 
     expertise of bilingual students in academia and the 
     workplace.
       (8) States such as Utah, Arizona, Washington, and New 
     Mexico have developed innovative testing methods for 
     languages, including Native American languages, where no 
     formal proficiency test currently exists.
       (9) The use of proficiency in a government-recognized 
     official Native American language as the base language for a 
     Seal of Biliteracy, with proficiency in any additional 
     partner language demonstrated through tested proficiency, has 
     been successfully demonstrated in Hawaii.
       (10) Students in every State and every school should be 
     able to benefit from a Seal of Biliteracy program.
       (b) Definitions.--In this section:
       (1) Esea definitions.--The terms ``English learner&#x27;&#x27;,

     4(a) that is established or improved, and carried out, with 
     funds received under this section.
       (4) Second language.--The term ``second language&#x27;&#x27; means 
     any language other than English (or a Native American

             amendment no. 91 offered by mr. case of hawaii

       At the end of subtitle H of title XXVIII, add the following 
     new section:

     SEC. 28__. ANNUAL REPORT ON RENEWAL OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
                   EASEMENTS AND LEASES OF LAND IN HAWAI`I.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) Lands throughout the State of Hawai`i, which are 
     currently owned and leased by the Department of Defense or in 
     which the Department of Defense otherwise has a real property 
     interest, are critical to maintaining the readiness of the 
     Armed Forces now stationed or to be stationed in Hawai`i and 
     throughout the Indo-Pacific region and elsewhere.
       (2) Securing long-term continued utilization of those lands 
     by the Armed Forces is thus critical to the national defense.
       (3) As a result of various factors, including complex land 
     ownership and utilization issues and competing actual and 
     potential uses, the interdependency of the various military 
     components, and the necessity of maintaining public support 
     for the presence and operations of the Armed Forces in 
     Hawai&#x27;i, the realization of the congressional and Department 
     of Defense goals of ensuring the continuity of critical land 
     and facilities infrastructure requires a sustained, 
     dedicated, funded, top-level effort to coordinate realization 
     of these goals across the Armed Forces, between the 
     Department of Defense and other agencies of the Federal 
     Government, and between the Department of Defense and the 
     State of Hawai&#x27;i and its civilian sector.
       (4) The end result of this effort must account for military 
     and civilian concerns and for the changing missions and needs 
     of all components of the Armed Forces stationed or otherwise 
     operating out of the State of Hawai`i as the Department of 
     Defense adjusts to meet the objectives outlined in the 
     National Defense Strategy.
       (b) Annual Report.--
       (1) Report required.--Not later than February 1 of each 
     year, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the 
     congressional defense committee a report describing the 
     progress being made by the Department of Defense to renew 
     each Department of Defense land lease and easement in the 
     State of Hawai`i that--
       (A) encompasses one acre or more; and
       (B) will expire within 10 years after the date of the 
     submission of the report.
       (2) Report elements.-- Each report submitted under 
     paragraph (1) shall include the following:
       (A) The location, size, and expiration date of each lease 
     and easement.
       (B) Major milestones and expected timelines for maintaining 
     access to the land covered by each lease and easement.
       (C) Actions completed over the preceding two years for each 
     lease and easement.
       (D) Department-wide and service-specific authorities 
     governing each lease and easement extension.
       (E) A summary of coordination efforts between the Secretary 
     of Defense and the Secretaries of the military departments.
       (F) The status of efforts to develop an inventory of 
     military land in Hawai`i, including current and possible 
     future uses of the land, that would assist in land 
     negotiations with the State of Hawai`i.
       (G) The risks and potential solutions to ensure the 
     renewability of required and critical leases and easements.


             amendment no. 92 offered by mr. case of hawaii

       At the end of subtitle B of title III, add the following 
     new section:

     SEC. 3__. INSPECTION OF PIPING AND SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE AT 
                   RED HILL BULK FUEL STORAGE FACILITY, HAWAI`I.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) The continued availability and use of the Red Hill Bulk 
     Fuel Storage Facility in Honolulu, Hawai`i is a matter of 
     national security. Persistent fuel availability in quantity, 
     location, and secured siting is a key

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4905">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4905">H4905</a></a>]]

     component in ensuring resilient logistical support for 
     sustained forward operations in the Indo-Pacific region and 
     the execution of the National Defense Strategy, including the 
     objectives of maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific.
       (2) The Red Hill Bulk Fuel Facility is constructed in 
     basalt rock that overlays a key aquifer serving as one of the 
     major ground water resources for the fresh water needs of the 
     City of Honolulu, including key military installations and 
     associated facilities. Past leaks from the tanks and other 
     infrastructure of the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, 
     while not resulting in any appreciable effect to the aquifer, 
     raise significant questions whether the facility is being 
     operated and maintained to the highest standard possible and 
     whether the facility presents a material risk to the aquifer 
     and to Honolulu water resources.
       (3) Safety inspections of the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage 
     Facility at 10-year intervals, as required by the American 
     Petroleum Institute 570 standards, set the upper boundaries 
     for inspections.
       (b) Sense of Congress.--In order to fully effectuate 
     national security, assure the maximum safe utilization of the 
     Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, and fully address 
     concerns as to potential impacts of the facility on public 
     health, it is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the 
     Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency should--
       (1) operate and maintain the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage 
     Facility to the highest standard possible; and
       (2) require safety inspections to be conducted more 
     frequently based on the corrosion rate of the piping and 
     overall condition of the pipeline system and support 
     equipment at the facility.
       (c) Inspection Requirement.--
       (1) Inspection required.--The Secretary of the Navy shall 
     direct the Naval Facilities Engineering Command to conduct an 
     inspection of the pipeline system, supporting infrastructure, 
     and appurtenances, including valves and any other corrosion 
     prone equipment, at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility.
       (2) Inspection agent; standards.--The inspection required 
     by this subsection shall be performed--
       (A) by an independent American Petroleum Institute 
     certified inspector who will present findings of the 
     inspection and options to the Secretary of the Navy for 
     improving the integrity of the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage 
     Facility and its appurtenances; and
       (B) in accordance with the Unified Facilities Criteria 
     (UFC-3-460-03) and American Petroleum Institute 570 
     inspection standards.
       (3) Exception.--The inspection required by this subsection 
     excludes the fuel tanks at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage 
     Facility.
       (d) Life-cycle Sustainment Plan.--In conjunction with the 
     inspection required by subsection (c), the Naval Facilities 
     Engineering Command shall prepare a life-cycle sustainment 
     plan for the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, which shall 
     consider the current condition and service life of the tanks, 
     pipeline system, and support equipment.
       (e) Submission of Results and Plan.--Not later than one 
     year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
     Secretary of the Navy shall submit to the Committees on Armed 
     Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives a 
     report containing--
       (1) the results of the inspection conducted under 
     subsection (c);
       (2) the life-cycle sustainment plan prepared under 
     subsection (d); and
       (3) options on improving the security and maintenance of

       ``(5) Reports.--
       ``(A) Timing.--
       ``(i) In general.--The Director, in consultation with 
     Sector Risk Management Agencies and the heads of other 
     Federal departments and agencies, as appropriate, shall 
     establish reporting timelines for covered entities to submit 
     promptly to the Office covered cybersecurity incident 
     reports, as the Director determines reasonable and 
     appropriate based on relevant factors, such as the nature, 
     severity, and complexity of the covered cybersecurity 
     incident at issue and the time required for investigation, 
     but in no case may the Director require reporting by a 
     covered entity earlier than 72 hours after confirmation that 
     a covered cybersecurity incident has occurred.
       ``(ii) Considerations.--In determining reporting timelines 
     under clause (i), the Director shall--

       ``(I) consider any existing regulatory reporting 
     requirements, similar in scope purpose, and timing to the 
     reporting requirements under this section, to which a covered 
     entity may also be subject, and make efforts to harmonize the 
     timing and contents of any such reports to the maximum extent 
     practicable; and
       ``(II) balance the Agency&#x27;s need for situational awareness 
     with a covered entity&#x27;s ability to conduct incident response 
     and investigations.

     cybersecurity incident report through a third party entity or 
     Information Sharing and Analysis Organization.
       ``(ii) Duty to ensure compliance.--Third party reporting 
     under this subparagraph does not relieve a covered entity of 
     the duty to ensure compliance with the requirements of this 
     paragraph.
       ``(C) Supplemental reporting.--A covered entity shall 
     submit promptly to the Office, until such date that such 
     covered entity notifies the Office that the cybersecurity 
     incident investigation at issue has concluded and the 
     associated covered cybersecurity incident has been fully 
     mitigated and resolved, periodic updates or supplements to a 
     previously submitted covered cybersecurity incident report if 
     new or different information becomes available that would 
     otherwise have been required to have been included in such 
     previously submitted report. In determining reporting 
     timelines, the Director may choose to establish a flexible, 
     phased reporting timeline for covered entities to report 
     information in a manner that aligns with investigative 
     timelines and allows covered entities to prioritize incident 
     response efforts over compliance.
       ``(D) Contents.--Covered cybersecurity incident reports 
     submitted pursuant to this section shall contain such 
     information as the Director prescribes, including the 
     following information, to the extent applicable and

     related to the actor reasonably believed to be responsible 
     for such incident.
       ``(iv) Where applicable, identification of the category or 
     categories of information that was, or is reasonably believed 
     to have been, accessed or acquired by an unauthorized person.
       ``(v) Contact information, such as telephone number or 
     electronic mail address, that the Office may use to contact 
     the covered entity or, where applicable, an authorized agent 
     of such covered entity, or, where applicable, the service 
     provider, acting with the express permission, and at the 
     direction, of such covered entity, to assist with compliance 
     with the requirements of this section.
       ``(6) Responsibilities of covered entities.--Covered 
     entities that experience a covered cybersecurity incident 
     shall coordinate with the Office to the extent necessary to 
     comply with this section, and, to the extent practicable, 
     cooperate with the Office in a manner that supports enhancing 
     the Agency&#x27;s situational awareness of cybersecurity threats 
     across critical infrastructure sectors.
       ``(7) Harmonizing reporting requirements.--In establishing 
     the reporting requirements and procedures under paragraph 
     (1), the Director shall, to the maximum extent practicable--
       ``(A) review existing regulatory requirements, including 
     the information required in such reports, to report 
     cybersecurity incidents that may apply to covered entities, 
     and ensure that any such reporting requirements and 
     procedures avoid conflicting, duplicative, or burdensome 
     requirements; and
       ``(B) coordinate with other regulatory authorities that 
     receive reports relating to cybersecurity incidents to 
     identify opportunities to streamline reporting processes, and 
     where feasible, enter into agreements with such authorities 
     to permit the sharing of such reports with the Office, 
     consistent with applicable law and policy, without impacting 
     the Office&#x27;s ability to gain timely situational awareness of 
     a covered cybersecurity incident or significant cyber 
     incident.
       ``(e) Disclosure, Retention, and Use of Incident Reports.--
       ``(1) Authorized activities.--No information provided to 
     the Office in accordance with subsections (d) or (h) may be 
     disclosed to, retained by, or used by any Federal department 
     or agency, or any component, officer, employee, or agent of 
     the Federal Government, except if the Director determines 
     such disclosure, retention, or use is necessary for--

     information about such incident by engaging directly such 
     covered entity in accordance with paragraph (2) to request 
     information about such incident, or, if the Director is 
     unable to obtain such information through such engagement, by 
     issuing a subpoena to such covered entity, subject to 
     paragraph (3), to gather information sufficient to determine 
     whether such incident is a covered cybersecurity incident, 
     and if so, whether additional action is warranted pursuant to 
     paragraph (4).
       ``(2) Initial request for information.--
       ``(A) In general.--If the Director has reason to believe, 
     whether through public reporting, intelligence gathering, or 
     other information in the Federal Government&#x27;s possession, 
     that a covered entity has experienced a cybersecurity 
     incident that may be a covered cybersecurity incident but did 
     not submit pursuant to subsection (d) to the Office a covered 
     cybersecurity incident report relating thereto, the Director 
     may request information from such covered entity to confirm 
     whether the cybersecurity incident at issue is a covered 
     cybersecurity incident, and determine whether further 
     examination into the details surrounding such incident are 
     warranted pursuant to paragraph (4).
       ``(B) Treatment.--Information provided to the Office in 
     response to a request under subparagraph (A) shall be treated 
     as if such information was submitted pursuant to the 
     reporting procedures established in accordance with 
     subsection (d).

       ``(A) In general.--If, after the date that is seven days 
     from the date on which the Director made a request for 
     information in paragraph (2), the Director has received no 
     response from the entity from which such information was 
     requested, or received an inadequate response, the Director 
     may issue to such entity a subpoena to compel disclosure of 
     information the Director considers necessary to determine 
     whether a covered cybersecurity incident has occurred and 
     assess potential impacts to national security, economic 
     security, or public health and safety, determine whether 
     further examination into the details surrounding such 
     incident are warranted pursuant to paragraph (4), and if so, 
     compel disclosure of such information as is necessary to 
     carry out activities described in subsection (c).

     with a subpoena, the Director may bring a civil action in a 
     district court of the United States to enforce such subpoena. 
     An action under this paragraph may be brought in the judicial 
     district in which the entity against which the action is 
     brought resides, is found, or does business. The court may 
     punish a failure to obey an order of the court to comply with 
     the subpoena as a contempt of court.

       ``(A) Examination.--If, based on the information provided 
     in response to a subpoena issued pursuant to paragraph (3), 
     the Director determines that the cybersecurity incident at 
     issue is a significant cyber incident, or is part of a group 
     of related cybersecurity incidents that together satisfy the 
     definition of a significant cyber incident, and a more 
     thorough examination of the details surrounding such incident 
     is warranted in order to carry out activities described in

     an examination of such incident in order to enhance the 
     Agency&#x27;s situational awareness of cybersecurity threats

     provided in response to a subpoena issued pursuant to 
     paragraph (3) or identified in the course of an examination 
     under subparagraph (A), that the facts relating to the 
     cybersecurity incident at issue may constitute grounds for a 
     regulatory enforcement action or criminal prosecution, the 
     Director may provide such information to the Attorney General 
     or the appropriate regulator, who may use such information 
     for a regulatory enforcement action or criminal prosecution.

     definition of covered cybersecurity incidents but may 
     nevertheless enhance the Agency&#x27;s situational awareness of 
     cybersecurity threats across critical infrastructure sectors.

     entity, and with respect to which such incident is likely to 
     undermine the security of such covered entity or cause 
     operational or reputational damage to such covered entity,

     covered entity and provide to such covered entity such 
     information regarding such incident as is necessary to enable 
     such covered entity to address any such security risk or 
     operational or reputational damage arising from such

          amendment no. 110 offered by mr. cohen of tennessee

       Add at the end of subtitle C of title XIII of division A 
     the following:

     SEC. ___. TRANSNATIONAL REPRESSION ACCOUNTABILITY AND 
                   PREVENTION.

       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
       (1) The International Criminal Police Organization 
     (INTERPOL) works to prevent and fight crime through enhanced 
     cooperation and innovation on police and security matters, 
     including kleptocracy, counterterrorism, cybercrime, 
     counternarcotics, and transnational organized crime.
       (2) United States membership and participation in INTERPOL 
     advances the national security and law enforcement interests 
     of the United States related to combating kleptocracy, 
     terrorism, cybercrime, narcotics, and transnational organized 
     crime.
       (3) Article 2 of INTERPOL&#x27;s Constitution states that the 
     organization aims ``[to] ensure and promote the widest 
     possible mutual assistance between all criminal police 
     authorities . . . in the spirit of the `Universal Declaration 
     of Human Rights&#x27; &#x27;&#x27;.
       (4) Article 3 of INTERPOL&#x27;s Constitution states that ``[i]t 
     is strictly forbidden for the Organization to undertake any 
     intervention or activities of a political, military, 
     religious or racial character&#x27;&#x27;.
       (5) These principles provide INTERPOL with a foundation 
     based on respect for human rights and avoidance of 
     politically motivated actions by the organization and its 
     members.
       (6) According to the Justice Manual of the United States 
     Department of Justice, ``[i]n the United States, national law 
     prohibits the arrest of the subject of a Red Notice issued by 
     another INTERPOL member country, based upon the notice 
     alone&#x27;&#x27;.
       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
     some INTERPOL member countries have repeatedly misused 
     INTERPOL&#x27;s databases and processes, including Notice and 
     Diffusion mechanisms, for activities of an overtly political 
     or other unlawful character and in violation of international 
     human rights standards, including making requests to harass 
     or persecute political opponents, human rights defenders, or 
     journalists.
       (c) Support for Interpol Institutional Reforms.--The 
     Attorney General and the Secretary of State shall--
       (1) use the voice, vote, and influence of the United 
     States, as appropriate, within INTERPOL&#x27;s General Assembly 
     and Executive Committee to promote reforms aimed at improving 
     the transparency of INTERPOL and ensuring its operation 
     consistent with its Constitution, particularly articles 2 and 
     3, and Rules on the Processing of Data, including--
       (A) supporting INTERPOL&#x27;s reforms enhancing the screening 
     process for Notices, Diffusions, and other INTERPOL 
     communications to ensure they comply with INTERPOL&#x27;s 
     Constitution and Rules on the Processing of Data (RPD);
       (B) supporting and strengthening INTERPOL&#x27;s coordination 
     with the Commission for Control of INTERPOL&#x27;s Files (CCF) in 
     cases in which INTERPOL or the CCF has determined that a 
     member country issued a Notice, Diffusion, or other INTERPOL 
     communication against an individual in violation of articles 
     2 or 3 of the INTERPOL Constitution, or the RPD, to prohibit 
     such member country from seeking the publication or issuance 
     of any subsequent Notices, Diffusions, or other INTERPOL 
     communication against the same individual based on the same 
     set of claims or facts;
       (C) increasing, to the extent practicable, dedicated 
     funding to the CCF and the Notices and Diffusions Task Force 
     in order to further expand operations related to the review 
     of requests for red notices and red diffusions;
       (D) supporting candidates for positions within INTERPOL&#x27;s 
     structures, including the Presidency, Executive Committee, 
     General Secretariat, and CCF who have demonstrated experience 
     relating to and respect for the rule of law;
       (E) seeking to require INTERPOL in its annual report to 
     provide a detailed account, disaggregated by member country 
     or entity of--
       (i) the number of Notice requests, disaggregated by color, 
     that it received;
       (ii) the number of Notice requests, disaggregated by color, 
     that it rejected;
       (iii) the category of violation identified in each instance 
     of a rejected Notice;
       (iv) the number of Diffusions that it cancelled without 
     reference to decisions by the CCF; and
       (v) the sources of all INTERPOL income during the reporting 
     period; and
       (F) supporting greater transparency by the CCF in its 
     annual report by providing a detailed account, disaggregated 
     by country, of--
       (i) the number of admissible requests for correction or 
     deletion of data received by the CCF regarding issued 
     Notices, Diffusions, and other INTERPOL communications; and
       (ii) the category of violation alleged in each such 
     complaint;
       (2) inform the INTERPOL General Secretariat about incidents 
     in which member countries abuse INTERPOL communications for 
     politically motivated or other unlawful purposes so that, as 
     appropriate, action can be taken by INTERPOL; and
       (3) request to censure member countries that repeatedly 
     abuse and misuse INTERPOL&#x27;s red notice and red diffusion 
     mechanisms, including restricting the access

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4913">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4913">H4913</a></a>]]

     of those countries to INTERPOL&#x27;s data and information 
     systems.

     State; Sanction for Breach or Official Misconduct.--A notary 
     public may not perform a notarization under section 6102 or

     creates or designates a class or type of commission or 
     appointment, or requires an endorsement or other 
     authorization to be received by a notary public, as a

     due to mission risk such as recovery issues or that are one-
     time-use unmanned aircraft system due to requirements and low 
     cost.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from Alabama 
(Mr. Rogers) each will control 15 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Let me express my deep appreciation to the committee 
and staff for helping us zero in on a couple of things that are 
longstanding interests of mine.
  One is an amendment requiring the Department of Defense to have a 
cost estimate and program evaluation for unexpected cost increases for 
the W80-40 nuclear warhead life extension program. I appreciate this 
giving us a little more information.

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4932">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4932">H4932</a></a>]]

  But I would like to focus on one particular area that has been deeply 
troubling me for years. I have, in the middle of the city of Portland, 
a Superfund site that people have been working on cleaning up the toxic 
residue of years. And one party has not been a part of this effort, the 
Department of Defense.
  The Department of Defense built and decommissioned battleships for 
World War I, World War II, and the Korean war in the heart of the city. 
We have been working on a hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars cleanup 
working with the private sector, working with individuals, with 
utilities, and local governments. The Federal Government has been 
missing in action.
  We found this last summer as we were starting some of the remedial 
cleanup. Over 400 shells were dug up, and still, the Department of 
Defense is missing in action, not taking responsibility for cleaning up 
the toxic legacy of military activities in my community and around the 
country.
  I have worked on this for years. I have been extraordinarily 
frustrated that the Department of Defense pushes this responsibility 
off. It is time to change. I appreciate what the committee has done. I 
hope this is a new era.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Madam Speaker, this is an en bloc that was put together in close 
consultation with the minority. I urge all Members to support it, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).
  Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member 
Rogers for their hard work on this bill.
  I have two amendments that have been added into this amendment. The 
first puts anticorruption at the core of U.S. foreign policy, 
reflecting the Biden administration&#x27;s declaration that corruption is a 
national security threat, and indeed it is.
  As the House chair of the bipartisan and bicameral Helsinki 
Commission, bipartisan foreign policy to promote human rights and 
counter corruption is deeply important to our group and to our Nation. 
Corruption is the fuel of human rights abuse, and dictatorship is the 
primary means by which dictators and their cronies influence government 
and society.
  Madam Speaker, I want to thank the large group of bipartisan 
colleagues who supported this amendment, many of whom are members of 
the Counter-Kleptocracy Caucus. A special thank-you to Representatives 
Malinowski and Salazar, whose Combating Global Corruption Act is also 
included in the amendment.
  The other amendment would require the Secretary of Defense to attempt 
to recover the Afghan aircraft that the U.S. provided to the Afghan 
Government and were flown out of the country by Afghan pilots fleeing 
the Taliban. These aircraft were purchased with U.S. tax dollars and 
should be returned to us. They are in Uzbekistan and other countries. I 
am sure the Taliban would like to get them back, but they should come 
back to the USA.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).
  Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I rise first in support of my amendment, 
the Gray Zone Assessment Act.
  Whether we look at the annexation of Crimea, the militarization of 
the South China Sea, the economic coercion of Australia, or the 
cyberattacks that have stolen our data and crippled our industries, we 
see the same pattern. Our adversaries are using methods of coercion 
that lie somewhere in the so-called gray zone, between war and peace.
  To make matters worse, thus far, we seem incapable of effectively 
responding to this aggression. It is well past time that we have a 
viable response.
  Experts have identified several causes for our failure to deter these 
gray zone campaigns--in particular, our weakness at coordinating all of 
our tools of national power by requiring the GAO to take a hard look at 
these problems. My amendment aims to move forward a process of reform 
that will enable us to effectively counter the shadow war that China, 
Russia, and others are waging against us and against the free world.
  I would also like to voice my support for Mr. Connolly&#x27;s amendment, 
No. 114, the Global Health Security Act. After 18 months of lockdowns, 
masks, social distancing, school closures, and, worst of all, a 
mounting death toll, COVID-19 has taught us that a disease that starts 
at the other side of the world can pose a direct national security 
threat right here in America.
  Back at the end of 2018, before COVID-19 even existed, Mr. Connolly 
and I recognized this threat and believed that Congress needed to 
support, direct, and provide oversight for our global health security 
work abroad.
  We introduced the bipartisan Global Health Security Act to strengthen 
the U.S. and global capacity to better respond to outbreaks like COVID-
19. Passing this amendment will help us be prepared for the next virus 
so that it does not become a pandemic like this one did.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I 
again thank the ranking member and the chair.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).
  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith and his team for 
including several important amendments to this year&#x27;s National Defense 
Authorization Act, and that includes my amendment that requires a 
report from the Department of Defense addressing instances where U.S. 
security assistance is given to foreign military units known to have 
committed gross human rights violations.
  This amendment specifically focuses on the section 333 Building 
Partner Capacity Program, which has sent enormous sums of American 
taxpayer dollars to authoritarian and human rights-abusing regimes.
  A prime example of the program&#x27;s problematic nature is the $100 
million given to Azerbaijani President Aliyev&#x27;s regime in fiscal years 
2018 and 2019. As Azerbaijan was still receiving equipment and training 
from the U.S. military, they began a deadly attack against Nagorno-
Karabakh, or Artsakh, on September 27, that led to the death of 
thousands and the displacement of so many more.
  Passage of this amendment sends a clear signal that the United States 
takes seriously its democratic norms and commitment to peace by 
ensuring oversight of our security assistance. I hope it leads to 
future restraint from aiding and tolerating similar regimes in the 
future, especially when their actions are aimed at destabilizing a 
fellow democracy.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. Pfluger), one of our outstanding freshmen.
  Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the 2022 
National Defense Authorization Act, and I applaud the efforts of 
Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers to bring this bipartisan bill 
to the floor.
  This bill boosts defense funding in line with the recommended 3 to 5 
percent real growth needed to maintain our competitive edge over China. 
The debacle in Afghanistan has weakened our position on the global 
stage and is a propaganda boon for our adversaries seeking to dismantle 
the democratic world order. There is no doubt that China and Russia are 
eyeing this opportunity to cast doubts on U.S. resolve and our 
commitments. It is imperative that we reassure our allies and partners 
of American strength at every turn.
  China is building its military and technological capabilities, and 
these investments will help achieve the next-generation joint fighting 
force, specifically of air and sea power.
  I am an F-22 pilot and have flown against some of the world&#x27;s most 
technologically advanced weapons systems. Now is the time that we need 
to take this seriously. Every threat around the world is looking at our 
vulnerabilities, and it is this body&#x27;s work that will help us maintain 
those competitive advantages.
  To meet these challenges head-on, we must fully embrace the whole-of-
government approach to counter any malign intentions.
  Congress is integral to this concept, and we must recognize these 
challenges and respond with strength at this time. We should not let 
perfect be the enemy

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4933">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4933">H4933</a></a>]]

of good, and we cannot delay this legislation at all. The strength of 
our military is at stake.
  The readiness and lethality that the warfighters so desperately need, 
which this bill includes, is absolutely imperative to making sure the 
United States can meet any challenges and defeat any enemy around the 
world.
  Madam Speaker, I urge passage of the underlying bill, and I look 
forward to ironing out our differences through the conference process.

                              {time}  1515

  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Correa).
  Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for all his hard 
work on the NDAA. I fully support this measure.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of en bloc 1 which includes 
my two amendments, amendment No. 29 that creates an Afghan refugee 
special envoy position and amendment No. 117 that requires the 
Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure that all women veterans 
receive quality healthcare in a safe and dignified manner and on a 
timely basis.
  The Afghan refugee position assures that our allies who fought 
alongside American soldiers for 20 years receive the support that they 
need to resettle in the United States and are integrated into our great 
Nation.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support amendments en bloc 1 
and to support my amendments, No. 29 and No. 117.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I have some more speakers who 
aren&#x27;t ready to speak right now, so at this time I reserve the balance 
of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Auchincloss).
  Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for including my 
two amendments so that we may learn from the mistakes of the forever 
wars and ensure the Taliban cannot benefit from our financial system.
  I served in Afghanistan&#x27;s Helmand Province. I saw what began as a 
counterterrorism mission mutate under President Bush into a $1 trillion 
boondoggle of a counterinsurgency.
  My first amendment ensures that Congress&#x27; Afghanistan Commission can 
access the classified documents behind the forever war and hold to 
account those decision makers who let the fallacy of sunk costs guide 
their continual investments of time, troops, and treasure into an 
unwinnable war.
  My second amendment directs the Treasury Department to closely 
monitor illicit financing flowing to the Taliban. This safeguards our 
financial system and ensures the Taliban can&#x27;t use it to finance 
terrorist activities. At the close of this war, we must move forward 
with the assurance that we will learn from history.
  Madam Speaker, to increase transparency and counter the Taliban, I 
urge adoption of this en bloc package.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. Chu).
  Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my two amendments 
to the NDAA to ensure the Pentagon pays attention to the most 
vulnerable, both within the ranks and within the theaters of war, where 
they operate.
  My first amendment is a response to the ongoing but still poorly 
understood problem of hazing in the military. For years, unchecked 
hazing has been eroding unit cohesion and troop morale. Too many, like 
my own nephew, Harry Lew, have died by suicide after having been 
mercilessly hazed by their fellow soldiers.
  Stopping this requires understanding the problem, which is why this 
amendment extends regular reports through 2027 on hazing and what the 
Pentagon is doing to address it.
  My second amendment is a response to the horrific August drone strike 
in Kabul that killed at least 10 civilians. This kind of mistake is 
inexcusable. These families can never get their loved ones back, but 
with just compensation they can begin to rebuild their lives. Accepting 
our responsibility is the bare minimum of what they deserve.
  Madam Speaker, I urge support of this en bloc package.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cammack), who is another outstanding 
freshman Member.
  Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Rogers, for 
yielding.
  Madam Speaker, my amendment No. 84 would require a report on the 
feasibility of establishing a Customs and Border Protection 
preclearance facility in Taiwan.
  Last year, Taipei International Airport applied to offer customs 
preclearance with strong support and calls for approval of their 
application on both sides of the Pacific.
  Taiwan would be the first country in East Asia to offer preclearance, 
an excellent choice given our close economic ties with the island, our 
shared values, and our ever-more critical security partnership.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to 
enhance travel between the United States and Taiwan.
  Secondarily, I rise in support of my amendment which would require 
the Secretary to conduct an anonymous survey to determine the effects 
of the COVID-19 vaccine mandate on both reenlistment and recruitment to 
the Armed Forces.
  I am not anti-vaccine, but I am 100 percent anti-mandate. Individuals 
should be able to choose what is best for them and their families in 
consultation with their doctors. They should not be forced to take a 
vaccine by government at any level.
  I believe my colleagues who are pro-vaccine mandates should support 
this amendment to determine what effects the mandate at DOD will have 
on both reenlistment and recruitment. We need to know what, if any, 
effect this policy will have on our national security and our 
readiness.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close at 
this time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I urge support of the 
amendments en bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I too urge support of the 
amendments en bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendments 
included in En Bloc No. 1. My first amendment, No. 100, would require 
DoD to develop more distributed military and Intelligence Community 
satellite architectures through a limitation of funds until Secretary 
of Defense certifies that the Secretary of Air Force is carrying out 
the program and the appropriate report on implementation is provided. 
His amendment was part of a China Task Force recommendation from last 
year that was dropped from the FY21 NDAA, despite its inclusion in the 
report. Section 1607 of the FY2020 NDAA mandated that the Secretary 
establish a program to prototype an M-code based, multi-global 
navigation satellite system receiver that is capable of receiving 
covered signals with the intent to increase the resilience and 
capability of military position and navigation equipment. This program 
would as a result deter the liklihood of attack on the worldwide Global 
Positioning System by reducing the benefits of such an attack. In last 
year&#x27;s annual report to congress, the ``Military and Security 
Developments involving the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;&#x27; highlighted PRC 
military strategists increasing development of capabilities that 
utilize space-based systems and to deny use of space-based systems to 
adversaries as central to modern warfare. The report further cites 
China&#x27;s strengthening of its military space capabilities despite its 
public stance against the militarization of space. This program is 
critical to countering the CCP&#x27;s intent to reduce U.S. competitive 
technological advantage in space. Just this spring, the DNI&#x27;s annual 
Threat Assessment highlighted the PRC&#x27;s advancing interests in 
advancements in the space domain, detailing China&#x27;s intent to continue 
to develop craft to intercept, capture, or destroy US satellites. 
Additionally, this past summer Director of Intelligence for Indo-
Pacific Command, Rear Adm. Studeman repeated similar concerns: ``From 
dazzling to jamming, to kinetic kill-from-the-ground, from space--all 
that, they&#x27;re on the march. They take a look at our space capability 
and want to equal and exceed those and be able to dominate to guarantee 
themselves the maneuvering they need to be able to secure their 
objectives if they&#x27;re in a fight.&#x27;&#x27; It is critical that as we further 
develop space-capabilities we

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4934">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4934">H4934</a></a>]]

do so by prioritizing resilience in these systems as our adversaries 
continue to develop technology to not just rival, but dominate our 
efforts in the space domain.
  My second amendment included in this En Bloc, No. 101, would prohibit 
the Secretary of the Interior from altering the designation of uranium 
as a critical mineral until a report assessing the effects of the loss 
of domestic uranium production. The Secretary of Defense, in 
coordination with the Secretaries of Energy and Commerce, are to 
conduct the assessment of the national security impact of removing 
uranium from the list and submit a follow-up report. The U.S. 
Geological Survey, which updates the critical minerals list every three 
years, published its revised methodology published in May noting that 
``Fuel minerals, including uranium, were explicitly excluded from 
consideration in this analysis.&#x27;&#x27; Removing uranium from this list, as 
the Biden Administration is proposing, is another effort to cave to the 
whims of environmental groups. The impact of this is not exclusive to 
national security. Domestic uranium production has almost completely 
idled and the source of uranium for our reactors has increasingly 
become foreign state-owned entities. Keeping it as a resource on the 
list will go a long way to restoring and securing American uranium 
production.
  Producing less energy at home means that we are forced to rely on our 
adversaries for these critical resources, emboldening them and 
weakening our global standing as they attempt to undermine our 
interests. U.S.-origin uranium is critical to national defense for the 
purpose of nuclear weapons and the naval fleet, providing propulsion 
for 11 aircraft carriers and 70 submarines. Many international nuclear 
cooperation agreements to which the United States is a party, restrict 
the use of nuclear material imported under those agreements to peaceful 
uses. The United States requires U.S.-origin uranium and nuclear 
technologies for use in the production of uranium-based products for 
U.S. defense systems, with no foreign obligations that restrict the 
uses of such nuclear material. At this time, there is only one 
functional enrichment facility in the United States despite employing 
three major defense systems that require highly-enriched uranium. 
Removing uranium from the critical minerals list would be a dangerous 
and misguided decision as it is a vital component to both our national 
security and energy security. We cannot continue to rely on unfriendly 
nations that leverage energy dominance for geopolitical influence. 
These amendments are important additions to the National Defense 
Authorization Act and highlight the diverse challenges to our national 
security. I am encouraged by their inclusion into En Bloc No. 1 and 
urge adoption into the final bill.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
Amendment No. 3, which directs the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) to reclassify public safety telecommunications officers, also 
called 911 dispatchers, as a protective service occupation in the U.S. 
Government&#x27;s Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system. This 
Amendment would have no direct effect on these workers&#x27; wages, 
benefits, or other resources; proponents of this reclassification have 
stated that it ``would provide validation.&#x27;&#x27;
  The SOC classification system is a federal statistical standard used 
across agencies in data collection. According to OMB, ``[t]he SOC is 
designed exclusively for statistical purposes.&#x27;&#x27; Changes to the codes 
affect multiple data sources frequently used by policymakers, 
researchers, and employers, including the American Community Survey, 
the nation&#x27;s largest household survey; the Current Population Survey 
(CPS), the key source of our monthly employment numbers; and the 
Occupational Employment Statistics (OES), the authoritative source of 
employment and wage information by occupation. These changes would 
undermine the intent and legitimacy of the SOC by deviating from the 
long-established process designed to ensure the objectivity and 
integrity statistical data classifications more broadly.
  A standing committee at OMB, the SOC Policy Committee (SOCPC), is 
responsible maintaining the accuracy of these codes using well-defined 
principles. The SOCPC undertakes a routine revision of the codes 
roughly once per decade; the process spans multiple years and 
``involves extensive background research, periods of public comment, 
review of comments, and implementation of revisions.&#x27;&#x27; During its 
latest revision, which began in early 2012 and was finalized in 2018, 
OMB specifically rejected comments requesting it reclassify 911 
dispatchers as directed in Amendment No. 3. In its response to public 
comments presented in the May 2014 Federal Register, the Obama 
Administration&#x27;s OMB explained it ``did not accept these 
recommendations based on Classification Principle 2, which states that 
workers are coded according to the work performed. The work performed 
is that of a dispatcher, not a first responder.&#x27;&#x27; In 2016, OMB declined 
a similar request for reclassification. Based on the principles OMB&#x27;s 
policy committee applies to determine SOC codes, 911 telephone 
dispatchers are already properly and accurately classified. This point 
was reiterated in communications with the Education and Labor Committee 
in 2021, explaining ``After an extensive technical review of the 
requested reclassification for 911 dispatchers, OMB, consistent with 
the recommendation of the Chief Statistician of the United States, 
decided not to make such an adjustment because it is inconsistent with 
the statistical purposes of the SOC.&#x27;&#x27;
  Furthermore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), in a written 
communication with the Education and Labor Committee on September 26, 
2021, reported that the change made by <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1175">H.R. 1175</a>, a bill identical to 
Amendment No. 3, would ``will introduce costly, unnecessary logistical 
and data interpretation delays and challenges affecting the quality of 
data.&#x27;&#x27; Moreover, changes outside of the routine revision process would 
undermine the goal of data continuity, limiting data sources&#x27; 
usefulness for their key purpose of statistical analysis; create 
precedent for disrupting the standard SOC revision process; and 
undermine the SOCPC&#x27;s authority as experts to apply the classification 
principles to determine what accuracy requires.
  Public safety telecommunications officers perform critical, 
challenging work. They deserve our honor and gratitude for their 
efforts. However, considering the many alternative ways policymakers 
could confer ``validation,&#x27;&#x27; as the proponents are seeking, there is 
little policy justification for this Amendment&#x27;s approach to achieving 
that goal. The SOC is not intended to rank or group occupations by 
education, credentials, earnings, benefits or any other user-defined 
indicator of status.
  In conclusion, mandating a change to a statistical code would not 
affect these workers&#x27; wages, benefits, or other resources--but it would 
disrupt data series continuity; require significant additional work for 
government agencies, researchers, employers, and others; and intervene 
in an official, routine government data-collection and statistical 
process.
  Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the National 
Defense Authorization Act (NDDA) and my bipartisan amendment which 
authorizes an increase of five million dollars for a pancreatic cancer 
early detection initiative (EDI) at the Department of Defense (DoD). I 
thank my colleagues, Rep. Eshoo and Rep. McKinley, for their support 
and leadership on this issue. Pancreatic cancer has the lowest survival 
rate of all major cancers--in large part due to lack of research in 
early detection. I believe we all agree that the patients, families, 
friends and loved ones suffering from this disease deserve greater 
support.
  My amendment will provide critical funding needed for more research 
and an early detection initiative (EDI) under the Congressionally 
Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP) at DoD. I am pleased that 
the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee has already appropriated 
fifteen million dollars for general pancreatic cancer research funding 
in this year&#x27;s funding legislation. While encouraging, we need to 
continue doing more.
  This issue has hit painfully close to home recently, as America lost 
giants to pancreatic cancer. Rep. John Lewis, our civil rights hero, 
passed away from pancreatic cancer only seven months after receiving 
his diagnosis. My good friend and colleague, Rep. Alcee Hastings, also 
passed from pancreatic cancer earlier this year. And, Americans lost a 
fighter for voting rights and women&#x27;s protection, Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg, to this deadly disease. We have lost too many loved ones and 
must do everything we can to save lives. It is unacceptable that, 
despite being the third leading cause of cancer-related death in our 
country, pancreatic cancer still does not have a dedicated early 
detection initiative. In fact, the lack of research in ways to detect 
pancreatic cancer early has led to devastating consequences: sixty-six 
percent of patients live less than one year following their diagnosis.
  If diagnosed early, the five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer 
patients is above eighty percent. However, if pancreatic cancer is 
detected late, the five-year survival rate drops to less than five 
percent. By failing to support our nation&#x27;s researchers with the means 
to find new ways to detect pancreatic cancer early, we are leaving 
America&#x27;s pancreatic cancer patients with few ways to detect this 
disease in time to extend the quality and duration of their lives.
  It&#x27;s important to note that persistent health care inequities and 
disparities for communities of color compound the devastation of 
pancreatic cancer and the effects of lack of early detection research. 
Unfortunately, Black people are more likely than their fellow Americans 
to get pancreatic cancer. In fact, the incidence rate for pancreatic 
cancer among Black Americans is twenty percent higher than any other 
racial demographic. This disease is more deadly for us: the pancreatic 
cancer death rate is seventeen percent higher for Black men than white 
men. Significant evidence demonstrates that these disproportionate 
levels of

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4935">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4935">H4935</a></a>]]

pancreatic cancer are in large part rooted in disparities in health 
care and access to tests and diagnostics. As a result, the lack of 
pancreatic cancer early detection research accelerates the racial 
unfairness in our health care system, with devastating consequences for 
minorities.
  At a time when our country is having a national conversation about 
the deep disparities in access to health care for Black and Brown 
people during a global pandemic, Congress must do everything within our 
power to improve health outcomes through research and treatment. 
Providing dedicated funding for early detection research at DoD will 
help fill a critical gap in our pancreatic cancer research and will 
help address the pancreatic cancer disparities for communities of 
color.
  I urge the House to support this amendment.
  Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment 
reaffirming the importance of the U.S. Israel alliance. At a time when 
the Middle East is in constant turmoil, the United States needs strong 
allies like Israel. Allies who are stable, dependent, and a force for 
good in the region. Effective foreign policy in the Middle East begins 
with an acknowledgment of Israel as one of our Nation&#x27;s strongest 
allies. As Israel continues to confront security challenges, 
particularly with Iran, it is in America&#x27;s national strategic interest 
to continue to offer security assistance to Israel. For nearly 75 
years, Israel has been a constant and stable ally in a region devoid of 
stability. With the rise of Iran, the Taliban, and China&#x27;s growing 
influence in the region, the United States and Israel must continue to 
stand together against these monstrous regimes. Since its creation in 
1948, Israel and the United States have been bonded together through 
our common values of freedom, prosperity, and constitutional norms. At 
a time when Israel is facing assaults and threats from tyrannical 
regimes, the United States Congress must send a strong, unflinching 
message that we remain united with our friends and allies just as we 
have for nearly 75 years. My amendment provides a full endorsement from 
the U.S. Congress on the importance of the United States-Israel 
relationship. We unequivocally stand with Israel.
  Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, in February of this year, more than two 
years after the cold-blooded murder of Washington Post journalist, and 
my constituent, Jamal Khashoggi, the Director of National Intelligence 
released a previously classified U.S. intelligence report.
  The report clearly stated: ``We assess that Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Crown 
Prince Muhammad bin Salman approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey to 
capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.&#x27;&#x27;
  It concluded that ``since 2017, the Crown Prince has had absolute 
control of the Kingdom&#x27;s security and intelligence organizations, 
making it highly unlikely that Saudi officials would have carried out 
an operation of this nature without the Crown Prince&#x27;s authorization.&#x27;&#x27;
  We&#x27;ve always known, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that Crown Prince 
Muhammad bin Salman directed the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi.
  We also know that this operation is part of a broad and ongoing 
effort to use violence to intimidate and silence dissidents abroad.
  Furthermore, we know that some of the killers of Jamal Khashoggi were 
trained in the United States, demonstrating an overwhelming need for 
reforms to our current arms sales processes and increased 
accountability.
  And yet, despite all this, Crown Prince MBS and Saudi Arabia have 
generally been shielded from accountability, especially by the previous 
administration, signaling this kind of abhorrent behavior was somehow 
ok, inviting further atrocities.
  That impunity ends with my amendment, based on the text of my bill, 
<a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1392">H.R. 1392</a>, the Protection of Saudi Dissidents Act of 2021, which passed 
the House with overwhelming bipartisan support earlier this year.
  This legislation is targeted and does four things, specifically:
  It limits arms exports to Saudi intelligence, internal security, or 
law enforcement entities if the President finds that Saudi Arabia has 
engaged in the following activities:
  Forced repatriation, intimidation, or killing of dissidents in other 
countries;
  The unjust imprisonment in Saudi Arabia of United States citizens or 
residents or the placing of travel restrictions on them or their family 
members;
  And the torture of detainees in the custody of the Government of 
Saudi Arabia.
  It requires the closure of one or more Saudi diplomatic facilities if 
the President finds that Saudi Arabia is using diplomatic or consular 
personnel to harass or harm Saudi nationals in the United States.
  It requires a report on whether Saudi Arabia has been engaged in a 
consistent pattern of acts of intimidation or harassment directed 
against individuals in the United States.
  And finally, it requires a report on whether the U.S. intelligence 
community fulfilled its duty to warn Jamal Khashoggi of threats to his 
life.
  In the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I worked closely with the 
Chairman and Ranking Member to improve this legislation as introduced, 
ensuring that this effort is bipartisan.
  This legislation has the support of dozens of human rights 
organizations, including the Committee to Protect Journalists, 
Reporters Without Borders, PEN America, Human Rights First, Human 
Rights Watch, Freedom Now, and many others.
  When we turn a blind eye to human rights abuses, we embolden friend 
and foe alike to continue to engage in these horrific violations.
  We must end this ``two-year pageant of impunity&#x27;&#x27; and finally hold 
Saudi Arabia accountable for their treatment of dissidents and those 
who stand up for human rights and against autocratic repression.
  Jamal Khashoggi was not the only one to face the brutality of the 
Saudi regime and is not the only one who would benefit from this 
legislation.
  I thank Chairman Meeks for his support on this amendment, and I ask 
my colleagues to join me in sending a message to human rights 
defenders, dissidents, and journalists worldwide and reaffirm the 
unshakeable American commitment to basic rights and freedoms.
  I ask you to join me in supporting adoption of this amendment.
  Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, more than 4.7 million people around the 
globe have died because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
  In fact, more people in the United States have died from COVID-19 
than they did from the 1918 flu pandemic--the previous worst pandemic 
to date.
  For a year and a half, our lives, and the lives of people around the 
world, were completely upended, supply chains disrupted, governments 
thrown into disarray. This emergency impacted every part of our lives 
and we were caught completely unprepared.
  We can&#x27;t afford to let that happen again.
  Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a dearth of leadership and 
strategy around U.S. planning for a global health security emergency.
  As we continue to try to emerge from the worst of COVID-19, we now 
understand just how important planning like this truly is.
  COVID-19 has underscored not only the need for a robust federal 
response to such a crisis, but also the importance of investing in 
global health security and pandemic preparedness around the world.
  Given the disruption this pandemic has caused, it&#x27;s clear that we 
need to consider global health security when we consider our national 
defense and security.
  This amendment will:
  Establish a Global Health Security Agenda Interagency Review Council 
overseen by the National Security Advisor and whose membership includes 
the heads of agencies relevant to carrying out the Global Health 
Security Agenda;
  Establish a United States Coordinator for Global Health Security 
responsible for coordinating the interagency response to a global 
health security emergency;
  Require the President to develop a global health security strategy 
with specific and measurable goals, benchmarks, and performance metrics 
that will improve U.S. leadership on global pandemic preparedness;
  And establish an international Fund for Global Health Security and 
Pandemic Preparedness.
  The text of this amendment is based on my bill <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/391">H.R. 391</a>, the Global 
Health Security Act, which passed the House earlier this year with 
broad bipartisan support--the fifth time that it has passed the House 
of Representatives.
  The original legislation was improved with amendments during 
committee markup. They:
  Updated the findings sections to reflect actions taken by the Biden 
Administration on global health security;
  Tasks the National Security Advisor with overseeing interagency 
review council established in the bill;
  Added the Department of the Treasury and ODNI to the council 
membership;
  And elevated participation on the council to heads of agencies.
  These edits were helpful suggestions from the Ranking Member and we 
were glad to incorporate them.
  We wrote this legislation long before the current pandemic and have 
adapted the text to incorporate lessons learned.
  I thank Representatives Chabot, Bera, Fitzpatrick, and Larsen for 
leading on the original bill with me, and for their support on this 
amendment.
  The Biden Administration has already committed to funding the Fund 
for Global Health Security and Pandemic Preparedness, and included it 
in their FY22 Presidential Budget Request.
  There is a similar, bipartisan effort in the Senate led by Senators 
Menendez and Risch, demonstrating the widespread support for bolstering 
global health security.

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4936">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4936">H4936</a></a>]]

  This is not a red or blue issue--this is an issue that impacts every 
single person on the planet.
  This legislation is endorsed by Modernizing Foreign Assistance 
Network (MFAN), the ONE Campaign, Pandemic Action Network, RESULTS VA, 
Right to Health Action and others. It is also supported by Centers for 
Disease Control and USAID.
  Global health crises are ongoing and increasing--it&#x27;s only a matter 
of time before the next one hits.
  Saving lives from the next global pandemic starts with investing in 
preparedness before it strikes.
  Diseases do not respect borders, and global health crises have 
immense security, economic, and humanitarian consequences.
  With this legislation, the United States can be a leader on 
preventing and responding to the next pandemic.
  It is past time this legislation become law.
  Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, this amendment would provide welcome 
accountability and transparency for our security cooperation training 
programs.
  It would require the Department of Defense and Department of State to 
review the participants in security cooperation training programs from 
the last ten years to determine if any of the participants were later 
designated by the United States Government as human rights abusers, 
terrorists, or military coup participants.
  The amendment would require such reporting be updated on an annual 
basis.
  And, finally, it would create a reporting requirement to Congress for 
any names submitted to the Departments by the Chair and Ranking Member 
of the armed services and foreign affairs committees.
  Earlier this year, it was reported that some of the members of the 
kill squad that murdered and dismembered Jamal Khashoggi were trained 
right here in the United States.
  This is not something we found out through congressional reporting 
requirements from the Department of Defense, Department of State or 
public admissions from private sector contractors.
  We found out because of reporting based on leaked documents.
  It has also been reported that at least seven of the individuals who 
helped assassinate the President of Haiti, Jovenel Moise, were trained 
by the United States military.
  The review and ongoing transparency required by this amendment would 
provide welcome oversight of U.S. security cooperation programs and 
ensure that our capacity building efforts are not working against 
American interests or values.
  Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer an amendment to 
the FY2022 National Defense Authorization Act which would provide a 
statutory framework for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management 
Program, or FedRAMP, which was established administratively in 2011.
  FedRAMP is a standardized approach to certifying and assessing in an 
ongoing manner the security of cloud computing technologies used across 
the federal government.
  FedRAMP seeks to reduce the redundancies of federal cloud migration 
by creating a ``certify once, reuse many times&#x27;&#x27; model for cloud 
products and services that provide a cost-effective, risk-based 
approach to cloud adoption.
  This amendment would codify the FedRAMP program and address many of 
the concerns raised by government and industry stakeholders.
  For more than four years, I have worked with administrations under 
both Democratic and Republican leadership, industry stakeholders, and 
my friends on the other side of the aisle to ensure that the 
legislative text behind this amendment makes needed improvements to the 
FedRAMP program, but also gives the program flexibility to grow and 
adopt to myriad future changes in cloud technologies.
  This amendment supports a critical need to keep our nation&#x27;s 
information secure in cloud environments. It is an improvement for 
agencies, for our private sector partners, and for taxpayers.
  Enabling the efficient and secure procurement of cloud computing 
technology is an important part of federal IT modernization efforts and 
essential to the federal government&#x27;s transition to a more virtual, but 
secure posture.
  The text behind this amendment has passed the House with bipartisan 
support three times in the span of a year. Once under suspension by 
voice vote in the 116th Congress, again as an amendment to the House 
National Defense Authorization Act for FY2021, and again as a 
standalone at the very beginning of the 117th Congress.
  I want to thank the Ranking Member of the Oversight Committee, Mr. 
Comer, for co-sponsoring this amendment with me.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith).
  The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman 
from Washington (Mr. Smith).
  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.


                 Amendment No. 25 Offered by Mr. Bowman

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
25 printed in part C of <a href="/congressional-report/117th-congress/house-report/125">House Report 117-125</a>.
  Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of subtitle C of title XII, add the following:

     SEC. 1229. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS TO MAINTAIN A UNITED 
                   STATES MILITARY PRESENCE IN SYRIA.

       None of the funds authorized to be appropriated or 
     otherwise made available to carry out this Act may be used to 
     maintain a United States military presence in Syria beginning 
     on the date that is 1 year after the date of the enactment of 
     this Act, except pursuant to a specific statutory 
     authorization enacted into law in accordance with the War 
     Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.).

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. Bowman) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.
  Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge support for my amendment that 
will take an important step towards restoring congressional war powers. 
This amendment will bring our unauthorized military presence in Syria 
to a long overdue debate in Congress so we can ultimately vote to 
authorize or reject military action.
  Members on both sides of the aisle have long recognized the 
Constitution and the War Powers Act of 1973 grant Congress the 
exclusive power to send our servicemen and -women into war.
  I represent parts of the Bronx and Westchester County, New York, and 
in my district I am humbled to represent so many veterans who have 
sacrificed so much for our country. Hundreds of thousands of brave men 
and women have spent years away from their families, missing precious 
moments in their families&#x27; lives. Many have seen their brothers and 
sisters in arms be injured and killed in battle. Many have suffered 
life-changing injuries themselves. Others have made the ultimate 
sacrifice. On a daily basis, more than 17 veterans die by suicide every 
single day. A study from Brown University&#x27;s Costs of War project 
estimates that more than 7,000 servicemembers have been killed in post-
9/11 operations, and a suicide epidemic has claimed more than 30,000 
Active Duty servicemembers and veterans.
  Given the unimaginable sacrifice our troops make for our country, we 
owe them the respect of holding a debate and a vote on deploying them 
into harm&#x27;s way. I hope that no one serving in this body would oppose 
honoring their service and their sacrifice by debating and voting on 
these life and death matters.
  We haven&#x27;t shown that respect in my view. Washington is known for 
military contractors lobbying for endless wars and a bloated Pentagon 
budget while our investments in schools, healthcare, and jobs at home 
are neglected. Our military footprint extends across dozens of 
countries far from public scrutiny and accountability. In Congress we 
find out about drone strikes after they occur in the news.
  My amendment--which I am honored to be joined by Representatives 
Khanna, DeFazio, Schakowsky, Tlaib, Levin, Cohen, and Ritchie Torres in 
offering--is a fundamental next step toward breaking that cycle.
  This is a question of war and peace that should be answered with a 
recorded vote in Congress.
  This amendment does not take a position on substantive Syria policy 
questions. It merely requires this body to follow the Constitution and 
hold a debate and vote to authorize military action. I hope that my 
colleagues will agree that our troops and the American people deserve 
to see this body

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4937">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4937">H4937</a></a>]]

hold that debate and then cast their vote.
  Under the last administration, President Trump made it clear that 
U.S. military troops in Syria were there to secure the oil, but an 
explicit authorization from Congress was never obtained for that 
purpose.
  I disagree with claims that the 2001 AUMF--which was about responding 
to the September 11 attacks--authorized our troops to engage in 
hostilities against these forces which nobody argues had anything to do 
with those attacks or to guard oil fields.
  My colleagues who believe that the President does not need specific 
authorization to deploy U.S. military forces to seize Syria&#x27;s oil in an 
unconstitutional war should just admit that to their constituents. They 
don&#x27;t care about the duty of Congress, the Constitution, or the War 
Powers Act.
  I agree with what President Biden said yesterday at the United 
Nations where he called for a new era of relentless diplomacy and that 
U.S. military power must be our tool of last resort, not our first, and 
should not be used as an answer to every problem we see around the 
world.
  One step in the right direction would be to restore war powers, which 
is the solution put forth in this amendment.
  After U.S. troops clashed with armed Syrian villagers last year, now-
senior Biden NSC advisor Brett McGurk wrote on Twitter last year that 
American soldiers with an ill-defined mission in Syria are forced to 
navigate roads controlled by Russian and Syrian regime forces. He said 
that this is too much to ask of our brave warriors.
  I agree. And that is why I am seeking a vote to show them the minimum 
respect of doing our constitutional duty and either authorizing a 
mission with clear goals and a timeline or bringing our troops home to 
their families.
  I honor and respect the incredible sacrifices made by our Kurdish 
allies. Nothing in this amendment supports abandoning the Kurdish 
people, nor do I personally support that. The current unauthorized U.S. 
military presence of indefinite duration is disrespectful to the 
Kurdish people as it does not provide them the clarity that they need 
to make their own sovereign decisions about how best to protect their 
people and advance their own interests.
  I want to have a transparent and vigorous debate in front of the 
American people on the role of the U.S. military in Syria.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of my 
amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from South Carolina is 
recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, as I begin, I was 
grateful to support the prior amendment that we just had by President 
Gerry Connolly and also Congressman Steve Chabot, but I oppose this 
particular amendment.
  U.S. troops are in Syria to fight ISIS. They were sent by President 
Barack Obama pursuant to the 2001 counterterrorism AUMF. The global war 
on terrorism is not over. It is moving, as we have sadly seen, the 
terrorist attack last week in New Zealand and as we see the terrorists 
who are coming across the southern border into the United States.

  For years we have worked with our partners on the ground to eliminate 
the caliphate. We must not leave them behind as they have been brave 
patriots and could be subject to murderous terrorists.
  This mission has been incredibly successful. However, the job is not 
done. The threat of ISIS against American families and our allies 
remains. The nations that have faced the most cross-border attacks are 
India with 60,000 deaths; Israel with--just this year, in the past 
couple of months--12,000 Iranian rockets by an attack by Hamas from 
Gaza; and, of course, in America 3,000 persons murdered on 9/11.
  Our continued presence on the ground is necessary to ensure the 
enduring defeat of ISIS and protecting American families by defeating 
terrorists overseas.
  This shortsighted amendment would prematurely cut short our presence 
in Syria. Our small force in Syria is incredibly effective and part of 
the global coalition to defeat ISIS. This is not the time for America 
to abandon our allies and partners in Syria in the global war on 
terrorism. None of us want our soldiers overseas longer than absolutely 
necessary, but forcing a withdrawal too soon only ensures we will have 
to return as we saw in Iraq when the troops were withdrawn too soon, 
and U.S. troops had to go in just a few years later to fight ISIS.

                              {time}  1530

  In my opinion, we are seeing this play out again, sadly, in 
Afghanistan as the country is a safe haven for Islamic extremists to 
provide for suicide bomber attacks on families in India, Israel, and 
America.
  We must avoid a similar situation in Syria. Withdrawals should be 
based on the defeat of ISIS, not an artificial timeline. We know the 
success of peace through strength, and we also know of failure by war 
through appeasement.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, 
although I would like to point out that I agree very much with my 
colleague from New York of the appreciation of our Kurdish allies.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. Bowman).
  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New

yeas and nays.

  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.


                 Amendment No. 26 Offered by Mr. Mfume

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
26 printed in part C of <a href="/congressional-report/117th-congress/house-report/125">House Report 117-125</a>.
  Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of subtitle E of title VIII, add the following 
     new section:

     SEC. 8__. MODIFICATIONS TO GOVERNMENTWIDE GOALS FOR SMALL 
                   BUSINESS CONCERNS.

       Section 15(g)(1)(A) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 
     644(g)(1)) is amended--
       (1) in clause (i), by striking ``23 percent&#x27;&#x27; and inserting 
     ``25 percent&#x27;&#x27;;
       (2) in clause (ii), by striking ``3 percent&#x27;&#x27; and inserting 
     ``4 percent&#x27;&#x27;;

     all that follows and inserting the following: ``at not less 
     than--

       ``(I) 11 percent of the total value of all prime contract 
     and subcontract awards for fiscal year 2022;

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Mfume) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland.
  Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Mfume-Neguse 
amendment which will codify Congress&#x27; support for small businesses 
across the country, particularly as it relates to this defense bill.
  This amendment increases the overall Federal contracting goal for 
eligible small businesses from 23 to 25 percent. But more specifically, 
the amendment also increases the Federal contracting subgoals in 
different areas.
  For example, for service-disabled veterans, who we always talk about 
and

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4938">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4938">H4938</a></a>]]

sometimes do something about, this is an important aspect of this 
amendment because, for service-disabled veterans, this increases the 
contracting goal from 3 to 4 percent, over a year or two.
  For qualified small businesses, it increases the Historically 
Underutilized Business Zone contracting goals from 3 to 4 percent.
  And for qualified women-owned and controlled businesses, it increases 
the contracting goals from 5 to 7 percent; which I think is significant 
for women-owned businesses and, as I said before, those disabled 
veteran businesses.
  For small businesses that are owned by socially-disadvantaged 
individuals, it increases the contracting goal to 15 percent, and it 
does that over 4 years incrementally.
  This is an extremely rare opportunity for us to do something in this 
particular bill about the people who are going to be benefiting from 
the bill and the people who have worked so hard in and out and around 
the defense industry who are small businesses in our country, veteran-
owned businesses, women-owned businesses, minority-owned businesses.
  And at the beginning and the end of the day, Madam Speaker, this is a 
simple amendment aimed at growing contracting opportunities for those 
categories. And again, this is not a mandate; these are goals, and we 
think they are very achievable.
  I would urge consideration, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is 
recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, though I agree with Mr. Mfume that we need 
to find ways to incentivize and encourage agencies to contract with 
small businesses, very much so, I do not believe this is the correct 
approach.
  This amendment, unfortunately, does not actually incentivize more 
contract with small businesses in a meaningful way. There are many 
underlying factors affecting the small business goaling numbers that 
must be addressed first before we raising the goals. We need more 
effective solutions to increasing contracting with small businesses.
  First, the amendment does not address the concern of small businesses 
leaving the Federal marketplace at a very rapid rate. In fact, the 
amendment only incentivizes more dollars go to small businesses, which 
can easily be achieved by awarding huge contracts to a handful of 
mature small businesses, which can arguably be viewed as flouting the 
purpose of the goals themselves. It does nothing to incentivize 
agencies to contract with a greater number of small businesses, which 
is critical to maintaining a healthy and competitive industrial base.
  Second, the Small Business Committee has taken several actions over 
the years to understand and address the problems of agencies 
overreporting their small business goals. This issue is still a work in 
progress. Some of these dollars purported to have gone to small 
businesses may have gone to large businesses, perhaps legally, likely 
legally. However, agencies are permitted to report all dollars as going 
to small businesses when this may not truly be the case.
  Similarly, issues with double counting of the goals continue to 
exist. Raising the goals won&#x27;t do enough--won&#x27;t really do anything to 
increase the transparency or accuracy as currently reported. We need to 
know whether the government is truly meeting its goals before we can 
consider raising them.
  Third, it may be simply be too premature to raise some of those goals 
my colleague proposes to raise. The government has never met its 
HUBzone goal, yet the amendment raises the goal from 3 to 4 percent, 
while the previous goals, as stated, have never been met.
  Similarly, with the women-owned small business goal, which has been 
met only a few times in nonconsecutive years, raising that as well does 
not seem it would have the result that we are seeking.
  Lastly, the SBA is undergoing some significant changes to its 
government contracting programs; namely, beginning to fully certify 
women-owned small businesses and service-disabled veteran-owned small 
businesses. These goaling numbers presumably capture awards made to 
firms that self-certified as women-owned, or service-disabled veteran-
owned. Once the SBA begins to start certifying firms and self-
certification is no longer an option, we should expect to see a 
correlative dip in these two goals since there will be less vendors for 
agencies to choose from. It may be prudent to wait and see the true 
picture of where the government stands on these goals, once these 
front-end certification programs are fully in place, rather than 
raising them now.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I would respectfully disagree with the 
gentleman in his opposition. There are a couple of things that I think 
are important to be pointed out.
  As the vice chair of the Small Business Committee of the House, I 
continue to hear the stories from women-owned businesses, veteran 
businesses, minority-owned businesses, and those that are socially and 
economically disadvantaged, that they want this; that they believe that 
if you increase these goals, things then will change.

  By the way, these goals are aspirational; that is why they are called 
goals. This is not a mandate; not saying that we are going to move 1 
year to another. It is all aspirational. And we believe it is the right 
thing to do; otherwise I don&#x27;t know what we go back and say to those 
different groups of individuals.
  Now, Republican and Democratic Members alike on this committee have 
heard over and over again about how we ought to do more; how we ought 
to push the government to actually do what it ought to be doing in many 
respects. But, again, this is an aspirational goal.
  These are very, very small increases. And as we talk about defense 
contracting and the ability of minority businesses, women-owned 
businesses and, even more importantly, as I have said before, service-
disabled veteran businesses to be able to compete with some real hope 
of being able to benefit. I would really urge passage of this 
amendment.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, in closing, although I very much share my 
colleague, Mr. Mfume&#x27;s goal and idea, conceptually, in seeing more 
contract dollars be awarded to small business, I do not believe this is 
the correct approach.
  As a member of the Small Business Committee&#x27;s Contracting and 
Infrastructure Subcommittee, I look forward to working with him, and 
certainly others, to address the underlying challenging our small 
businesses are facing in such contracting.
  I do not support this amendment, and I urge a ``no&#x27;&#x27; vote on the 
amendment.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Maryland has 1\1/2\ 
minutes remaining.
  Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I look forward to the gentleman, not only 
being on the committee, but agreeing and certainly offering the 
invitation to work together. My hope is that this passes; and, if it 
does, then I would extend to him the opportunity to do that, and I 
would join with him in doing that to make sure the already existing 
goals are achievable, and the aspirational goals really represent a ray 
of hope for these four groups.
  And I don&#x27;t favor one over another, except that it is hard for me to 
look at a service-disabled veteran who is trying to do business in a 
bill dealing with defense, and to be able to say, well, I am sorry, we 
just didn&#x27;t do it again.
  So I would close--I appreciate the gentleman&#x27;s opposition, although I 
don&#x27;t agree with it, and I would urge passage of this amendment, Madam 
Speaker.
  I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the

                 Amendment No. 28 Offered by Mr. Khanna

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
28 printed in part C of <a href="/congressional-report/117th-congress/house-report/125">House Report 117-125</a>.
  Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the appropriate place in subtitle C of title XIII, 
     insert the following:

     SEC. 13__. PROHIBITION ON SUPPORT OR MILITARY PARTICIPATION 
                   AGAINST THE HOUTHIS.

       (a) Prohibition Relating to Support.--None of the funds 
     authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made available by 
     this Act may be made available to provide the following forms 
     of United States support to Saudi-led coalition&#x27;s operations 
     against the Houthis in Yemen:
       (1) Sharing intelligence for the purpose of enabling 
     offensive coalition strikes.
       (2) Providing logistical support for coalition strikes, 
     including by providing maintenance or transferring spare 
     parts to coalition members flying warplanes engaged in anti-
     Houthi bombings.
       (b) Prohibition Relating to Military Participation.--None 
     of the funds authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made 
     available by this Act may be made available for any civilian 
     or military personnel of the Department of Defense to 
     command, coordinate, participate in the movement of, or 
     accompany the regular or irregular military forces of the 
     Saudi and United Arab Emirates-led coalition forces in 
     hostilities against the Houthis in Yemen or in situations in 
     which there exists an imminent threat that such coalition 
     forces become engaged in such hostilities, unless and until 
     the President has obtained specific statutory authorization, 
     in accordance with section 8(a) of the War Powers Resolution 
     (50 U.S.C. 1547(a)).
       (c) Rule of Construction.--The prohibitions under this 
     section may not be construed to apply with respect to United 
     States Armed Forces engaged in operations directed at al 
     Qaeda or associated forces.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.
  Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I rise to offer my amendment with Chairman 
Smith, with Chairman Schiff, and Representative Jayapal, to finally end 
the humanitarian disaster in Yemen that has been going on year after 
year.
  Our amendment would end all U.S. logistical support and transfer of 
spare parts for Saudi warplanes that are bombing Yemen; that are 
bombing schools; that are killing children; that are bombing civilians 
in the largest humanitarian crisis around the world.
  Now, this body passed the War Powers Resolution to say that we would 
not be aiding the Saudi offensive in Yemen. President Trump suspended 
the fueling of those planes, and President Biden made that policy 
formal.
  And yet, the Saudis have not listened. Yet, they have a blockade 
where, just last month, in August, in the Port of Hodeidah, no fuel was 
let in. They come and they tell the United States one thing: We are 
letting fuel in. They lie, again and again they lie.
  There is a reason the 9/11 families wanted transparency and the 
decommissioning of the reports. There is a reason there was outrage in 
all of this country when they brutally murdered Khashoggi.
  They need accountability, and we are not going to use taxpayer 
dollars to give them equipment for their planes to bomb Yemeni&#x27;s kids.
  Now of course the Houthis are to blame as well. No one says the 
Houthis are blameless. Of course they are to blame, and of course they 
have had human rights violations.
  But the point is, the United States should not be making this war 
continue by arming or by giving parts to the Saudis that end up 
facilitating the conflict or elongating the conflict and killing 
people. It is time for the Saudis to recognize what everyone 
recognizes, that they have lost in Yemen. It is time for them to end 
the blockade, and it is time for them to allow a peace process that has 
a ceasefire in Yemen and a civilian government, instead of trying to 
win this by force.
  So I hope that everyone who supported our amendment last time--it 
passed 240-185 in this body--Jake Sullivan, who is the National 
Security Council Adviser; Wendy Sherman, who is the Deputy Secretary of 
State; Rob Malley, who is the envoy to Iran, all supported it. So I 
hope the administration will support it this time, that it won&#x27;t get 
stripped out of conference; and that it will pass, and we will finally 
begin to end this war.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1545

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
the amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from South Carolina is 
recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, we are all concerned 
about the ongoing war in Yemen, including civilian casualties in the 
conflict with the Houthis murderously using civilians as human shields.
  The Iran-backed Houthis continue to launch indiscriminate attacks 
against the Saudi homeland, threatening Saudi civilians and more than 
70,000 American citizens residing in Saudi Arabia.
  These murderous attacks target civilians and civilian infrastructure, 
like the Abha International Airport, causing death, injury, and damage 
to property. This is an intentional targeting of civilians and is in no 
way a military target.
  The terrorist-supporting regime of Iran is using the Houthis as 
proxies in the ongoing global war on terrorism.
  We cannot forget the pain and suffering that the Houthis themselves 
have inflicted on the Yemeni citizens with the Houthi brutal 
subjugation and occupation.
  One-sided initiatives that restrict U.S. support for Saudi Arabia, in 
word or deed, only telegraph more vulnerability that will lead to 
further attacks by the Houthis. We know the success of peace through 
strength and the failure of war through appeasement.
  It is encouraging that, in recent weeks, the Biden administration&#x27;s 
messaging has focused strongly on the Houthis&#x27; intransigence in ending 
the conflict in Yemen, calling on the Houthis to agree to a 
comprehensive cease-fire immediately.
  We must stop terrorists overseas to protect our allies who are 
targeted by the terrorists. India has lost over 60,000 persons due to 
cross-border terrorism; Israel, this year, has had to face nearly 
12,000 rockets provided by Iran to the Hamas terrorists in Gaza; and, 
sadly, we noted the 20th anniversary of 3,000 Americans killed on 
September 11, 2001.
  We should be using our longstanding relationship with the Saudis to 
press them to take every possible precaution to prevent civilian 
casualties. For nearly a century, there has been a warm cultural, 
educational, military, and economic partnership with the people of 
Saudi Arabia.
  But this amendment is too far detached from the sad realities of the 
Houthi attacks across the border and in Yemen. The drones and rockets 
have been provided by the terrorist-sponsoring regime of Iran, which 
oppresses its citizens and defames the extraordinary heritage of 
Persia.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Schiff), the distinguished chair of the Intelligence 
Committee.
  Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Khanna 
amendment. I am very grateful to Representative Khanna for his 
leadership.
  Yemen and its people are suffering through a catastrophic tragedy. 
Sixteen million in Yemen are at risk of famine. This year alone, 
400,000 children may die from severe malnutrition made so much worse by 
the conflict raging there.
  Today, we have a powerful opportunity to help bring an end to this 
suffering by terminating the U.S. decision to provide military 
assistance to the Saudi Arabian coalition fueling Yemen&#x27;s civil war. 
Our participation in this suffering simply cannot continue. We cannot 
be a party to the death of children and innocent civilians.
  This is why I urge an emphatic ``yes&#x27;&#x27; in support of this amendment, 
to bring an end to the U.S. funding of the Saudi-led military campaign 
in Yemen.

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
reiterate and join, actually, with my colleagues to point out that it 
has been encouraging in recent weeks that the Biden administration has 
changed its messaging to strongly focus on the Houthis&#x27; intransigence 
in ending the conflict in Yemen and calling for the Houthis to agree to 
a comprehensive cease-fire immediately, as we also recognize, again, 
that we have had a 100-year relationship with the people of Saudi 
Arabia that has been so mutually beneficial for the people of Saudi 
Arabia, the United States, and our allies.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I will end with this. A year ago, this 
exact amendment passed this body 240-185. The war has only gotten 
worse. Saudi Arabia has not lived up to its commitment to lift the 
blockade. The Saudis have not lived up to their commitment to stop the 
offensive strikes.
  I hope that this amendment will pass with an even bigger majority 
this time, and I hope the people in the administration, who supported 
this amendment as private civilians, will support it in their current 
roles.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.
  Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on Meeks amendment No. 30.
  The facts are plain. Saudi Arabia and its partners have perpetuated a 
catastrophic and devastating military campaign in Yemen since 2015, 
with no end in sight and without regard to civilian casualties.
  Saudi Arabia&#x27;s brutal Yemen war has resulted in the world&#x27;s largest 
humanitarian crisis, pushed millions of Yemenis to starvation, and 
decimated Yemen&#x27;s civilian infrastructure.
  Although the frequency and the intensity of the Saudi military&#x27;s 
bombing campaign has decreased as it has engaged in efforts to end the 
war through international negotiations, unfortunately strikes resulting 
in civilian casualties have continued.
  Between January and March 2021, airstrike incidents causing civilian 
casualties in Yemen actually increased as compared to the previous 3-
month period at the end of 2020.
  On one such strike on March 7, 2021, Saudi aircraft bombed the 
residential areas in Sanaa for the first time in months, leaving four 
civilians injured.
  Later in March and into April, further strikes continued, striking 
transportation infrastructure, residential areas, and a marketplace, 
leaving dozens of civilians injured, including two children.
  The Biden administration took the important step earlier this year of 
suspending the deliveries of certain weapons to the Saudi military in 
response to this pattern of actions, as well as appointing veteran 
diplomat Tim Lenderking as Special Envoy to Yemen.
  However, despite these actions and repeated congressional statements 
and efforts, the Saudi air force has continued conducting strikes in 
Yemen that have resulted in civilian casualties using U.S. support.
  That is why I am introducing this amendment, with the support of 
Representatives Deutch and Lieu and Chairmen Smith and Schiff, to 
suspend U.S. sustainment and maintenance to Saudi air units conducting 
strikes that result in Yemeni civilian casualties.
  My amendment also requires a thorough set of reporting requirements 
to Congress on the extent and details of Saudi offensive air operations 
and civilian casualties.
  It also includes exceptions for necessary counterterrorism operations 
against al-Qaida and its affiliates, territorial air defense, and 
defense of U.S. personnel and facilities.
  Houthi militants and the Iranian military continue to launch 
explosive-laden drones and ballistic missiles into Saudi Arabia at 
civilian areas and infrastructure, including many areas

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4941">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4941">H4941</a></a>]]

where American civilians live and work.
  While we seek to urgently address the tragic toll of civilian 
casualties borne by Yemeni civilians as a result of the Saudi 
military&#x27;s expansive air campaign, we recognize that Saudi Arabia does 
have a right and a need to defend itself, which this amendment provides 
for.
  In short, by suspending ongoing sustainment and maintenance of Saudi 
aircraft shown to have conducted airstrikes resulting in civilian 
casualties, we take a critical and necessary step to ensuring the 
United States is not complicit in or supportive of this destructive, 
tragic war.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
the amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from South Carolina is 
recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition, 
with the great appreciation of our chairman,  Greg Meeks--great 
appreciation, even if I disagree.
  We are all concerned about the ongoing war in Yemen, including the 
civilian casualties in the conflict due to the Houthis using human 
shields.
  However, sadly, many are focused disproportionately on Saudi Arabia 
while the Iran-backed Houthis continue to terrorize the people of Yemen 
and launch intentional, indiscriminate attacks against the Saudi 
homeland of innocent civilians, where 70,000 Americans live and work.
  We need to be aware of how the rhetoric in America regarding Saudi 
Arabia and the Yemen war empowers the Houthis to engage in further 
aggression with the murderous, intentional attacks on Saudi citizens, 
using drones and rockets provided by the terrorist-sponsoring regime in 
Iran, which oppresses its citizens and defames the extraordinary 
heritage of Persia. Iran perpetuates the ongoing global war on 
terrorism.
  It is encouraging that, in recent weeks, the Biden administration&#x27;s 
messaging has strongly focused on the Houthis&#x27; intransigence in ending 
the conflict in Yemen, calling on the Houthis to agree to a 
comprehensive cease-fire immediately.
  Additionally, the President already announced his plan to end U.S. 
support for offensive operations in Yemen, including relevant arms 
sales.
  We should wait and see the results of this new policy before adding 
further legislative restrictions. We should be using our longstanding 
relationship with the Saudis to press them to take every precaution 
against civilian casualties. For nearly a century, there has been a 
warm cultural, educational, military, and economic partnership with the 
wonderful people of Saudi Arabia.
  While the amendment contains specified exceptions, it does not 
address the core challenge of trying to rehabilitate the U.S.-Saudi 
partnership while trying to improve Saudi actions with respect to 
civilian protections as Houthis murderously use human shields.
  I do not think this amendment helps protect our national security 
interests in the Middle East, nor will it measurably change Saudi 
actions. We should be standing for the success of peace through 
strength and not the failure of war through appeasement.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Deutch), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Middle East, 
North Africa and Global Counterterrorism of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has only 1\1/2\ 
minutes remaining.
  Mr. MEEKS. I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Deutch).
  Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of Chairman Meeks&#x27; 
amendment, which would clarify and advance the administration&#x27;s January 
decision to suspend offensive support for the Saudi-led coalition&#x27;s 
operations in Yemen.
  The crisis in Yemen continues to devastate innocent civilians who 
suffer at the hands of Houthi assaults, coalition airstrikes, and a de 
facto blockade that hinders the transit of necessary goods, like food, 
fuel, and medicine.
  The war in Yemen will not be solved by military operations. The 
parties must commit to political negotiations to end this conflict. But 
as military operations continue, it is critical that the United States 
does not play a role in supporting further civilian bloodshed.
  This amendment requires the Department of State and Department of 
Defense to ascertain whether any coalition strikes resulted in civilian 
casualties and, in turn, suspend U.S. support and maintenance to those 
units.
  The House voted overwhelmingly to end U.S. support for the Saudi 
coalition&#x27;s offensive, and it is imperative that we follow through on 
that promise while ensuring that we protect the vital interests of the 
United States.
  We cannot allow human suffering in Yemen to continue unabated. 
Children are starving. COVID is raging. Enough is enough.
  Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Meeks for his leadership, and I urge 
support for this amendment.
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I will disagree with 
Chairman Ted Deutch. Usually, we agree.
  Additionally, I disagree with Chairman  Greg Meeks, but I do 
appreciate the chairman&#x27;s recognition of the Iranian and Houthi drone 
attacks on civilian communities where large numbers of Americans live.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote for this 
amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1600

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) and a Member 
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
support of this amendment, which contains my bill to increase 
transparency and accountability of senior leaders in the executive 
branch, called the Periodically Listing Updates to Management Act or 
PLUM Act.
  This bill would require the Office of Personnel Management to 
maintain a current publicly available online directory of senior 
government leaders.
  Currently, a comprehensive list of people appointed by the President 
is available only once every four years in a publication referred to as 
the Plum Book.
  The Plum Book provides only a snapshot in time and does not reflect 
changes that occur between publications. As a result, current 
information about senior administration officials is often outdated and 
difficult to find. In the digital age, providing Americans with a list 
of top Federal officials once every four years is simply unacceptable.
  This bill would implement recommendations made by the Government 
Accountability Office and the Administrative Conference of the United 
States by modernizing and expanding the current publication of the Plum 
Book and aligning it with modern data standards.
  The Committee on Oversight and Reform considered this bill in June of 
this year, and it was approved on a voice vote.
  The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee 
approved a similar bill last Congress with broad bipartisan support, 
and the PLUM Act has been strongly endorsed by a bipartisan group of 
more than two dozen civil society organizations and experts.
  I want to thank my cosponsors on the bill: Representatives Connolly, 
Sarbanes, Norton, Mfume, and Castro.
  I also want to thank my colleague, Representative Ocasio-Cortez for 
introducing the Political Appointments Inclusion and Diversity Act, 
which requires OPM to coordinate with the White House to make a summary 
of demographic information on political appointees publicly available. 
The requirements in her bill are included in the PLUM Act.
  We should be working together and working toward making our 
government more transparent for the American people and more 
representative of everyone in our country. The PLUM Act would provide 
timely and transparent information about senior government officials 
who are making decisions impacting the lives of millions. It would 
shine a light on who is at the table in our government and who is not.
  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to amendment 35, and 
I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  The amendment would establish an online public directory of political 
appointees at the Office of Personnel Management.
  I want to thank Ranking Member Rogers for his extraordinary 
leadership throughout this process. I want to echo his words from his 
opening testimony on Monday before the House Rules Committee where he 
urged the committee to ``keep out superfluous amendments that are not 
related to the Department of Defense.&#x27;&#x27;
  Unfortunately, this advice fell upon deaf ears with regard to this 
particular amendment. This politically charged amendment is wholly 
outside HASC&#x27;s jurisdiction. It does not belong in the NDAA.
  This lies solely within the jurisdiction of the House Oversight and 
Reform Committee, and the reasoning as to why we are debating this as a 
measure in the NDAA is absolutely beyond me.
  The Plum Book is already available online, and as of 2012 has already 
been published in a more searchable and accessible format. Given that 
the Plum Book is already accessible online in two separate locations, 
there is no justification whatsoever for the measure&#x27;s authorization 
for $7 million in appropriated taxpayer money to build this new online 
database.
  This amendment goes beyond the original intent of the Plum Book by 
creating a continuously updated website listing thousands of political 
appointees and senior government officials, which may dissuade good 
people from serving in future Presidential administrations and risk 
abuse by enabling political targeting.
  A tool that is updated monthly is not a transitional resource between 
administrations but, rather, a database that can be readily exploited 
by political activists to track down and target politically appointed 
leaders.
  Political appointees are already accountable to the duly elected 
President whom they serve, and the President, of course, is accountable 
to the American people every 4 years and to Congress each day of his or 
her term.
  Even more concerning is requiring the OPM Director to publish a 
report containing information on any appointee&#x27;s demographics, 
including self-identified data on race, ethnicity, Tribal affiliation, 
gender, disability, sexual orientation, veteran status, and whether the 
appointee is over the age of 40.
  Although the bill language claims to make the information anonymous, 
the mere fact that OPM would be in possession of this personal 
information, which is utterly unrelated and immaterial to the position 
to which the person is being appointed, could have a chilling effect on 
future political appointees.
  Additionally, there appear to be no safeguards in this amendment 
protecting this personal information from subsequent disclosure, 
whether through a FOIA request or a cyber

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4944">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4944">H4944</a></a>]]

breach. We have already seen during this Congress the multiple cyber 
breaches at various Federal agencies.

  If we can&#x27;t secure the information collected by the Federal 
Government, then the government shouldn&#x27;t be in possession of that 
information to begin with.
  This provision in and of itself is egregious.
  Transparency and accountability are essential to our constitutional 
government, but this amendment neglects the necessary safeguards to 
protect Federal employees.
  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues, what protections are in the PLUM 
Act to ensure that the database cannot be abused by activists to target 
and harass public officials?
  What protections exist in this amendment to protect officials who are 
serving in sensitive, national security positions?
  Why is it truly necessary, given that political appointees are 
already accountable to the public through their service under an 
elected President?
  Don&#x27;t you agree that this sensitive, private information this 
amendment seeks is not appropriate for the government to be collecting 
from our civil servants?
  Shouldn&#x27;t we instead be concerned about the effectiveness of our 
government leadership?
  This amendment is a slippery slope to requiring, collecting, and 
publishing the same information about our broader Federal workforce.
  Until these questions can be answered with sound policy, and our 
Federal agencies can guarantee the cybersecurity and other security of 
this information, I urge my colleagues to oppose this nongermane 
amendment.
  I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say 
that I disagree with the gentleman strongly. We need to move into the 
modern age. Right now all information is on the internet. It is digital 
and it is available. The bill would merely require the Office of 
Personnel Management to maintain a current, publicly available, online 
directory of senior government officials so that anyone could access it 
at any time.
  A comprehensive list is already out there, as you said, but it is 
printed only once every four years in a book that is called the Plum 
Book, and it is only a snapshot. It is not up to date.
  This bill is about modernizing the Plum Book and aligning it to 
modern data standards. That is what this is about.
  Information on senior leaders in government may already be obtained 
by outside groups through FOIA, freedom of information requests, or 
paid subscription services. There are paid subscription services, and 
you can get it through a freedom of information. So it is available.
  OPM civil service regulations stipulate that certain information from 
personnel records for current and former Federal employees is available 
to the public, including names, present and past position titles, 
salaries, position descriptions, and duty stations.
  Federal employees generally have no expectation of privacy regarding 
this information. It is available on all of us. It is available by 
private means, it is available through other means, through the FOIA, 
so why not make it available and easily used by the public?
  I want to answer the gentleman&#x27;s claim that identifying appointees 
publicly puts them at risk of political demonstrations or may make them 
not want to serve or whatever. He mentioned that this was a negative.
  My time is running out, but right now there is an exception for 
national security positions that is recognized and reporting on 
demographic information is important to get to the public, too.
  I strongly support this bill.
  I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would just urge opposition to 
this nongermane, intrusive, and overreaching amendment.
  I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2043">H.R. 2043</a>&#x27;s 
inclusion in the National Defense Authorization Act.
  I want to thank the distinguished Chairwoman of the Committee on 
Oversight and Reform for working with Mr. Sarbanes and me to improve 
the bicameral Periodically Listing Updates to Management (PLUM) Act.
  And I want to thank Mr. Smith for including this provision in the 
NDAA.
  This provision builds on my previous efforts to make government more 
transparent and accountable.
  This provision seeks to update and modernize the ``Plum Book,&#x27;&#x27; which 
is a publication that includes a comprehensive list of positions 
appointed by the president and the individuals who hold those 
positions.
  Because it is published every four years, the Plum Book provides only 
a snapshot in time and does not reflect changes that occur between 
publications. The publication, therefore, is almost immediately 
outdated.
  Moreover, it is often inaccurate, listing positions that no longer 
exist in government or missing newly-established ones.
  To provide more timely, transparent, and accurate information, the 
PLUM Act provisions would require: the Office of Personnel Management 
(OPM) to develop and maintain a publicly accessible website with data 
on senior leaders in government that meets modem data standards; all 
federal agencies to share data on senior officials with OPM; and OPM to 
coordinate with the White House every six months to confirm that 
information is complete, accurate, reliable, and up to date.
  Information on senior leaders in government is already available--
although you have to make a Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, 
request to get it.
  OPM civil service regulations stipulate that certain information from 
personnel records for current and former federal employees be available 
to the public, including names, present and past position titles, 
salaries, position descriptions, and duty stations.
  The people we serve have a right to know who is serving them. And 
they should not have to file endless information requests to get that 
information.
  And OPM guidance already provides exceptions to the release of the 
names of individuals in sensitive national security positions.
  The bill also begins federal efforts to track the demographics of our 
senior leaders in federal government.
  It also allows individuals to opt out of providing such demographic 
data. So no potential applicant will be forced to share their 
demographic information. It&#x27;s voluntary and helps us determine whether 
our nation&#x27;s leadership reflects the population it serves.
  The PLUM Act is about promoting accountability in our federal 
government leaders. And it already strikes the right balance between 
privacy and transparency.
  In the 116th Congress, the PLUM Act was favorably reported out of the 
House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Senate Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. This Congress, it&#x27;s time 
for enactment.
  The PLUM Act implements Government Accountability Office 
recommendations, and is endorsed by 24 bipartisan organizations and 
experts.
  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation and urge its 
inclusion in the NDAA.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Cuellar). Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 
667</a>, the previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.
  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my 
bipartisan amendment to end the Defense Department&#x27;s militarization of 
police departments across the Nation.

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4946">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4946">H4946</a></a>]]

  I think we can all agree that community confidence in law enforcement 
is at an all-time low, and a huge factor in this loss of confidence is 
the militarization of our police departments across the Nation.
  This trend has been exacerbated by the 1033 program that creates a 
pipeline to transfer surplus military weapons from war zones directly 
to domestic law enforcement agencies.
  These law enforcement agencies, without consent of the civilian 
authorities, obtain military grade weaponry directly from the war zones 
of Iraq and Afghanistan, and it is the civilian authorities who should 
decide whether such equipment is needed, not the law enforcement 
agencies themselves.
  The approval of city councils, county commissions, and other civilian 
authorities is bypassed under the 1033 program, and this amendment 
would fix that. It would stop law enforcement agencies from acquiring 
military-grade weaponry without the consent of the governed.
  They oftentimes have no need for these weapons of war, nor are they 
trained as to how and when to use the equipment, but a requirement in 
the 1033 program mandates that the acquired equipment be placed into 
use within 12 months of acquisition. This mandate has resulted in the 
misuse of the equipment and abuse of civilians against whom it was 
used.
  The result has been communities alienated and a loss of confidence in 
law enforcement. Momentum is building toward reform of the 1033 
program. American communities are not and should not be turned into 
battlefields, and people in those communities should not be looked at 
as enemy combatants.
  The ending of the war in Afghanistan makes it even more important 
than ever that we close down this pipeline of military-grade weapons 
from foreign war zones to the streets of our Nation.
  Over 17,000 pieces of military equipment have been declared excess or 
surplus and sent to the Defense Logistics Agency for distribution on 
our streets.
  The time is now to act, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes&#x27;&#x27; on 
my amendment.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1615

  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized for 
5 minutes.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.
  I fully support our law enforcement community, and particularly those 
in small and rural communities like those that pepper my entire 
congressional district. Those are the ones that benefit the most from 
the 1033 program.
  Limiting military equipment transfers would significantly impede 
their ability to do their jobs to keep us safe. We need to be 
supporting our law enforcement community, not making their missions 
more difficult.
  For that reason I oppose this amendment and urge a ``no&#x27;&#x27; vote, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, a small law enforcement agency 
being able to order massive amounts of military equipment directly from 
the battlefields of this country and to do it without consent of the 
governed is wrong, and that is what this amendment will get at.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. C. Scott Franklin), my friend and 
colleague, and a great member of the Armed Services Committee.
  Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from Alabama for yielding me time to speak on the importance of section 
1033 of the military surplus program.
  My Democratic colleagues frequently argue the 1033 program exists to 
militarize our police by providing lethal equipment. They claim the 
program transfers weapons of war to the police. They continue to 
perpetuate this misleading narrative to advance their dangerous crusade 
against law enforcement.
  Mr. Speaker, I have spoken with law enforcement in my district. The 
1033 program has helped them acquire a number of needed pieces of 
equipment, including heavy rescue vehicles.
  In 2015, a perpetrator in Polk County, Florida, my home district, 
wearing a bulletproof vest infiltrated a police line and had a shootout 
with our SWAT team. He had a stockpile of weapons, including AR-15s and 
AK-47s, and he used them to fire 93 rounds at deputies attempting to 
take him into custody. Sadly, John Mikula, a Polk County EMT, was shot 
and injured during the shootout.
  If not for this armored SWAT military surplus vehicle acquired 
through the 1033 program, more deputies might have been injured or 
killed.
  The 1033 program provides law enforcement agencies with needed heavy-
duty equipment at little to no cost.
  It is taxpayer friendly and efficient to recycle, reuse, and extend 
the life of equipment bought by taxpayers. It would be wasteful to 
simply discard this gear.
  Many of the types of vehicles are also used during hurricane recovery 
to rescue stranded citizens. The 1033 program also provides tents, 
generators, and air conditioners that are used for natural disaster 
field facilities.
  Mr. Speaker, I am a military veteran and familiar with weapons of 
war. I have never seen rescue vehicles, tents, generators, or air 
conditioners used or referred to as weapons of war.
  Our law enforcement agencies use the 1033 program to acquire 
equipment that protects our officers and serves our communities.
  This amendment is another ridiculous amendment to defund and 
undermine the men and women who protect us and put their lives on the 
line.
  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, rather than defund police, this 
amendment restores civilian authority over law enforcement.
  And I will submit to you that a small law enforcement agency doesn&#x27;t 
need a military-grade tank to rescue stranded individuals due to a 
hurricane or something like that, some kind of a natural disaster. You 
don&#x27;t need a military tank to do that.
  And no law enforcement agency should be able to order that equipment 
directly from the battlefield without the consent of the governed.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford), my good friend and a former 
sheriff.
  Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Alabama for 
yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment, which would 
unnecessarily restrict the Department of Defense from transferring 
surplus equipment to local, State, and Federal law enforcement 
agencies.
  We all remember the tragic Pulse nightclub shooting in my home State 
of Florida.
  During their response, law enforcement officers set off a controlled 
explosion to distract the shooter and used an armored vehicle to breach 
the walls of the nightclub to gain entry.
  One of the entry officers was literally shot in the head, but his 
life was saved by his antiballistic helmet. Now, I believe had the 
gentleman across the aisle been an entry officer that night, he might 
have a different opinion on the equipment that is necessary at those 
scenes.
  Under this amendment, those officers would not have had the 
explosives, the armored vehicle, or the antiballistic helmet to save 
their lives and many more lives that night.

  This program works to get our law enforcement officers what they need 
to protect themselves and to protect our communities. I always promised 
my community that our law enforcement officers would be men and women 
of character, well equipped, properly deployed, and skillfully managed. 
The 1033 program helps achieve that goal with significant reductions of 
cost to hardworking taxpayers. We must not take that away. I urge a 
``no&#x27;&#x27; vote.
  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, a large metropolitan law 
enforcement agency with the consent of the governed has the ability to 
purchase whatever equipment they need, but the bottom line is the 
civilian authorities get to decide, and the taxpayers pay for it.

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4947">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4947">H4947</a></a>]]

  But there should not be a supply line directly from the battlefield 
to a local law enforcement agency without consent of the governed and 
with the governed having to bear the cost of unnecessary equipment, as 
well as its misuse that contributes to the decline and confidence in 
law enforcement.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Nehls), another outstanding freshman.
  Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment. If 
passed, this amendment would greatly restrict law enforcement officer 
agencies throughout the country from obtaining lifesaving surplus 
military equipment like the OH-58 helicopter, and utility trucks, like 
the Humvee.
  When I was sheriff of Fort Bend County, Texas, if I had to comply 
with this amendment, it would have limited my ability to save lives.
  The 1033 program allowed me to obtain two surplus Army OH-58 
helicopters saving county taxpayers thousands of dollars. They were 
free. Additionally, the program provided replacement parts to keep them 
flying at no cost.
  After taking possession, we equipped them with lifesaving equipment 
and painted them with our department colors so everyone could see who 
was flying the helicopter.
  The idea of saying we are militarizing our police departments, this 
is what the OH-58 looked like. This is me in Kentucky picking it up. 
Six weeks later, this is what they looked like. Does that look like a 
military helicopter? Absolutely not. So that argument holds no water.
  In addition, county, city councils, and commissioners court must 
approve that equipment. It is not a rogue police chief; you must 
approve the equipment.
  On several occasions, my department responded to silver alerts where 
senior adults were missing and couldn&#x27;t be found. We deployed our 
helicopters to help search for them, and we were successful in many 
cases. And sadly, sir, some we were too late.
  During Hurricane Harvey and other events, we used Humvees received 
out of Fort Hood to rescue hundreds of families stranded in high water. 
The typical law enforcement vehicle doesn&#x27;t have the ability to forge 
through this high water where Humvees can, even up to 5 feet, and I 
have the pictures to prove it.
  If the amendment passes, folks, you will be restricting law 
enforcement agencies from receiving this lifesaving equipment. I know 
the benefits of the program, because I participated in it. It works, 
and I respectfully ask Members to reject this amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. 
Rogers) has expired.
  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, a pig with lipstick is still a 
pig, and a military-grade helicopter secured from the battlefields of 
Afghanistan is still a military-grade helicopter being used against the 
citizens.
  Now, if the gentleman&#x27;s jurisdiction, the city council or the county 
commissioner agreed to purchase and voted on that, agreed to accept the 
material, then that is good, but that is not required under the 1033 
program, which allows law enforcement agencies to petition directly to 
the Department of Defense and get this equipment like those helicopters 
without the consent of the governed. And that is wrong.
  Over the last several decades, the 1033 program has transferred more 
than $7.4 billion in surplus military equipment to over 8,000 Federal, 
Tribal, State, and local law enforcement agencies across the country.
  When I first introduced this language in 2014, I have heard every 
single excuse why we should not do something about this program, but it 
needs to end. The militarization of our police departments needs to end 
so that we can begin the process of restoring confidence in law 
enforcement.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).
  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. Johnson).
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appear to have it.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and 
nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/8">House Resolution 
8</a>, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.


               Amendment No. 38 Offered by Mr. Garamendi

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
38 printed in part C of <a href="/congressional-report/117th-congress/house-report/125">House Report 117-125</a>.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:
       Add at the end of title XVI the following new subtitle:

                     Subtitle F--Ballistic Missiles

     SEC. 1661. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds the following:
       (1) According to the Congressional Budget Office, the 
     projected cost to sustain and modernize the United States 
     nuclear arsenal, as of 2017, ``is $1.2 trillion in 2017 
     dollars over the 2017-2046 period: more than $800 billion to 
     operate and sustain (that is, incrementally upgrade) nuclear 
     forces and about $400 billion to modernize them&#x27;&#x27;. With 
     inflation, the cost rises to $1,700,000,000,000 and does not 
     include the cost of the additional nuclear capabilities 
     proposed in the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review.
       (2) The Government Accountability Office found in July 2020 
     that the Department of Defense and the National Nuclear 
     Security Administration have still not taken meaningful steps 
     to address affordability concerns or heeded the Government 
     Accountability Office&#x27;s recommendation to consider 
     ``deferring the start of or cancelling specific modernization 
     programs&#x27;&#x27;, including the W87-1 warhead modification program, 
     to address increases in the weapons activities budget 
     requests of the National Nuclear Security Administration.
       (3) The ground-based strategic deterrent program is 
     expected to cost between $93,100,000,000 and $95,800,000,000 
     which does not include the cost of the W87-1 warhead 
     modification program or the cost to produce new plutonium 
     pits for the warhead. The total estimated life cycle cost of 
     the ground based strategic deterrent program is 
     $264,000,000,000, and the program is intended to replace 400 
     deployed Minuteman III missiles with more than 600 new 
     missiles, to allow for test flights and spares.
       (4) The Air Force awarded a sole-source contract to 
     Northrop Grumman for the engineering and manufacturing 
     component of the ground-based strategic deterrent program in 
     September 2020, raising concerns that the absence of 
     competition for the award may result in higher than projected 
     costs to United States taxpayers.
       (5) The National Nuclear Security Administration is also in 
     the early stages of developing a replacement intercontinental 
     ballistic missile warhead, the W87-1, and expanding plutonium 
     pit production to build new warhead cores, costing at least 
     $12,000,000,000 and $9,000,000,000, respectively, to meet the 
     modernization needs of the ground-based strategic deterrent 
     program.
       (6) Maintaining and updating the current Minuteman III 
     missiles is possible for multiple decades and, according to 
     the Congressional Budget Office, through 2036 this would cost 
     $37,000,000,000 less in 2017 dollars than developing and 
     deploying the ground-based strategic deterrent program.
       (7) On April 3, 2019, Lieutenant General Richard M. Clark, 
     then-Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Deterrence 
     and Nuclear Integration, noted in testimony before the 
     Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives 
     that we have ``one more opportunity&#x27;&#x27; to conduct life 
     extension on the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic 
     missile, indicating the technical feasibility of extending 
     the Minuteman III missile despite his stated preference for 
     the ground-based strategic deterrent.
       (8) Even in the absence of an intercontinental ballistic 
     missile leg of the triad, the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review 
     signaled that the United States would have an assured 
     retaliatory capability in the form of ballistic missile 
     submarines, which are, ``at present, virtually undetectable, 
     and there are no known, near-term credible threats to the 
     survivability of the [ballistic missile submarine] force&#x27;&#x27;, a 
     benefit that will be enhanced as the Department of Defense 
     moves to replace the Ohio class ballistic submarine fleet 
     with the new Columbia class ballistic missile fleet.
       (9) While intercontinental ballistic missiles had 
     historically been the most responsive leg of the United 
     States nuclear triad, advances in ballistic missile submarine 
     communications now provide immediate dissemination of 
     information during wartime.
       (10) Intercontinental ballistic missiles cannot be 
     recalled, leaving decision-makers with mere minutes to decide 
     whether to launch the missiles before they are destroyed, 
     known as a posture of ``launch on warning&#x27;&#x27; or ``launch under 
     attack&#x27;&#x27; in the face of a perceived nuclear attack, greatly 
     increasing the risk of a national leader initiating a nuclear 
     war by mistake.

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4948">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4948">H4948</a></a>]]

       (11) In 1983, Stanislav Petrov, a former lieutenant colonel 
     of the Soviet Air Defense Forces correctly identified a false 
     warning in an early warning system that showed several United 
     States incoming nuclear missiles, preventing Soviet leaders 
     from launching a retaliatory response, earning Colonel Petrov 
     the nickname ``the man who saved the world&#x27;&#x27;.
       (12) Former Secretary of Defense William Perry, who once 
     briefed President Bill Clinton on a suspected Russian first 
     nuclear strike, wrote that the ground-based leg of the 
     nuclear triad is ``destabilizing because it invites an 
     attack&#x27;&#x27; and intercontinental ballistic missiles are ``some 
     of the most dangerous weapons in the world&#x27;&#x27; and ``could even 
     trigger an accidental nuclear war&#x27;&#x27;.
       (13) General James Cartwright, former vice chair of the 
     Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Commander of the United 
     States Strategic Command, wrote, with Secretary Perry, 
     ``[T]he greatest danger is not a Russian bolt but a US 
     blunder--that we might accidentally stumble into nuclear war. 
     As we make decisions about which weapons to buy, we should 
     use this simple rule: If a nuclear weapon increases the risk 
     of accidental war and is not needed to deter an intentional 
     attack, we should not build it. . . . Certain nuclear 
     weapons, such as...the [intercontinental ballistic missile], 
     carry higher risks of accidental war that, fortunately, we no 
     longer need to bear. We are safer without these expensive 
     weapons, and it would be foolish to replace them.&#x27;&#x27;.
       (14) General George Lee Butler, the former Commander-in-
     Chief of the Strategic Air Command and subsequently 
     Commander-in-Chief of the United States Strategic Command, 
     said, ``I would have removed land-based missiles from our 
     arsenal a long time ago. I&#x27;d be happy to put that mission on 
     the submarines. So, with a significant fraction of bombers 
     having a nuclear weapons capability that can be restored to 
     alert very quickly, and with even a small component of 
     Trident submarines--with all those missiles and all those 
     warheads on patrol--it&#x27;s hard to imagine we couldn&#x27;t get 
     by.&#x27;&#x27;.
       (15) While a sudden ``bolt from the blue&#x27;&#x27; first strike 
     from a near-peer nuclear adversary is a highly unlikely 
     scenario, extending the Minuteman III would maintain the 
     purported role of the intercontinental ballistic missile leg 
     of the triad to absorb such an attack.

     SEC. 1662. STATEMENT OF POLICY ON SERVICE LIFE OF MINUTEMAN 
                   III INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILES AND 
                   PAUSE IN DEVELOPMENT OF GROUND-BASED STRATEGIC 
                   DETERRENT PROGRAM.

       It is the policy of the United States that--
       (1) the operational life of the Minuteman III 
     intercontinental ballistic missiles shall be safely extended 
     until at least 2040; and
       (2) the research, development, testing, and evaluation of 
     the ground-based strategic deterrent program shall be paused 
     until 2031.

     SEC. 1663. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR GROUND BASED 
                   STRATEGIC DETERRENT PROGRAM AND W87-1 WARHEAD 
                   MODIFICATION PROGRAM.

       None of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act 
     or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2022 for the 
     Department or Defense or the National Nuclear Security 
     Administration may be obligated or expended for the ground-
     based strategic deterrent program (including with respect to 
     supporting infrastructure) or the W87-1 warhead modification 
     program.

     SEC. 1664. LIFE EXTENSION OF MINUTEMAN III INTERCONTINENTAL 
                   BALLISTIC MISSILES.

       (a) Life Extension Program.--Beginning not later than 180 
     days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
     Secretary of Defense shall commence efforts for a life 
     extension program of Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic 
     missiles to extend the life of such missiles to 2040.
       (b) Elements of Program.--In carrying out the life 
     extension program under subsection (a), the Secretary shall 
     ensure the following:
       (1) The program will incorporate new and necessary 
     technologies that could also be incorporated in the future 
     ground-based strategic deterrent program, including with 
     respect to technologies that--
       (A) increase the resilience against adversary missile 
     defenses; and
       (B) incorporate new nuclear command, control, and 
     communications systems.
       (2) The program will use nondestructive testing methods and 
     technologies similar to the testing methods used by the Navy 
     for Trident II <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/daily-digest/page/D5">D5</a> submarine launched ballistic missiles to 
     reduce destructive testing.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, the United States, Russia, and China are 
aggressively engaged in a new nuclear arms race. The rapid development 
by all three nations of new bombs, new stealth delivery systems, and 
near total reliance on space for observation and communications makes 
this new nuclear arms race far more dangerous than the previous arms 
race.
  Therefore, in an effort to slow the pace and to create time for arms 
control negotiations to move forward, I rise to offer an amendment to 
the fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act that pauses the 
development and prohibits the funding for the Ground Based Strategic 
Deterrent, the GBSD, program and the associated W87-1 nuclear warhead 
for the fiscal year 2022.
  This amendment also extends the service life of the Minuteman III 
Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, which is in place today, the 
current missile system that the GBSD is slated to replace, until at 
least 2040.
  My amendment also requires the use of nondestructive testing methods 
and technologies similar to those used by the Navy for the Trident II 
<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/daily-digest/page/D5">D5</a> submarine-launched ballistic missiles.
  There has been much debate over the ground-based leg of the nuclear 
triad recently. I have frequently argued for a longer pause for the 
GBSD program to help defer the cost of over $240 billion that will 
occur in the next 20 years for not only this, but the remaining nuclear 
enterprise monitorization initiatives and to slow the pace of the 
ongoing arms race with Russia and China.
  However, this amendment does not seek to permanently resolve the 
question of the future of the land-based ballistic missile systems. 
While that debate is of utmost importance, my amendment only seeks a 1-
year pause in the funding.
  Why a 1-year pause? The answer is because a short pause is practical 
and prudent, given the Biden administration is currently undertaking a 
new nuclear posture review, which is expected to be completed in the 
early calendar year of 2022.

                              {time}  1630

  The NPR will establish the future role of the nuclear arsenal. 
Further development of the GBSD, therefore, can occur after that time 
period.
  Now, before we spend billions of dollars in fiscal year 2022 on the 
GBSD and the W87-1 warhead, and over $276 billion when accounting for 
the total lifecycle cost on a nuclear missile system that is not yet 
needed, we should wait until the President completes the NPR so that we 
have a complete picture of the overall requirements.
  This pause will have absolutely no impact on our deterrence 
capability, now or in the near future. We know that the Minuteman III 
ICBMs can be safely life-extended until at least 2040. We know that 
because that is exactly what the Air Force intends to do with more than 
half of that arsenal. The U.S., Russia, and China, as they rush to 
modernize their nuclear arsenals, the tripwire is becoming more taut 
each and every day.
  Observation and communication satellites and systems are increasingly 
vulnerable to attacks. All three countries are fielding stealth and 
hypersonic nuclear delivery systems designed to evade detection. The 
risks of a false alarm or a political miscalculation has always--
always--haunted the nuclear landscape, and they do even more today.
  While we must recognize the need to preserve a safe, secure, and 
effective deterrent as long as nuclear weapon systems exist, some 
aspects of the current modernization programs are simply not required.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Ohio is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr. Garamendi, for 
bringing this forward. I do mean that ``thank you&#x27;&#x27; sincerely because 
he gives us an opportunity to highlight that this provision that he 
seeks to undo has strong bipartisan support.
  Representative Garamendi, although being my good friend, is in the 
minority of the minority. He gives us an opportunity to highlight that, 
in fact, his amendment would remove funding that is requested by 
President Joe Biden. It is of a program that was initiated by the Obama 
administration. These plans have been validated by three Presidential 
administrations--Democrat and Republican--six Congresses, and six 
Secretaries of Defense, and a bipartisan majority in Congress has voted 
repeatedly in support of this program. The same holds true for the 
warhead, which will eventually go on top of the missile. Both Democrat 
and Republican

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4949">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4949">H4949</a></a>]]

Presidents support this system as it will replace the oldest warhead in 
the U.S. arsenal. This will increase our safety and security.
  We have been told by Secretary Austin that to try to extend--if it 
could--the Minuteman III, it would take $38 billion more. We would have 
less capability. And earlier this year, we even had a failure of a 
Minuteman III ICBM test. This cannot be accomplished, and it has 
bipartisan support to move forward. This is about safety and security 
of our nuclear deterrent and our Nation.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Oh, my good friend from Ohio, how often have I heard 
you say that President Biden has been wrong so many times over the last 
6 months. And, indeed, he is wrong in this respect, also. So let&#x27;s 
agree on that.
  The fact of the matter is the extension of the Minuteman III for the 
next 15 to 20 years is not more expensive than the GBSD. In fact, the 
GBSD cost estimates compared to the Minuteman III are based on a 50-
year period of time until 2075.
  Oh my goodness. When did we last take up that period of time in any 
of our cost calculations here? We don&#x27;t. It is simply a false way of 
addressing the cost differential.
  It is, in fact, cheaper in the next 15 to 20 years to do a life cycle 
extension when necessary on the Minuteman III missiles, and it is 
entirely feasible to do so, as said by the military themselves.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California&#x27;s time has 
expired.
  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).
  Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong opposition to this 
amendment and the extreme damage it would do to our national security.
  This amendment is misguided based on the rapid changes in the global 
threat environment. It is well-established that Russia has modernized 
its entire nuclear arsenal. Meanwhile, we are still debating it, and we 
have a 50-year-old ICBM. Even more concerning is that we have recently 
learned that China has embarked on a crash nuclear buildup program, the 
pace of which has stunned observers around the world.
  Open-source reporting has recently confirmed three new Chinese ICBM 
fields with over 100 silos each. When armed, these silos, along with 
China&#x27;s road-mobile ICBMs model, will match our ICBM inventory, and 
they will be new. China is now on pace to quadruple its nuclear 
stockpile as it sprints to achieve parity with the United States and 
Russia.
  For the first time in our history, the United States confronts not 
one but two peer nuclear-armed competitors who do not share our values.
  Make no mistake, our friends and allies are watching this vote. 
Further delaying modernizing our land-based leg of the triad while 
China and Russia modernize theirs will have the disastrous effect of 
encouraging allies to develop their own nuclear capabilities or, worse, 
submit to coercion from China and Russia.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Ohio has the only time 
remaining.
  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining.
  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. Moore).
  Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, 
and I thank my friend from California for the debate as well.
  Mr. Speaker, we debate this often. We have made our points. We have 
done this in committee for several months. I want to highlight a couple 
of things here of what I believe is misinformation about this program, 
specifically related to the cost and effectiveness of the current 
Minuteman III.
  The amendment sponsors will claim that the Congressional Budget 
Office has concluded that Minuteman III life extension will cost $37 
billion less than GBSD. The Office of the Secretary of Defense and the 
U.S. Air Force have come to a different conclusion.
  I recall conversations in a committee hearing with Secretary Roth, an 
appointment of President Biden, talking about when you look at the 
overall benefit of GBSD, if we continue to try to fix our old 
carburetor or my old furnace, it is not going to be more effective for 
what the long-term gain is.
  The Democrat sponsors will claim that the Air Force has stated that 
they can extend the Minuteman III. Admiral Richard told us that a life 
extension is not possible. We simply don&#x27;t have the parts. We have the 
engineers at Hill Air Force Base that are looking on eBay, trying to 
get actual parts for this.
  Mr. Speaker, this is not possible. It is time to modernize.
  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. Jackson).
  Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for 
yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment, as it cuts 
funding for the W87-1 warhead, which will be assembled at the Pantex 
Plant in Amarillo, Texas.
  These are funds that have been mentioned or requested by President 
Biden and are broadly supported across all of Congress. Cutting funding 
for the W87-1 would be irresponsible and unsafe, as it is slated to 
replace the W78, which will soon be the oldest weapon in the stockpile.
  This program was started by Obama, continued by Trump, and is now 
being funded by Biden. It has been a great success as it has hit all of 
its markers and is on track to reach IOC and deliver the first unit in 
2030.
  Further, plutonium pits for the W87-1 will eventually be produced at 
the Los Alamos National Lab and Savannah River Site, giving us a 
production capability that we do not currently have.
  For these reasons and the others mentioned by my colleagues, I urge 
everyone to oppose this far-left attempt to unilaterally disarm the 
United States.
  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, Representative Garamendi is correct. Russia 
and China are in an arms race; we are not merely modernizing our 
forces. It is sad that we are here trying to defend against an 
amendment that will weaken our national defense just as yesterday the 
majority cut a billion dollars from the defense of Israel in its Iron 
Dome, which will only make it more likely that there is conflict.
  Cutting our nuclear deterrent also just increases the likelihood that 
there would be conflict. This is about making certain our country 
remains safe. This is about our national security. Everyone should vote 
``no&#x27;&#x27; on this amendment.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to amendment No. 38, 
offered by my colleague Rep. Garamendi. The sponsors of this amendment 
would have you believe that this amendment is an attempt to save money 
and that life extending the Minuteman III ICBM is a cost saver. This is 
simply untrue. The House Armed Services Committee has heard witness 
after witness testify that any Minuteman Ill life extension will cost 
billions more than GBSD. We&#x27;ve heard from Admiral Richard of STRATCOM, 
General Hyten, and General Milley that the current ICBM can no longer 
be credibly or affordably sustained--and even if it could, it would not 
meet deterrence requirements of the future. According to Secretary 
Austin, even if the Minuteman III could be life extended, which is 
increasingly difficult as antiquated parts fall out of production, such 
an effort would be at least $38 billion more expensive than GBSD. For 
the MM III to be usefully life extended, the United States would need 
to replace a number of major missile components--which, even if 
accomplished at cost and on time, would still fall short of the 
Department of Defense&#x27;s requirements--including accommodating modern 
safety and security features and defeating the emerging anti-missile 
technologies of our adversaries. GBSD will incorporate low risk, 
technically mature components; feature a modular architecture that can 
incorporate emerging technology to adapt to rapidly evolving threat 
environments; and will be easier to maintain than the MM III--all of 
which will save on costs and provide great value as GBSD operates well 
into the 2070s. Finally, the GBSD program will not only replace the MM 
III missile, but also modernize the launch facilities, improve command 
and control, and increase safety and security. While our adversaries 
are modernizing

their deterrents at breakneck speed, the proposed amendment would keep

gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Schrader) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.
  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer an amendment to this 
year&#x27;s National Defense Authorization Act to help rein in a practice 
that has existed from the 1990s known as the unfunded priorities list 
or unfunded requirements list.
  The practice originally had good intent, to allow some flexibility 
for the Armed Services for issues that came up outside of the normal 
appropriations process, but it has grown to become embedded to 
encompass larger areas in the Pentagon budget that were never 
considered to be part of that mandate at the time.
  Mr. Speaker, we are getting out of Afghanistan. We have decided that 
we are not going to be pursuing every war overseas, trying to protect 
American servicemen and -women. Our budget should reflect that.
  We have tried to be honest in our budget this year. The overseas 
contingency budget has been eliminated. Let&#x27;s be honest in our budget 
request.
  We go through an extensive process, both in the authorizing committee 
of the Armed Services and in our Committee on Appropriations, to make 
sure that the budget requests are reasonable and reflect the interests 
of the American people and the congressional districts that we 
represent.
  Let&#x27;s be honest here. The budget has changed. It is time to rein in 
some of the spending. The Defense Department has showcased $125 billion 
in waste and inefficiencies within its own budget. It is time to rein 
that in. The unfunded requirement list, the unfunded priorities list, 
is part of that.
  My amendment does not eliminate it. I want to repeat that. It does 
not eliminate it. It just restricts its use back to the services and 
SOCOM, like it was originally intended. It still gives the Pentagon the 
ability to showcase additional needs not included in the main budget 
request, but it eliminates that budgetary creep that we have seen over 
the past several years.
  Mr. Speaker, this issue crosses party lines. Former Senate Armed 
Services Committee Chairman John McCain said, ``I am not really big on 
unfunded priority lists. I think they are sort of a backdoor way of 
getting things done.&#x27;&#x27;
  We have actually seen what happens when the Pentagon stops this from 
happening. With Roberts Gates as Secretary, we cut down on the use of 
these UPLs drastically during his tenure, and the DOD budget continued 
to operate just fine.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to 
this amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I want people to understand what 
the gentleman is proposing because it is naive and reckless.
  When we get the budget proposal from the administration, it is just 
that. It is a proposal. But it is also from the executive branch. It is 
not coming directly from the combatant commanders, who are the 
individuals that we charge with the responsibility for executing the 
U.S. missions around the world.
  This amendment would prohibit them giving us the items that were not 
funded by the President&#x27;s budget proposal. Keep in mind, both this 
President and the last President have given us budget proposals that 
were grossly inadequate. We were able to remedy it under the last 
President; we were able to remedy it in this one with this President. 
And we depend heavily on what the combatant commanders tell us they 
need.
  It is critical that Congress knows what the commanders need to keep 
our servicemembers safe and ensure the success of their missions.
  Here is an example. In the fiscal year 2022 unfunded priority, the 
CENTCOM commander sent us a $106 million request to operate and 
maintain the Patriot batteries deployed in Iraq to keep our troops safe 
from missiles fired from Iran and the proxies in Syria.
  That money was not in the Biden budget. We found out about it and 
funded it because of that critical need, and it is now in the bill 
because General McKenzie told us about it in his unfunded requirement 
list. We wouldn&#x27;t have known about that otherwise. That is just one 
example of why this amendment is misguided.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose it, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.

                              {time}  1645

  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I think the good gentleman on the other 
side of the aisle is confused. We are not talking about restricting the 
appropriations process or the Armed Services Committee from making the 
decisions and the priorities based on what is submitted by the Defense 
Department agencies, as well as congressional districts themselves.
  This merely just says, if we abide by some of the decisions, we 
should abide by the decisions that are made by the Appropriations 
Committee, as the good gentleman points out. Actually, abide by the 
decisions that are made by the appropriators, based on their input, the 
intel that was just described.
  We are talking about the unfunded priorities list, which is basically 
a slush fund for mission creep that we no longer need. We have to 
respect the will of the people, the congressional districts that we 
represent, and should abide by their wishes in our budgetary 
allocations.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I know the gentleman means well, 
but I am not misguided, and I don&#x27;t misunderstand anything.
  I know exactly what the unfunded requirements request list is, it is 
a vital piece of information for our committee to do its oversight, and 
I urge the Members of this body to reject this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I would just point out, as Chairman

Smith said in last year&#x27;s NDAA, some people believe that no matter what 
you spend on the Pentagon and defense spending, you should always spend 
more. And they are trying to push us down that road towards more, which 
is wrong, because it is waste.
  It is also wrong because it is bad for national security. We need to 
make choices, not imagine that the budget is unlimited. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, this is a terrible and reckless 
amendment, and I urge all the Members of this body to reject it, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, very simply put, my colleagues and 
friends, if the priorities did not make it into the largest piece of 
the discretionary budget that we vote on, how big a priority can it 
really be? Let&#x27;s restrict, but not eliminate, the unfunded priorities 
list.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

             Amendment No. 40 Offered by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
40 printed in part C of <a href="/congressional-report/117th-congress/house-report/125">House Report 117-125</a>.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to offer amendment 40, 
as the designee of Congressman Mark Pocan, to reduce the Pentagon 
budget by 10 percent.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of subtitle A of title X, insert the following:

     SEC. 10__. REDUCTION IN AMOUNT AUTHORIZED TO BE APPROPRIATED 
                   FOR FISCAL YEAR 2022 BY THIS ACT.

       (a) In General.--The amount authorized to be appropriated 
     for fiscal year 2022 by this Act is the aggregate amount 
     authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 2022 by this 
     Act minus the amount equal to 10 percent of the aggregate 
     amount.
       (b) Allocation.--The reduction made by subsection (a) shall 
     apply on a pro rata basis among the accounts and funds for 
     which amounts are authorized to be appropriated by this Act 
     (other than the Defense Health Program, military personnel, 
     and persons appointed into the civil service as defined in 
     section 2101 of title 5, United States Code), and shall be 
     applied on a pro rata basis across each program, project, and 
     activity funded by the account or fund concerned.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer amendment 40, 
to reduce the Pentagon budget by 10 percent.
  During a time when our country is withdrawing from foreign wars, when 
COVID-19 and its fallout is one of the greatest threats that we face, 
when record levels of unemployment, housing, and healthcare crises are 
among us, the United States should be reducing its military spending by 
at least 10 percent and prioritize the very needs of our communities 
here at home.
  Today, we can cut the defense authorization by 10 percent, without 
any need to deny our servicemembers or their families any of the 
support that they need. And in doing so, we can free up to $77 billion 
to go towards fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and much more.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this amendment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized for 
5 minutes.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, this amendment will strip $79 
billion out of the bill. That would have catastrophic effects on our 
training and readiness.
  I need to remind Members, we have been at war for two decades, we 
have worn out everything we have got. We have got to start replacing 
and modernizing for the future to be able to take on the threats from 
China and other adversaries. This will set us back on clean-up and 
environmental remediation of PFAS and other contaminated items.
  It would put off construction of new military housing, schools, and 
childcare facilities, and the list goes on.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose this amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, there was a point brought up that 
this could potentially threaten our readiness, and I would counter that 
it is not the readiness that cutting our defense budget threatens, it 
is the profit margins of defense contractors.
  In fact, almost every major defense contractor here in the United 
States has had to pay fines or settlements for fraud or misconduct, all 
while getting about $1 trillion in public funding in defense contracts. 
I have seen this personally in my work on the Oversight and Reform 
Committee, where we have encountered contractor after contractor 
gouging the public and draining our resources.
  In fact, the $77 billion is not even that hard to find. The Pentagon 
could save almost $58 billion by eliminating obsolete weapons, weapons 
like Cold War era bombers and missiles designed and built in the last 
century that are completely unsuitable for this one.
  We could find another $18 billion by simply preventing the end-of-
year spending sprees that lead to contract money being shoveled out the 
door every September. In fact, the Congressional Research Service has 
documented these spending spikes, and you could set your watch to it.
  Each September, as offices at the Pentagon go on last minute spending 
sprees to justify next year&#x27;s budget increases, we have increased our 
military spending year after year, senselessly and needlessly. And now, 
again, during a time when we have ended an almost two decade war, there 
is no reason for us to be increasing our military spending and our 
defense budget when we are not funding childcare, healthcare, housing 
priorities, and the climate crisis here at home.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, this bill does everything the 
gentlewoman just talked about. We are investing in those items that she 
has talked about, and we are divesting ourselves of those $78 billion 
worth of legacy platforms that will not be useful in the future, and we 
are applying that money toward future platforms.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. 
DesJarlais), my friend and colleague, and an outstanding member of the 
Armed Services Committee.
  Mr. DesJARLAIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the 
Pocan amendment. A 10 percent cut to this budget will leave America 
vulnerable to our adversaries.
  The United States is facing daily threats from China, Iran, Russia, 
North Korea, and a whole host of other bad actors. We must fully fund 
our military so the U.S. has every capability necessary to deter those 
who wish to do us harm.
  The fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act has 
bipartisan support from the House Armed Services Committee already. 
With the approved budget on the floor today being $23.9 billion more 
than the bare-bones budget that originally came through. There is a 
reason why the improved budget was approved in a bipartisan vote of the 
committee by an overwhelming 57-2 margin.
  Modernization is an important part of our military strategy. Our 
military leaders have spent the past year sounding the alarm and 
testimony before Congress that our top competitors, Russia and China, 
are working at a startling pace to close the gap between themselves and 
the U.S. in areas like

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4952">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4952">H4952</a></a>]]

nuclear modernization. In other areas, like hypersonic capabilities, 
they may have already surpassed us.
  This budget is absolutely necessary in order to maintain advantages 
over our enemies as technology continues to evolve and change rapidly. 
Now is not the time to recklessly cut what we must spend to protect our 
country and provide for our men and women in uniform.
  We must ensure our brave men and women in the armed services have 
every resource necessary to keep the American people safe.
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, the Pentagon is the only Federal 
department that has never passed an audit, despite this requirement 
being on the books for over 30 years. You know there are folks who are 
supportive of the current levels, the increase and skyrocketing levels 
of defense spending, saying, we are already meeting all of our needs 
with this.

  I don&#x27;t think a single American, I don&#x27;t know a single member of my 
district that can say that our childcare needs are being met in this 
country, that our healthcare needs are being met, that our climate 
action that is necessary is being met. Our needs are not being met.
  And despite all of this rhetoric about the deficit and all this fear 
about government spending, for some reason, our defense budget seems to 
be exempt from this conversation, and that we ask Americans and people 
in this country year after year to engage in the magical thinking that 
defense spending comes at no real cost. It does.
  It comes at the cost of our security, because when we do not have and 
we are not able to go to school, to go to work and count on childcare 
for our children, it makes us less safe. When we are not able go to an 
emergency room and have our healthcare covered, we are less safe.
  The degradation and erosion of our social systems here domestically 
is a threat as well. And that is happening because of our explosion in 
defense spending. The explosion in defense spending is coming at the 
cost of our domestic development here at home.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I would point out that achieving 
or meeting the objectives that the gentlewoman just outlined and 
defense are not mutually exclusive, we can do both and should do both.
  And I would point out that the $3.5 trillion that the other side is 
proposing doesn&#x27;t spend a dime on defense. Also, we are in the process 
of auditing. The gentlewoman is exactly right, the Defense Department 
has never passed an audit. This bill continues the pressure on them to 
get that complete. We have had many agencies that passed, not all have, 
and we are not going to let up until they pass an audit.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin 
(Mr. Gallagher), the ranking member of the Military Personnel 
Subcommittee and the Armed Services Committee, and an outstanding 
leader.
  Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment, 
which I think would be very destructive.
  Earlier this year, the former head of Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral 
Phil Davidson, warned that the Chinese Communist Party could make a 
move on Taiwan within the next 6 years. Within the next 6 years, we 
could be facing a crisis unlike anything we have seen in our lifetime.
  This assessment was concurred by the chief of naval operations, the 
commandant of the Marine Corps. And the idea that we are going to do an 
across the board 10 percent cut, an indiscriminate across the board 10 
percent cut to the Pentagon, at a time when we are facing a serious 
national crisis, I think, makes absolutely no sense.
  The ranking member pointed out the irony and tragedy that the other 
side is proposing to spend $3.5 trillion on social welfare spending, 
and then telling us that we have an explosion in defense spending, when 
defense spending, as a percentage of GDP, is still at lows relative to 
what we spent during the Cold War.
  Does anyone seriously believe that by releasing a press release or 
engaging in a security partnership with the Taliban we somehow ended a 
war? Does anyone seriously believe that the struggle against Salafi 
jihadism is somehow over because we have surrendered in that struggle? 
Absolutely not.
  And the reason and the irony that defense spending has gone up, if 
you can even compare the Obama cut in real terms to the Reagan defense 
build-up, it is not because of missiles or ships or bombs, it is 
because of increasing personnel costs, right? It is healthcare and 
retirement costs.
  So as an empirical matter, what you are arguing is simply not true. 
As for spending too much money on defense, what costs a lot of money is 
when you stumble into war on someone else&#x27;s terms, and the best way to 
do that is to project weakness. Weakness invites aggression. We can 
achieve peace only through strength.

                              {time}  1700

  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I think what we just experienced and 
have seen in our last two-decade war is exemplary of the types of waste 
that goes on, where what we see is lack of oversight and what we see is 
runaway military contractor spending with little oversight in what is 
going on, and then folks are caught surprised in the end that all of 
this investment seems to not have panned out and it has not been 
invested in the way that the American public was led to believe all 
along.
  Now, not only are they tremendous costs that we had laid out earlier, 
but also this explosion in spending leaves our public health priorities 
underfunded, militarizes every problem in our society, and turns 
peaceful protesters into targets for weapons of war.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this amendment, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, this amendment guts our bill 
which is, I am certain, the gentlewoman&#x27;s intention. It is recklessly 
irresponsible. It would harm our servicemembers and their families.
  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all Members to oppose it, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.

  Specifically, it would remove the Rogers amendment which would 
increase the pending authorization by $23.9 billion. When Mr. Rogers&#x27; 
amendment was offered during committee markup, I voted against it, and 
nothing over the last few weeks has led me to change my mind.
  Mr. Speaker, just 3 weeks ago we ended our military operations in 
Afghanistan--America&#x27;s longest war and one that started when I was in 
middle school. Yet what some are concluding from that is that what we 
need is more war, more weapons, and billions of dollars more than even 
what the Pentagon themselves are asking for.
  So many of my colleagues who supported Mr. Rogers&#x27; amendment note the 
emerging threat from China as their reason to support this increase, 
even though very little of this increase is even relevant to China and 
most national security experts agree that making needed domestic 
investments is far more important to our competitiveness with China. 
Instead, this inflated budget seeks to sugarcoat that for years we have 
been decreasing investments in diplomacy and the support of our 
servicemembers in favor of purchasing new, unproven, and un-needed 
weapons.
  We need to have an honest conversation about the Pentagon budget and 
focus on what is achievable, what the real threats are, and what we 
actually need for our national security. For the last 20 years, we have 
been told that we need more, but I think it is time to recognize that 
there are simply not military solutions to every problem.
  I thank Congresswoman Lee for offering this amendment.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes&#x27;&#x27;, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to 
the amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized for 
5 minutes.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.
  Mr. Speaker, here we go again. This time they are stripping $25 
billion in funding added by Republicans and Democrats on the committee.
  The gentlewoman argues that the Biden budget is sufficient for our 
national defense. I strongly disagree. The Biden budget constitutes a 
cut of about $4 billion in real spending from last year. The budget 
cuts the number of Navy ships. It cuts the number of Navy ships and 
destabilizes the industrial base. It slashes procurement across the 
board. It guts missile defense. It leaves unfunded $25 billion in 
combatant commander priorities, and it cuts the Army, Navy, Air Force, 
and Marines. At least they left the Space Corps alone.
  It does all this while our adversaries, especially China, are 
investing in military modernization. China increased its defense 
spending by 75 percent over the last decade--6 percent this year alone. 
They are leapfrogging this into capabilities like AI and hypersonics, 
and they are stepping up malign operations against America and our 
allies.
  What is the President&#x27;s response to this?
  He responds with a budget that would cut funding programs that we 
need to deter China. It doesn&#x27;t make sense, especially when he is 
proposing to swell nondefense spending by a massive 16 percent this 
year. This bill corrects that.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose this amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. JACOBS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith), who is the esteemed chair of the 
Armed Services Committee.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to get the 
numbers clear here. The budget proposed by President Biden was $753 
billion, and by supporting this amendment, we support President Biden&#x27;s 
budget of $753 billion, which was a $12 billion increase over last 
year&#x27;s budget.
  Last year&#x27;s budget--the last budget from the Trump administration--
only increased the defense budget that year by $3 billion. So a $3 
billion increase last year was perfectly acceptable to my Republican 
colleagues in the House and Senate under President Trump. A $12 billion 
increase this year is not. So the numbers are just being dramatically 
presented here as some kind of cut when it is actually a bigger 
increase than Trump did in his last year in the White House.
  Let me make it clear: I see the threats, and I do agree more with my 
Republican colleagues on that point. I don&#x27;t support the previous 
amendment that does the $75 billion cut because I understand the threat 
environment and I know that we need to modernize to meet that threat 
environment.
  But the other thing I see is decades of waste and wasteful 
expenditures on programs like the F-35 and the Ford-class carrier.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Ms. JACOBS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an 
additional 30 seconds.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, we spent money in a very 
imprudent way. We have got to instill discipline at the Pentagon so we 
get value for the dollars that we spend. Simply giving them another $25 
billion does not do that, and $753 billion is enough. It is even better 
if we actually start spending it wisely, intelligently, and 
effectively. That doesn&#x27;t happen. I am a little short. Can you just 
give me a little more money?

  I always love the Winston Churchill quote: ``Gentlemen, we have run 
out of money; now we have to think.&#x27;&#x27;
  That is the type of discipline we need at the Pentagon, not just to 
give them a blank check every time they ask. The President&#x27;s budget is 
sufficient to meet our needs.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the amendment.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman), who is a real leader on the 
Armed Services Committee and ranking member on the Seapower and 
Projection Forces Subcommittee.
  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Republican leader for yielding.
  Similar to the previous amendment, I believe this amendment is 
extremely misguided. In fact, on March 24 of this year, I invited both 
Ms. Lee and Mr. Pocan to attend a classified briefing on the 
existential threats we face in great power competition.
  Mr. Speaker, instead of taking me up on that offer, they continue to 
turn a blind eye. The chairs of the Defense Spending Reduction Caucus 
don&#x27;t want to learn about what the threats are. They don&#x27;t want to 
learn more about the critical capabilities that would be out of the 
hands of our warfighters if this amendment were to pass.
  I can stand here and tell that caucus about how this plus-up has $9.8 
billion in procurement that is aimed directly at deterring China. That 
means building additional ships, among other capabilities, to keep up 
with China.
  Or I can tell them that there is $3 billion for sustainment 
operations that allow our warfighters to conduct global operations, 
including humanitarian operations in places like Haiti.
  Or I can tell them there is $3.8 billion for military construction to 
improve facilities in districts across the country to make sure our 
servicemembers aren&#x27;t working in rundown facilities.
  I can even tell them there is $5.2 billion for research and 
development that assures our future servicemembers will have what they 
need when called upon to do the job or to fight to victory and come 
home safe.
  But I don&#x27;t think any of that is going to resonate because these 
progressive Members don&#x27;t want to learn about the existential threats 
we face. These far-left Members just want to play progressive politics, 
and that means weakening our national security.
  To the rest of my colleagues here today, this plus-up is good for 
national security and good for this country.
  Mr. Speaker, you can ask any service branch chief or combatant 
commander--because we have asked them--and they have told us these are 
the things that they need going forward.

  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge everyone to vote against this amendment.
  Ms. JACOBS of California. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I 
have remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California has 1\3/4\ 
minutes remaining. The gentleman from Alabama has 2 minutes remaining.
  Ms. JACOBS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez).
  Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of amendment No. 41 
which would cut $25.5 billion from the defense authorization bill.
  There were some accusations just now saying that this is about 
progressive politics. But this bill allocates $25 billion more than 
President Biden even requested. So what we should be doing is sticking 
to the plan and giving the President of the United States what he 
determines is necessary for defense spending and not a dime more.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from the great State of Alabama (Mr. Carl), who is one of our 
outstanding freshmen on the Armed Services Committee.
  Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose this amendment.
  There are several different ways to look at this amendment. The 
budget that we got from the President was before our problems in 
Afghanistan. We asked him for $25 billion to replace $80 to $85 billion 
we left on the ground for the Taliban to fight back at us. So I ask 
that we keep an open mind on replacing that equipment, if nothing else.
  It is critical to pass this bill which includes a bipartisan 
increase--I repeat, bipartisan.
  How many times do you hear that word, Mr. Speaker?
  I have been here for 9 months, and I can probably count that on one 
hand.
  The bill includes a bipartisan increase in spending to counter 
threats and project U.S. strength around the world.
  This amendment would limit readiness and the needed capabilities to 
counter these threats. Passage of this amendment would basically 
shortchange our military at a time when they need our support more than 
ever.
  I am proud to have worked on this bill with my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to ensure that our military is fully funded so our 
men and women in uniform have the resources they need to protect and 
defend the United States of America.
  Folks in my district in south Alabama work hard every day to support 
the military readiness of this country. Unlike President Biden and his 
allies in Congress, Alabamians understand how important it is to fully 
fund our military.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support our Armed Forces and 
oppose this amendment.
  Ms. JACOBS of California. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama has the right to 
close. The gentlewoman is recognized.
  Ms. JACOBS of California. Mr. Speaker, I hear my colleagues on the 
other side talk a lot about the needs from Afghanistan. What is 
interesting is that in the continuing resolution that this body passed 
just yesterday there was additional supplemental funding for 
Afghanistan, and yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
decided to vote against it.

  I also hear them talk about the threats and the briefings that 
supposedly we were not in. I sit on both the Foreign Affairs and Armed 
Services Committees, I assure you, Mr. Speaker, I have been to every 
single one of those classified briefings on the threats. I am very 
aware of the threats. But we need to dispel the notion that our ability 
to respond to the threats depends solely on the size of our military.
  I am honored to represent San Diego, a proud military community. They 
don&#x27;t need a larger budget. They need one that takes their needs into 
account, which means better wages and housing free of mold, childcare 
and job opportunities for their spouses, and they need a government 
that goes through every diplomatic channel before making the decision 
to send them to war.
  Earlier this month vice chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General 
John Hyten asked: Do you think any taxpayer in this country would 
believe that for $700 billion a year we can&#x27;t have a great defense?
  Hyten said: We should be able to, and it is crazy that we can&#x27;t.
  He is right. It is crazy, and more of us need to be willing to say 
what everyone knows is true: we don&#x27;t need to spend money even the 
Pentagon themselves are not asking for.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1715

  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill before this 
body, the FY22 National Defense Authorization Act, would increase 
spending by 3 percent over inflation, which is a modest increase. And 
it passed our committee with an overwhelming bipartisan vote.
  This amendment guts the bill. I urge all Members to oppose it, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the

       (2) The term ``National Security Innovation Base&#x27;&#x27; means 
     the network of persons and organizations, including Federal 
     agencies, institutions of higher education, Federally funded 
     research and development centers, defense industrial base 
     entities, nonprofit organizations, commercial entities, and 
     venture capital firms that are engaged in the military and 
     non-military research, development, funding, and production 
     of innovative technologies that support the national security 
     of the United States.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island.
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, the United States attracts and develops some of the 
brightest minds in the world. They can fortify national security and 
boost economic competitiveness. Unfortunately, much of that talent 
leaves because there are few options to remain.
  My amendment provides a pathway to citizenship for the best foreign 
talent to work in the U.S. in support of our National Security 
Innovation Base. Great power competition is a race for talent to 
maintain our military and technological superiority. We want the 
brightest minds in the world working for us, not the Chinese Communist 
Party.
  The U.S. has less than 5 percent of world&#x27;s population, so it is no 
surprise that many great scientific minds are born outside U.S. 
borders. So then how have we maintained our technological superiority 
over the last 70 years, by way of example?
  Well, our world-class universities and innovative private sector 
attract future Nobel laureates in critical technologies like machine 
learning and artificial intelligence. However, our constricted pathways 
to residency and citizenship drive this talent into the arms of our 
adversaries; so we face intense competition from other countries who 
offer large research grants and expedited citizenship to lure this 
talent away.
  But it is not just potential adversaries. Some U.S. companies are 
setting up R&D facilities in Canada because their immigration policies 
more effectively attract highly-skilled workers.
  Under this amendment, the Secretary of Defense will implement a 
competitive annual process to select scientists with technical 
expertise in critical technologies and recommend them for proper 
processing and vetting. It is in our national security interests not 
only to have these scientists working on research on our behalf, but 
also to prevent this talent from working for our adversaries.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Wisconsin is recognized 
for 5 minutes.
  Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  The ramifications of this amendment could be dangerous and far-
reaching. Quite frankly, we should not be looking outside of the United 
States for such scientists and researchers. We should cultivate our own 
talent. Unfortunately, this bill does nothing to develop that talent.
  We must ask, which foreign nationals would be eligible for the 
program? Most likely, those from China.
  China is so intent on using our U.S. immigration system to steal our 
sensitive technologies that the Trump administration had to issue a 
proclamation suspending entry of certain Chinese students and 
researchers.
  The Trump administration proclamation stated: ``The People&#x27;s Republic 
of China is engaged in a wide-ranging and heavily resourced campaign to 
acquire sensitive United States technologies . . . to bolster the 
modernization and capability of its military.&#x27;&#x27;
  The proclamation went on to state that ``students or researchers from 
the PRC studying beyond the undergraduate level . . . are at high risk 
of being exploited or co-opted by the PRC.&#x27;&#x27;
  Because of the brutal nature of the Chinese Communist Party, the same 
is true for virtually any Chinese national who comes to the United 
States to study or research, or to otherwise work in sensitive 
technologies like those contemplated under this amendment.
  In fact, the Department of Homeland Security told us last year that 
the Chinese government requires its nationals to ``support, assist, and 
cooperate with State intelligence work.&#x27;&#x27;
  The idea for this amendment came, at least in part, from the 
Commission on Artificial Intelligence, which called for ``increasing 
China brain drain.&#x27;&#x27; So clearly, the green cards contemplated under 
this amendment would go to Chinese nationals.
  The last thing we should do is make it easy for the Chinese Communist 
Party to gain access to our National Security Innovation Base work, 
Department of Defense research, or other critical technologies.
  I would also note that, sadly, the Department of Defense does not 
have a great track record regarding immigrant programs. Many of you may 
remember that the Department of Defense supported and encouraged the 
Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest program through 
which foreign nationals were able to enlist in the U.S. military. Once 
enlisted, they were eligible to naturalize.
  The Department of Defense was not living up to its promise to 
adequately vet and perform high-level background checks on the MAVNI 
participants. The program was halted by the Obama administration when 
it was discovered that the Department had allowed some Chinese spies to 
enlist in the military.
  Let that sink in. The Department of Defense let Chinese spies enlist 
in the U.S. military. So I am not comfortable with several aspects of 
the program created by this amendment. I urge my colleagues to oppose 
the amendment.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Rhode Island has 3 
minutes remaining. The gentleman from Wisconsin has 2 minutes 
remaining.

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4956">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4956">H4956</a></a>]]

  

  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren).
  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this amendment that would 
allow a small number of special immigrant visas to the world&#x27;s top 
scientists and technical experts selected by the Secretary of Defense. 
I trust the Secretary of Defense looking out after the Nation&#x27;s 
security interests, and it is important that our security depends on 
having access to the top scientists in the world who are committed to 
the success of our country.
  We need to take bold action to make sure that we educate and train 
our American people to be the best scientists they can be. But that 
doesn&#x27;t mean that every smart person who loves America was born in 
America. In fact, some of the most patriotic people I have ever met 
were immigrants who came here and became Americans by choice.
  It is absolutely clear that nations that attract and retain highly-
skilled innovators gain a competitive advantage, and we can help do 
that for America through this very thoughtful plan. For us, the promise 
of the American Dream remains a powerful draw for the world&#x27;s 
innovators.
  This amendment would move us in the right direction and help ensure 
that America, and not our competitors, benefits from the world&#x27;s best 
minds.
  I want to thank Mr. Langevin for this smart amendment, and I urge its 
adoption.
  Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, so once again, we hear that this will be a 
small number of people that are coming in. All we have to do is look at 
our southern border and other places for hearing about how small 
numbers of people are going to come into our country.
  We also hear, trust the Secretary of Defense. As I cited in my 
opening remarks, we had a real problem with the MAVNI program, where 
the Obama administration discovered Chinese spies in our military. This 
is a serious, serious situation.
  And here is the thing that I find frustrating, Mr. Speaker. We have 
so many people that project our freedoms and how we view them on other 
countries, including China, that they treat their people the same way. 
They simply do not, and it is fully proven that the Chinese Communist 
Party demands complete fealty of anyone, whether they are in China, or 
they come to our country to go back and give all information to the 
Chinese Communist Party. They do not protect intellectual property 
rights, which are a foundation of our freedoms here in America. We 
should not be sanguine about what this amendment will do.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers so I am 
prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, let me just say that when the Secretary of 
Defense deems it vital to the national security interests of the United 
States, this would give that authority to grant this special pathway to 
the Secretary to make that determination.
  A special immigrant visa, by the way, to streamline the admission of 
applicants in the name of national security is not new. My amendment is 
modeled after a 1949 law granting the Director of the CIA the authority 
to obtain permanent residency for anyone deemed ``in the interest of 
national security or essential to the furtherance of national 
intelligence missions.&#x27;&#x27;
  Today, the Secretary of Defense has no mechanism for retaining top 
technical and scientific talent who are vital to national security.
  Unsurprisingly, the Department of Defense explicitly endorses the 
amendment. So, again, my amendment is not new or groundbreaking to the 
immigration conversation. In fact, again, it provides the Secretary of 
Defense with the same authority that the Director of the CIA has 
enjoyed since 1949.
  This authority is not challenged as a less strident or reckless 
method that our adversaries exploit because it does not circumvent the 
current immigration process. All the Secretary of Defense innovation 
referrals are subject to the same rigorous and extensive background 
checks that any other applicant receives. I am confident that they will 
properly vet these applicants as we will keep the best talent in the 
world working on our behalf.
  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment to ensure our 
continued military and technological superiority.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
amendment.
  International students and researchers provide enormous benefits for 
American competitiveness and prosperity. As of 2018, immigrants founded 
50 of the 91 privately held billion-dollar startup tech companies in 
the United States. A quarter of those founders came to the U.S. as 
international students. These companies created an average of 1,200 
jobs each, and have a collective value of $250 billion. International 
students and researchers bring fresh perspectives, diverse experiences, 
expertise, energy, and creativity to the U.S. research enterprise.
  The global competition to attract top science, technology, 
engineering, mathematics, and medical talent is intensifying. And 
attracting talent is just half the battle. Restrictive immigration 
policies and xenophobic rhetoric, restrictions due to the pandemic, and 
concerted efforts by other countries to attract talent, have given 
talented international STEM students good reason to consider 
opportunities outside of the U.S. We must take bold action now to 
ensure the U.S. can continue to attract and retain global STEM talent.
  This amendment creates a new pathway to permanent residency for a 
small number of outstanding students and professionals engaged in 
critical fields that are vital to achieving the goals of the National 
Defense Strategy and National Defense Science and Technology Strategy. 
While modest in scope, the amendment would help advance areas of 
innovation that are critical to our national security and economic 
competitiveness.
  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

                Amendment No. 105 Offered by Mr. Bowman

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
105 printed in part C of <a href="/congressional-report/117th-congress/house-report/125">House Report 117-125</a>.
  Mr. BOWMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise as the designee of the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

          amendment no. 105 offered by mr. bowman of new york

       Add at the end of title LX the following:

     SEC. 6___. CONTRACTS BY THE PRESIDENT, THE VICE PRESIDENT, OR 
                   A CABINET MEMBER.

       (a) Amendment.--Section 431 of title 18, United States 
     Code, is amended--
       (1) in the section heading, by inserting ``the President, 
     the Vice President, a Cabinet Member, or a&#x27;&#x27; after 
     ``Contracts by&#x27;&#x27;; and
       (2) in the first undesignated paragraph, by inserting ``the 
     President, the Vice President, or any member of the 
     Cabinet,&#x27;&#x27; after ``Whoever, being&#x27;&#x27;.
       (b) Table of Sections Amendment.--The table of sections for 
     chapter 23 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by 
     striking the item relating to section 431 and inserting the 
     following:

``431. Contracts by the President, the Vice President, a Cabinet 
              Member, or a Member of Congress.&#x27;&#x27;.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. Bowman) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.
  Mr. BOWMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer a commonsense, good-
government amendment that has already passed this House on a bipartisan 
basis.
  Decades ago, Congress recognized that there is an inherent conflict 
of interest when elected officials, who decide how taxpayer dollars are 
spent,

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4957">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4957">H4957</a></a>]]

are also allowed to contract with the Federal Government to receive 
those dollars. That is why Federal law prohibits every single Member of 
this body from contracting with the Federal Government.
  At the time, it was thought that there was no need to include the 
President, Vice President, or members of the Cabinet in this statutory 
prohibition because every recent executive had voluntarily divested of 
their financial conflicts of interest. Unfortunately, that trend of 
presidential transparency was broken by the last administration. If we 
have learned anything from Donald Trump, it is that we can no longer 
rely on norms and tradition to ensure our elected officials do the 
right thing.

                              {time}  1730

  In 2014, the General Services Administration awarded The Trump 
Organization a contract to operate a hotel in the taxpayer-owned Old 
Post Office Pavilion. A provision in that contract specifically stated 
that no elected official of the Government of the United States shall 
be admitted to any share or part of this lease or to any benefit that 
may arise therefrom.
  Despite this clear and unambiguous prohibition, the GSA shockingly 
declared that the President of the United States could continue to 
operate this hotel on Federal Government property and personally 
benefit from the proceeds of that operation.
  As a result, it was easier than ever for foreign governments and 
special interests to put money directly into President Trump&#x27;s pocket. 
Just ask Saudi Arabia, which reportedly spent $270,000 at the Trump 
Hotel in 2017, or the island nation of Cyprus, which hosted a ``Justice 
for Cyprus&#x27;&#x27; conference there, or the Iraqi sheikh who spent tens of 
thousands of dollars staying 26 nights at the hotel.
  The solution to this problem is very simple. My amendment simply 
inserts ``the President, Vice President, and any Cabinet member&#x27;&#x27; into 
the existing statutory prohibition on Members of Congress contracting 
with the Federal Government.
  With the addition of these eight words, we can ensure that every 
elected official is free from the conflict of interest associated with 
both deciding who gets Federal contracts and then benefiting from those 
contracts.
  The American people deserve to know their President is working for 
them, not to line their own pockets.
  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and hold the 
President, Vice President, and members of the Cabinet to the same 
standard of conduct we hold ourselves.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized 
for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  This amendment would prohibit the President, Vice President, and 
Cabinet members from contracting with the Federal Government. The 
amendment adds broad new language to the criminal code and could 
discourage people from entering Federal service. We should want and 
encourage the most qualified people to run for office and serve in our 
Federal Government.
  This amendment is completely outside the scope of the NDAA and 
nothing more than a desperate attempt to score political points. This 
is the kind of unrelated amendment that does not belong in the NDAA.
  We are now 8 months into the Biden administration, yet Democrats 
continue to push legislation, as mentioned by the previous speaker, 
that is targeted at the Trump administration.
  But what else can Democrats talk about? Rising inflation caused by 
President Biden&#x27;s failed economic policies? Rising crime caused by 
Democrats defunding the police? The Biden border crisis?
  If Democrats were serious about ethics reform, they would carefully 
consider this as a standalone bill. Instead, they choose to slap it 
onto an unrelated bill with no discussion or thought. This amendment 
and provision should go through regular order so Members have the 
opportunity to debate and consider ethics reforms.
  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BOWMAN. Mr. Speaker, to my colleagues who oppose this amendment, 
I ask this simple question: If they think the President should be 
allowed to contract with the Federal Government, do they support 
repealing the current statute that prohibits every Member of the body 
from contracting with the Federal Government?
  Of course they don&#x27;t. That would be outrageous.
  My amendment is common sense. It will apply to any President, 
regardless of party affiliation. It will help restore integrity to the 
Office of the President by closing the door on self-enrichment at the 
White House. And it will prevent some of the corruption that defined 
the Trump Presidency from ever happening again.
  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and impose the same 
standards of conduct we imposed on ourselves to every federally elected 
official.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, this is not the bill for this amendment, 
and it certainly should go through the process and be given the 
consideration and discussion due true ethics reforms instead of 
amendments that simply target the former President and his 
administration.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendment offered by the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. Bowman).
  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Bowman).
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appear to have it.
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and 
nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/8">House Resolution 
8</a>, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.

                   VETERANS OF THE WAR IN VIETNAM.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) Korean and Korean-American veterans of the war in 
     Vietnam served honorably throughout the conflict, fighting 
     valiantly both as a part of and alongside the United States 
     Armed Forces and often making the ultimate sacrifice, with 
     many later becoming United States citizens.
       (2) Military cooperation in the Vietnam War is one of 
     several examples that demonstrate the robust alliance of the 
     United States and South Korea, under shared commitment to 
     democratic principles.
       (3) During the Vietnam conflict, more than 3,000,000 
     members of the United States Armed Forces fought bravely to 
     preserve and defend these ideals, among them many Korean 
     Americans who earned citations for their heroism and 
     honorable service.
       (4) South Korea joined the Vietnam conflict to support the 
     United States Armed Forces and the cause of freedom at the 
     request of the United States.
       (5) From 1964 until the last soldier left Saigon on March 
     23, 1973, 325,517 members of South Korea&#x27;s armed forces 
     served in Vietnam, the largest contribution of troops sent by 
     an ally of the United States.
       (6) South Korean forces fought bravely throughout the 
     theater and were known for their dedication, tenacity, and 
     effectiveness on the battlefield.
       (7) More than 17,000 Korean soldiers were injured, and over 
     4,400 Korean soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice in defense 
     of United States friends and allies.
       (8) There are approximately 3,000 naturalized Korean 
     Americans who served in the Vietnam War currently living in 
     the United States, many of whom suffer from significant 
     injuries due to their service in Vietnam, including post-
     traumatic stress disorder, total disability, and the effects 
     of the toxic defoliant Agent Orange.
       (9) Korean-American veterans of the Vietnam conflict upheld 
     the highest ideals of the United States through their 
     dedicated service and considerable sacrifices, with many 
     continuing to carry the visible and invisible wounds of war 
     to this day.
       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
     Korean and Korean-American veterans who served alongside the 
     United States Armed Forces in the Vietnam war fought with 
     honor and valor.

          amendment no. 233 offered by mr. lamborn of colorado

       Add at the end of subtitle A of title XVI the following new 
     section:

     SEC. 16__. LEVERAGING COMMERCIAL ON-ORBIT SATELLITE 
                   SERVICING.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) National security depends on reliable access to, and 
     safe operations in, space. Modern society is reliant on space 
     operations, but most spacecraft today are designed to be 
     discarded at end-of-mission, leaving potential gaps in 
     mission continuity and contributing to risk in the space 
     domain.
       (2) Existing and future critical Department of Defense 
     missions operating in space and providing multidomain support 
     would benefit from the application of commercial On-orbit 
     Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (in this section 
     referred to as ``OSAM&#x27;&#x27;) capabilities, which extend the 
     longevity and operability of national security space systems 
     through inspection, repair, refueling, and mitigation of 
     debris.
       (3) Because the domain in which space systems operate is 
     increasingly congested, the risk of collisions and orbital 
     debris generation has increased, a risk that is exacerbated 
     by a lack of utilization of OSAM services. A secure, stable, 
     and accessible space domain is paramount to the unimpeded and 
     resilient operations of civil, military, intelligence, and 
     commercial space assets by the United States and its allies. 
     OSAM technologies support Department of Defense strategy by 
     improving the adaptability and efficiency of existing and 
     future military space architectures.
       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) Congress strongly encourages the Secretary of Defense 
     to invest in developing technologies to support the 
     advancement of debris remediation, such as rendezvous, 
     proximity operations, and debris removal as an element of 
     OSAM;
       (2) because of the importance of the space domain, the 
     Secretary should seek ways to collaborate with United States 
     industry partners and allied nations;
       (3) beyond technology development, the Secretary and the 
     intelligence community should consider satellite servicing 
     and active disposal as a viable operational trade-off--in 
     this way, in the future, a back-up disposal plan using direct 
     retrieval should be a preferred and viable method for 
     relevant or off-nominal missions.

     the following:

     SEC. 10__. COST ANALYSIS REPORT ON CHANGES TO MILITARY 
                   PRIORITIES.

       Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this 
     Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committee 
     on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the 
     House of Representatives and the Committee on Armed Services 
     and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report 
     on--
       (1) the estimated cost savings as a result of a full 
     drawdown of United States personnel and contractors from 
     Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria compared with actual costs for 
     such personnel and contractors in fiscal year 2021; and
       (2) the estimated cost of redirecting United States 
     personnel and materials, including increased budget authority 
     for ships, aircraft, nuclear weapons, major personnel, and 
     operational costs, to effectively engage in great power 
     competition with Russia and China to effectively curb and 
     deter Russia and China militarily in their respective 
     regions.

  Mr. SMITH of Washington (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that the reading of the modification be dispensed 
with.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Washington?
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the original request 
of the gentleman from Washington?
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The amendment is modified.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith).
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the en bloc package, 
which contains amendment No. 384 to create four critical technology 
security centers.
  These centers would be created through competitive grants issued by 
the Department of Homeland Security to universities or federally funded 
research and development centers, including national laboratories.
  Each center would have a different focus, with the first four 
covering network technology, network industrial control systems, open 
source software, and Federal critical software, respectively.
  Each center would rigorously test the security of a set of 
technologies developed with input from the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, the compromise of which would 
represent the highest level of risk to our critical infrastructure.
  With respect to those specific technologies, centers would evaluate 
their overall security posture; develop new tools and capabilities for 
vulnerability discovery, management, and mitigation; and support the 
remediation of the vulnerabilities they find.
  This is an important recommendation of the Cyberspace Solarium 
Commission, and I thank my fellow Commissioner, Mr. Gallagher, for 
cosponsoring this amendment. I also thank Chairman Thompson for his 
support of the measure. I urge Members to support the en bloc package 
and the underlying bill.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, this en bloc package was put together in close 
consultation with the minority. I urge all Members to support it.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, and I thank the 
ranking member for his support, longtime friends.
  Let me quickly indicate that as I have embraced the NDAA over the 
years, it has always been my focus to deal with the military personnel 
and to make us the best, the strongest, and the most well respected and 
appreciated.
  I want to thank this committee and the Rules Committee for allowing 
my amendments Nos. 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, and 198. Many of 
them speak for themselves.
  Let me clearly say that I have worked year after year as a breast 
cancer survivor to ensure that triple-negative breast cancer, which is 
one of the most deadly forms of cancer--that women in the military have 
the services that they need.
  Let me just share with you that triple-negative breast cancer has a 
survival rate of 5 years. The key to beating this cancer is early 
detection. There is $10 million to enhance research and to help these 
women. In addition, I have asked for $2 million for post-traumatic 
stress disorder. I even, under then-Colonel Murtha, organized a center 
in my district.
  But the most important point for supporting this amendment is that it 
still exists--Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, 11 to 20 
out of 100; Gulf war, 12 out of 100; Vietnam war, 30 out of 100. It is 
still needed, and we appreciate this amendment.
  I also want to thank you for recognizing that we are going into 
space. My amendment says that we should have a bill that studies the 
risks proposed by man-made space debris in lower orbit, including 
recommendations and remediation of such risks. It is extremely 
important.
  Finally, I want to speak to a very important amendment dealing with 
the longstanding history of African Americans in the United States 
military, to create a task force that respects the fact that Crispus 
Attucks, a runaway slave who escaped--during the Boston Massacre to the 
present day--an escaped slave who fought in the Revolutionary War with 
George Washington.
  This story is a long-story story. The United States Army and others 
have a very long history. This task force will determine the impact of 
slavery and the impact of our soldiers from the very early years, who 
happened to be ex-slaves fighting all the way through the many 
different wars.
  I believe we will find that those who are descendants of enslaved 
Africans have fought in wars from the very beginning. It is an 
important story. It should be told. I am very pleased that this 
particular amendment is included.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 
seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I will just conclude that this task 
force, which will be a very significant historical study, will be very 
much appreciated.
  But let me quickly say that having worked with our various nominees 
to the military academies, one in particular was an individual who 
stuttered. By the time he finished, they said he could not have his 
command. They never assessed him in the academy while he was there.
  I believe this is an important assessment, to assess that vital 
$250,000 student, so that when he graduates, he will have a command 
even if he is a stutterer because he made it into the academy; he was 
successful academically; and he should be allowed to serve his country.
  I thank you for considering my amendments and for them to stay in to 
become law.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my Amendments in the En Bloc 
Amendment No. 2 to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 4350</a>, the National Defense Authorization Act

practices and conventions for military installations, infrastructure, 
vessels, and weapon systems.
  Jackson Lee Amendment 191 provides authorization for a $10 million 
increase in funding for increased collaboration with NIH to combat 
Triple Negative Breast Cancer.
  As a Member of Congress, a mother, a sister, a spouse, and a breast 
cancer survivor, I feel a special responsibility to do all I can to 
ensure every American can win in the fight against all types of breast 
cancer but especially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).


                 What is triple negative breast cancer?

  The term triple negative breast cancer refers to the fact that this 
form of breast cancer will test negative, which means that each of the 
tests will return negative results for the presence of breast cancer 
for three types of breast cancer tests:
  Estrogen receptor;
  Progesterone receptor; and
  Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 or the HER2 test will be 
negative.
  In addition, triple-negative breast cancer:
  Tends to be more aggressive than other types of breast cancer;
  Five-year survival rates also tend to be lower for triple-negative 
breast cancer; and
  Triple Negative Breast Cancer tends to be higher grade than other 
types of breast cancer.
  Studies have shown that triple-negative breast cancer is more likely 
to spread beyond the breast and more likely to recur (come back) after 
treatment.
  For example, a study of more than 1,600 women in Canada published in 
2007 found that women with triple-negative breast cancer were at higher 
risk of having the cancer recur outside the breast--but only for the 
first 3 years.
  As years go by, the risks of the triple-negative breast cancer 
recurring become similar to those risk levels for other types of breast 
cancer.
  The key to beating this cancer is not just early detection--but 
detection period.
  A 2007 study of more than 50,000 women with all stages of breast 
cancer found that 77 percent of women with triple-negative breast 
cancer survived at least 5 years, versus 93 percent of women with other 
types of breast cancer.
  Another study of more than 1,600 women published in 2007 found that 
women with triple-negative breast cancer had a higher risk of death 
within 5 years of diagnosis, but not after that time period.
  The recurrence and survival figures in these and other studies are 
averages for all women with triple-negative breast cancer.
  Factors such as the grade and stage of the breast cancer will 
influence an individual woman&#x27;s prognosis.
  About 15-20 percent of breast cancers are triple negative.
  Triple Negative tumors tend to occur more often in younger women and 
African-American women.
  In studies of U.S. and British women, triple negative breast cancer 
appears to be more common among black women (especially before 
menopause) compared to white women.
  Triple negative breast cancer may also be more common among Hispanic 
women compared to white women.
  Although the reasons for racial/ethnic differences in rates of triple 
negative breast cancer are not clear, lifestyle factors may play a 
role.
  For example, some findings show African-American women tend to have 
lower rates of breastfeeding compared to other women, which may 
increase the chances of having triple negative breast cancer.
  For these individuals and the tens of thousands of survivors and 
their daughters this amendment is needed.
  Jackson Lee Amendment 192 provides authorization for $2.5 million 
increase in funding to combat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
  PTSD was first brought to public attention in relation to war 
veterans, but it can result from a variety of traumatic incidents, such 
as torture, being kidnapped or held captive, bombings, or natural 
disasters such as floods or earthquakes.
  People with PTSD may startle easily, become emotionally numb 
(especially in relation to people with whom they used to be close), 
lose interest in things they used to enjoy, have trouble feeling 
affectionate, be irritable, become more aggressive, or even become 
violent.
  They avoid situations that remind them of the original incident, and 
anniversaries of the incident are often very difficult.
  Most people with PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma in their thoughts 
during the day and in nightmares when they sleep. These are called 
flashbacks. A person having a flashback may lose touch with reality and 
believe that the traumatic incident is happening all over again.
  My amendment recognizes that these soldiers are, first and foremost, 
human. They carry their experiences with them.
  Ask a veteran of Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan about the frequency of 
nightmares they experience, and one will realize that serving in the 
Armed Forces leaves a lasting impression, whether good or bad.
  According to the National Center for PTSD, the number of Veterans 
with PTSD varies by service era:
  Operations Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Enduring Freedom (OEF): About 11-
20 out of every 100 Veterans (or between 11-20 percent) who served in 
OIF or OEF have PTSD in a given year.
  Gulf War (Desert Storm): About 12 out of every 100 Gulf War Veterans 
(or 12 percent) have PTSD in a given year.
  Vietnam War: It is estimated that about 30 out of every 100 (or 30 
percent) of Vietnam Veterans have had PTSD in their lifetime.
  Another cause of PTSD in the military can be military sexual trauma 
(MST). This is any sexual harassment or sexual assault that occurs 
while you are in the military.
  MST can happen to both men and women and can occur during peacetime, 
training, or war.
  Among Veterans who use VA health care, about:
  23 out of 100 women (or 23 percent) reported sexual assault when in 
the military.
  55 out of 100 women (or 55 percent) and 38 out of 100 men (or 38 
percent) have experienced sexual harassment when in the military.
  My amendment will help ensure that ``no soldier is left behind&#x27;&#x27; by 
addressing the urgent need for more outreach toward hard-to-reach 
veterans suffering from PTSD, especially those who are homeless or 
reside in underserved urban and rural areas of our country.
  Jackson Lee Amendment <plus-minus>194 recognizes that Black men and 
women have played an integral role in the defense of the nation, from 
the bravery of Crispus Attucks, an escaped slave, during the Boston 
Massacre to the present day, and seeks to determine how to address the 
historical and current barriers to their participation and equal 
treatment in the Armed Services.
  Black Americans became pilots, nurses, Marines, and West Point 
graduates, but it was not until President Harry S. Truman issued an 
executive order in 1948 that the armed services were integrated; and 
even then, some units refused to do so for several more years.
  In 1777, when George Washington faced a dearth of white soldiers 
willing to fight on behalf of the colonies, he allowed Black men to 
fight in the continental army and during the harsh winter of 1778 the 
Rhode Island Assembly, therefore, passed a law in 1778 allowing ``every 
able-bodied negro, mulatto, or Indian man slave in this state to 
enlist.&#x27;&#x27;
  100 black soldiers signed up in exchange for their freedom.
  During the Civil War, around 179,000 Black men served in the Union 
army, either in the Army, Navy, or non-combat positions and more than 
40,000 gave the last full measure of devotion to their country.
  Over 125,000 Black soldiers served overseas in the segregated 
military during World

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4987">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4987">H4987</a></a>]]

War II, but the U.S. military remained segregated.
  When Black veterans came home, many found it difficult to get housing 
or jobs because White veterans were given preference.
  The racial inequality and mistreatment of Black men and women that 
has historically permeated our military continues to this day, with 
more than 750 complaints of discrimination by race or ethnicity from 
service members in the fiscal year 2020 alone.
  But discrimination doesn&#x27;t exist just within the military rank-and-
file, as in that same fiscal year, civilians working in the financial, 
technical, and support sectors of the Army, Air Force; and Navy also 
filed 900 complaints of racial discrimination and over 350 complaints 
of discrimination by skin color, data from the U.S. Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission shows.
  According to a report by the Defense Department&#x27;s Diversity and 
Inclusion Board, while the enlisted ranks of the active and reserve 
military were ``slightly more racially and ethnically diverse than its 
U.S. civilian counterparts,&#x27;&#x27; the opposite was true for the officer 
corps.
  With the rise and normalization of white supremacist expression 
during the Trump administration, the concept of restorative justice has 
gained more urgency, garnering the attention of mainstream 
commentators, and illustrating the need for a national reckoning.
  We owe it to those brave men and women who have proven time and time 
again to be an integral part of our military to examine the Armed 
Services&#x27; history of discrimination and to determine the necessary 
steps to repair the harm caused by these inequities.
  Jackson Lee Amendment No. 96 directs that the Secretary of DoD 
provide a report 240 days from enactment of this bill on the risks 
posed by man-made space debris in low-earth orbit, including 
recommendations on remediation of such risks, and outlines of plans to 
reduce the incident of space debris.
  Space debris encompasses both natural and artificial particles.
  This Jackson Lee Amendment would address the risk of man-made space 
debris.
  Man-made objects in Earth&#x27;s orbit that may no longer serve a useful 
function can include nonfunctional spacecraft, abandoned launch vehicle 
stages, mission-related debris and fragmentation debris.
  Space debris travels at speeds up to 17,500 miles per hour is fast 
enough for a small piece of man-made debris to damage a satellite or a 
spacecraft.
  There are more than 20,000 pieces of debris larger than a softball 
orbiting the Earth.
  There are 500,000 pieces of debris the size of a marble or larger.
  There are many millions of pieces of debris that are so small they 
can&#x27;t be tracked.
  NASA tracks more than 500,000 pieces of man-made space debris in 
Earth&#x27;s orbit.
  This amendment seeks a report from the Secretary of Defense on the 
risks posed by man-made space debris, solutions for reducing risks and 
strategies for reducing the incidence of more man-made space debris 
being introduced into space.
  I urge all members to vote for En Bloc Amendment No. 2 and the 
underlying legislation, <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 4350</a>, the National Defense Authorization 
Act for FY 2022

                              {time}  1745

  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert), my longtime friend and colleague.
  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of amendment 165. It 
creates a separate career track for military judges to prevent undue 
influence from command above.
  In the 1970s it was seen that it would be good for trial defense 
attorneys to have a separate track so that they were not rated by the 
same person who was pushing to have a court martial. That created some 
problems and at times some abuses.
  The separation and the creation of a trial defense service served a 
great purpose, but before 2004 each of the judge advocates general of 
the armed services subscribed to the policy that all judge advocates 
should have a broad career and move from job to job. They became quite 
good at all trades but masters of none.
  So junior judge advocates would try a few court martials, then move 
from one job to another. It gave them a broad basis, but it was not 
helpful overall.
  By giving the military judges a separate career track, it will ensure 
avoidance of undue command influence and will give our servicemembers 
the fair trials they deserve. I would encourage everyone to vote for 
this amendment.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi).
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of my amendment, 
which would permit the Secretary of HHS to receive unused and 
oftentimes just about to expire COVID vaccines from States and be able 
to redistribute them to foreign partners or allies.
  Now, my primary legislation before the body in Congress is called 
NOVID. It is a play on words, no more COVID. And this legislation would 
actually establish a program to help vaccinate 60 percent of the 
population of the world&#x27;s 92 poorest countries. I hope that this 
legislation is taken up by this body and supported by the 
administration.
  In the meantime, the very least that we can do is to donate unused 
vaccines from the States. Now, these vaccines are about to expire. They 
are going to be no good in just a matter of months, and so instead of 
allowing them to go to waste, we should donate them abroad.
  This is not only the right thing to do to help to end suffering 
abroad, but it is the smart thing to do because then it helps to 
prevent variants that are generated abroad from coming back home to the 
United States and further wreaking havoc on our economy.
  On top of that, we see the Chinese Communist Party going around the 
world peddling their ineffective Sinovac vaccine, and we should be 
instead vaccinating those populations with effective vaccines.
  Again, I hope that the administration utilizes this amendment to 
great impact, and I hope that they also do more and endorse my NOVID 
legislation.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Jackson), an outstanding freshman member of 
the Armed Services Committee.
  Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment, which 
clearly states that Israel is a critical defense partner of ours. Our 
national security is inextricably linked to our relationship with and 
our military&#x27;s support for Israel.
  As our strongest ally in the Middle East, it is critical that we 
conduct military exercises with Israel to improve interoperability and 
readiness. We must ensure that Israel has the capabilities it needs to 
defend itself against terrorists with consistent and reliable transfers 
of defense articles.
  Last year, President Trump negotiated the historic Abraham Accords, 
and to honor that, my amendment states clear support for Israel&#x27;s work 
to promote peace. While some in this body have made their disdain for 
the Jewish State of Israel clear, I believe our relationship with 
Israel is nonnegotiable.
  Our friends in Israel are currently questioning our commitment 
because some of my more radical colleagues forced the Speaker to 
withdraw financial support for the Iron Dome yesterday.
  I urge all Members of this body to support my amendment. We must take 
this step to show the only democracy in the Middle East that they can 
count on us for support.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly).
  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of en bloc No. 
2, which includes three amendments I worked on.
  Amendment No. 217 establishes a pilot transition assistance program 
for military spouses, offering similar services to those available for 
members of our Armed Forces.
  This includes mental health first aid training since military spouses 
are well positioned to notice warning signs for any mental health or 
subsequent abuse struggles a new veteran might experience.
  Amendment No. 218 will improve interagency communication as the low 
Earth orbit becomes more crowded with defense, civil, and commercial 
space assets.
  Finally, amendment No. 158 with Representative Gonzales will create a 
National Digital Reserve Corps to bring private sector talent into the 
Federal Government to work on short-term projects. We need more 
cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and developer expertise in the 
Federal Government if we are going to meet the challenges of the 21st 
century.
  I urge my colleagues to support this en bloc.

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4988">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4988">H4988</a></a>]]

  

  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Garcia), an outstanding freshman member 
of our Conference.
  Mr. GARCIA of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my 
critical, bipartisan, bicameral bill, the Military Spouse Licensing 
Relief Act, which was included as an amendment in this en bloc package.
  My amendment would support military families by allowing military 
spouses with valid professional licenses in one State reciprocity in 
another State where their spouse is stationed on military orders. This 
effectively allows the spouse to cross-deck their professional license 
to another State while their spouse is on Active Duty.
  More than 30 percent of our military spouses work in a field 
requiring professional licensing, and when these families receive move 
orders to a new State, military spouses often must spend time and money 
to reapply for a professional license that they already have. On 
average, military families lose thousands of dollars per move in lost 
wages and fees caused by relicensing barriers, and in many cases the 
spouse ends up not even applying for the license because it takes too 
long or is too costly to do so.
  The struggle often threatens the economic security and quality of 
life for these families, as their loved ones serve our Nation. No 
military spouse should have to decide between job security and being 
with their family. Military families already sacrifice so much in 
service to our great country, and we must work to protect these 
families.
  At a time in which our communities are also facing critical shortages 
of skilled professionals, like nurses and teachers, I urge my 
colleagues to support this commonsense amendment that will drastically 
improve the quality of life for our military families as well as our 
communities.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Manning).
  Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the 
bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act, and I urge my colleagues 
to support the bill and my five amendments included in the bill.
  My State of North Carolina is home to eight military bases and more 
than 800,000 Active Duty military servicemembers and veterans.
  The NDAA will give these servicemembers a 2.7 percent pay raise and 
add a crucial level of accountability by taking the prosecution of 
sexual assault and other crimes out of the chain of command.
  I urge support for my amendment requiring the military to consider 
the benefits of using electric vehicles for students at military 
installations. Increased use of electric vehicles by our military will 
help accelerate our transition to clean energy and create good-paying 
jobs in districts like mine.
  This bill also includes my amendments to express concern about the 
safety of Afghan women and girls and to require the Secretary of 
Defense to appoint an official to assist the State Department with 
continued evacuations from Afghanistan. We must do better for the 
people who helped our troops.
  I urge my colleagues to support this act.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).
  Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendments 
that are included in this amendment en bloc number 2 for the National 
Defense Authorization Act.
  This bill includes three amendments that were submitted by my office 
that will directly benefit our Nation&#x27;s security and, of course, the 
people of Puerto Rico.
  The first one is amendment 162, which authorizes research into the 
health effects of nearly 70 years of live fire training in the 
municipality of Vieques.
  As well, amendment 163 supports the Puerto Rico National Guard by 
prohibiting the retirement of the current landing craft ships, or the 
MAG boats, not only used in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria 
in 2019 and that were used again in March of this year. The Puerto Rico 
National Guard has used these ships to provide lifesaving food, water, 
and other equipment to the U.S. Virgin Islands, Vieques, and Culebra 
after any natural disaster. We cannot afford to retire these ships 
until they are replaced.
  Lastly, will be amendment 164, which requires the Secretary of the 
Army to allocate a Modular Small Arms Range to Puerto Rico. This is to 
increase the readiness of the Armed Forces. Right now, Puerto Rico only 
has a single firearms range for the Department of Defense personnel. 
That means that there are numerous scheduling conflicts, and it 
decreases the mission readiness on the island.
  I think those amendments should be supported.
  I want to thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers; I really 
appreciate all their good work on this NDAA. Included in this en bloc 
are numerous provisions for the people of Puerto Rico as a territory.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).
  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the FY22 NDAA.
  As the co-chair of the Democratic Women&#x27;s Caucus, I am proud to see 
two of my amendments, 238 and 239, included as part of this en bloc.
  These amendments would help us understand the factors that influence 
women servicemembers to stay in or leave the military as well as to 
take action to improve mental health outcomes for pregnant veterans.
  Unfortunately, pregnant veterans have been found to be 
disproportionately impacted by mental health disorders and must be 
given adequate support to prevent childbirth complications.
  This language would encourage the VA to support the use of doulas for 
expectant mothers and increase access for doulas for pregnant veterans.
  This is a time we must come together in our support of the growing 
number of women in the military.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), my friend and an outstanding leader on the 
Financial Services Committee.
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the committee and my 
ranking member for the world-class work on this NDAA package.
  This package contains two of my amendments. First, my bipartisan 
bill, <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3146">H.R. 3146</a>, the SAVE Act, passed the House unanimously earlier 
this year, is included as an amendment. The SAVE Act builds on the good 
work of the Armed Services Committee to include important provisions to 
counter China by improving the U.S. supply chain independence and 
security.
  Secondly, this en bloc includes my amendment to require the creation 
of an interagency strategy within the United States Government to 
disrupt and dismantle the production and trafficking of the drug 
Captagon that is being produced by the Syrian regime led by Assad.

                              {time}  1800

  In addition to regularly committing war crimes against his own 
people, the Assad regime is now becoming a narco-state.
  The United States Government must do all it can to disrupt this 
industrial level of production of this drug currently taking place in 
Syria.
  I thank my friends for their support of these amendments, and I urge 
support of this en bloc.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and 
I am prepared to close, therefore, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the amendments 
en bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the 
amendments en bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of en bloc 
package number two for the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022.
  This bill includes three amendments that were submitted by my office 
and will directly benefit the people of Puerto Rico and our Nation&#x27;s 
security.
  Amendment 162 requires the Secretary of Defense to enter into an 
agreement with the National Academy of Sciences for the purpose of 
investigating the health effects on the island Municipality of Vieques 
that may have been

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4989">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H4989">H4989</a></a>]]

caused by toxic waste left after nearly 70 years of live fire training.
  This waste includes heavy metals like lead, cancer-causing fuel 
chemicals, and even depleted uranium. In some locations, areas are so 
contaminated that it is not safe for workers to collect samples.
  While there are numerous studies from different government agencies 
on this topic, including from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Government Accountability Office, much work remains to be done to 
further understand the consequences from this practice.
  I am proud to say that this legislation now builds upon existing 
research for this important topic.
  Amendment number 163 prohibits the Secretary of Defense from retiring 
the Landing Craft ships used by Puerto Rico&#x27;s Army National Guard until 
such time as an adequate replacement is provided.
  These ships delivered critical food, water, and other materials to 
Puerto Rico&#x27;s noncontiguous islands of Vieques and Culebra, as well as 
the US Virgin Islands, following the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.
  The landing craft ships were scheduled to be retired this year, 
however the adopted amendment prohibits this decommissioning until 
replacement equipment arrives to Puerto Rico.
  My third and last amendment, number 164, requires the Secretary of 
the Army to allocate a Modular Small Arms Range to Puerto Rico.
  Currently, Puerto Rico only has a single firearms range for 
Department of Defense personnel.
  This creates numerous scheduling conflicts and decreases mission 
readiness.
  Puerto Rico&#x27;s own Fort Buchanan has the capacity to support a Modular 
Small Arms Range. My office has met with both Army leaders who support 
this request.
  Let me close by noting that <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 4350</a> includes funding over 12 
million dollars in funding for Fort Allen and 10 million for the Ramey 
Unit School, under the energy resilience and conservation program. 
Finally, <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350">H.R. 4350</a> includes 14 million under military construction for 
Fort Buchanan in Puerto Rico. I am appreciative of the Armed Service 
committees work and I look forward to seeing these projects to 
completion.
  I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of en bloc number two.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc, as modified, 
offered by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith).

 TITLE LIV--SAUDI ARABIA ACCOUNTABILITY FOR GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN 
                               RIGHTS ACT

     SEC. 5401. SHORT TITLE.

       This title may be cited as the ``Saudi Arabia 
     Accountability for Gross Violations of Human Rights Act&#x27;&#x27;.

     SEC. 5402. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds the following:
       (1) On October 2, 2018, Washington Post journalist Jamal 
     Khashoggi was murdered by Saudi Government agents in 
     Istanbul.
       (2) According to the United Nations Special Rapporteur&#x27;s 
     June 2019 report, Mr. Khashoggi contacted the Saudi Embassy 
     in Washington regarding required documentation he needed to 
     obtain from Saudi authorities and ``was told to obtain the 
     document from the Saudi embassy in Turkey&#x27;&#x27;.
       (3) According to press reports, Mr. Khashoggi&#x27;s associates 
     were surveilled after having their phones infiltrated by 
     spyware.
       (4) On July 15, 2019, the House of Representatives passed 
     by a margin of 405-7 the Saudi Arabia Human Rights and 
     Accountability Act of 2019 (<a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2037">H.R. 2037</a>), which required--
       (A) an unclassified report by the Director of National 
     Intelligence on parties responsible for Khashoggi&#x27;s murder, a 
     requirement ultimately inserted into and passed as part of 
     the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 
     (Public Law 116-92);
       (B) visa sanctions on all persons identified in such 
     report; and
       (C) a report on human rights in Saudi Arabia.
       (5) On February 26, 2021, the Director of National 
     Intelligence released the report produced pursuant to 
     congressional direction, which stated, ``we assess that Saudi 
     Arabia&#x27;s Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman approved an 
     operation in Istanbul, Turkey to capture or kill Saudi 
     journalist Jamal Khashoggi.&#x27;&#x27;. The report also identified 
     several individuals who ``participated in, ordered, or were 
     otherwise complicit in or responsible for the death of Jamal 
     Khashoggi on behalf of Muhammad bin Salman. We do not know 
     whether these individuals knew in advance that the operation 
     would result in Khashoggi&#x27;s death.&#x27;&#x27;.
       (6) Section 7031(c) of division K of the Consolidated 
     Appropriations Act, 2021 states ``Officials of foreign 
     governments and their immediate family members about whom the 
     Secretary of State has credible information have been 
     involved, directly or indirectly, in. . .a gross violation of 
     human rights. . . shall be ineligible for entry into the 
     United States.&#x27;&#x27;.
       (7) Section 6 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 
     2756) provides that no letters of offer may be issued, no 
     credits or guarantees may be extended, and no export licenses 
     may be issued with respect to any country determined by the 
     President to be engaged in a ``consistent pattern of acts of 
     intimidation or harassment directed against individuals in 
     the United States&#x27;&#x27;.
       (8) Section 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 
     U.S.C. 2304) directs the President to formulate and conduct 
     international security assistance programs of the United 
     States in a manner which will ``promote and advance human 
     rights and avoid identification of the United States, through 
     such programs, with governments which deny to their people 
     internationally recognized human rights and fundamental 
     freedoms, in violation of international law or in 
     contravention of the policy of the United States&#x27;&#x27;.
       (9) Secretary of State Antony Blinken on February 26, 2021, 
     stated: ``As a matter of safety for all within our borders, 
     perpetrators targeting perceived dissidents on behalf of any 
     foreign government should not be permitted to reach American 
     soil. . . We have made absolutely clear that extraterritorial 
     threats and assaults by Saudi Arabia against activists, 
     dissidents, and journalists must end.&#x27;&#x27;.

            Amendment No. 276 Offered by Mr. McCaul of Texas

       Add at the end of subtitle E of title XII the following:

     SEC. 12__. STATEMENT OF CONGRESS REGARDING ONGOING ABUSES 
                   AGAINST UYGHURS.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) On December 9, 1948, the United Nations General 
     Assembly unanimously adopted the Convention on the Prevention 
     and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (the Genocide 
     Convention) signifying a commitment in response to the 
     Holocaust and other crimes against humanity committed in the 
     first half of the twentieth century.
       (2) The Genocide Convention entered into force on January 
     12, 1951, and declares that all state parties ``confirm that 
     genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of 
     war, is a crime under international law which they undertake 
     to prevent and to punish&#x27;&#x27;.
       (3) The Genocide Convention defines genocide as ``any of 
     the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole 
     or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, 
     as such: (a) Killing members of the group; (b) Causing 
     serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) 
     Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life 
     calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole 
     or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births 
     within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the 
     group to another group&#x27;&#x27;.
       (4) The United States ratified the Genocide Convention with 
     the understanding that the commission of genocide requires 
     ``the specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial 
     part, a [protected] group as such&#x27;&#x27;.
       (5) The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) is a state party 
     to the Genocide Convention.
       (6) Since 2017, the PRC Government, under the direction and 
     control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), has detained 
     and sought to indoctrinate more than one million Uyghurs and 
     members of other ethnic and religious minority groups.
       (7) Recent data indicate a significant drop in birth rates 
     among Uyghurs due to enforced sterilization, enforced 
     abortion, and more onerous birth quotas for Uyghurs compared 
     to Han.
       (8) There are credible reports of PRC Government campaigns 
     to promote marriages between Uyghurs and Han and to reduce 
     birth rates among Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims.
       (9) Many Uyghurs reportedly have been assigned to factory 
     employment under conditions that indicate forced labor, and 
     some former detainees have reported food deprivation, 
     beatings, suppression of religious practices, family 
     separation, and sexual abuse.
       (10) This is indicative of a systematic effort to eradicate 
     the ethnic and cultural identity and religious beliefs, and 
     prevent the births of, Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs and Kyrgyz, 
     and members of religious minority groups.
       (11) The birth rate in the Xinjiang region fell by 24 
     percent in 2019 compared to a 4.2 percent decline nationwide.
       (12) On January 19, 2021, the Department of State 
     determined the PRC Government, under the direction and 
     control of the CCP, has committed crimes against humanity and 
     genocide against Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious 
     minority groups in Xinjiang.
       (13) Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Former Secretary 
     of State Michael Pompeo have both stated that what has taken 
     place in Xinjiang is genocide and constitutes crimes against 
     humanity.
       (14) Article VIII of the Genocide Convention provides, 
     ``Any Contracting Party may call upon the competent organs of 
     the United Nations to take such action under the Charter of 
     the United Nations as they consider appropriate for the 
     prevention and suppression of acts of genocide&#x27;&#x27;.
       (15) The International Court of Justice has stated that it 
     is the obligation of all state parties to the Genocide 
     Convention to ``employ all means reasonably available to 
     them, so as to prevent genocide so far as possible&#x27;&#x27;.
       (16) The United States is a Permanent Member of the United 
     Nations Security Council.
       (b) Statement of Congress.--Congress--
       (1) finds that the ongoing abuses against Uyghurs and 
     members of other ethnic and religious minority groups 
     constitute genocide as defined in the Genocide Convention and 
     crimes against humanity as understood under customary 
     international law;
       (2) attributes these atrocity crimes against Uyghurs and 
     members of other ethnic and religious minority groups to the 
     People&#x27;s Republic of China, under the direction and control 
     of the Chinese Communist Party;
       (3) condemns this genocide and these crimes against 
     humanity in the strongest terms; and
       (4) calls upon the President to direct the United States 
     Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the 
     voice, vote, and influence of the United States to--
       (A) refer the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s genocide and 
     crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and members of other 
     ethnic and religious minority groups to the competent organs 
     of the United Nations for investigation;
       (B) seize the United Nations Security Council of the 
     circumstances of this genocide and crimes against humanity 
     and lead efforts to invoke multilateral sanctions in response 
     to these ongoing atrocities; and
       (C) take all possible actions to bring this genocide and 
     these crimes against humanity to an end and hold the 
     perpetrators of these atrocities accountable under 
     international law.

     SEC. 7102. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IMPORTANCE OF DEPARTMENT OF 
                   STATE&#x27;S WORK.

       It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) United States global engagement is key to a stable and 
     prosperous world;
       (2) United States leadership is indispensable in light of 
     the many complex and interconnected threats facing the United 
     States and the world;
       (3) diplomacy and development are critical tools of 
     national power, and full deployment of these tools is vital 
     to United States national security;
       (4) challenges such as the global refugee and migration 
     crises, terrorism, historic famine and food insecurity, and 
     fragile or repressive societies cannot be addressed without 
     sustained and robust United States diplomatic and development 
     leadership;
       (5) the United States Government must use all of the 
     instruments of national security and foreign policy at its 
     disposal to protect United States citizens, promote United 
     States interests and values, and support global stability and 
     prosperity;
       (6) United States security and prosperity depend on having 
     partners and allies that share our interests and values, and 
     these partnerships are nurtured and our shared interests and 
     values are promoted through United States diplomatic 
     engagement, security cooperation, economic statecraft, and 
     assistance that helps further economic development, good 
     governance, including the rule of law and democratic 
     institutions, and the development of shared responses to 
     natural and humanitarian disasters;
       (7) as the United States Government agencies primarily 
     charged with conducting diplomacy and development, the 
     Department and the United States Agency for International 
     Development (USAID) require sustained and robust funding to 
     carry out this important work, which is essential to our 
     ability to project United States leadership and values and to 
     advance United States interests around the world;
       (8) the work of the Department and USAID makes the United 
     States and the world safer and more prosperous by alleviating 
     global poverty and hunger, fighting HIV/AIDS and other 
     infectious diseases, strengthening alliances, expanding 
     educational opportunities for women and girls, promoting good 
     governance and democracy, supporting anti-corruption efforts, 
     driving economic development and trade, preventing armed 
     conflicts and humanitarian crises, and creating American jobs 
     and export opportunities;
       (9) the Department and USAID are vital national security 
     agencies, whose work is critical to the projection of United 
     States power and leadership worldwide, and without which 
     Americans would be less safe, United States economic power 
     would be diminished, and global stability and prosperity 
     would suffer;
       (10) investing in diplomacy and development before 
     conflicts break out saves American lives while also being 
     cost-effective; and
       (11) the contributions of personnel working at the 
     Department and USAID are extraordinarily valuable and allow 
     the United States to maintain its leadership around the 
     world.

     SEC. 7108. IMPORTANCE OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS TRAINING TO NATIONAL 
                   SECURITY.

       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) the Department is a crucial national security agency, 
     whose employees, both Foreign and Civil Service, require the 
     best possible training at every stage of their careers

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H5001">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H5001">H5001</a></a>]]

     to prepare them to promote and defend United States national 
     interests and the health and safety of United States citizens 
     abroad;
       (2) the Department of State&#x27;s investment of time and 
     resources with respect to the training and education of its 
     personnel is considerably below the level of other Federal 
     departments and agencies in the national security field, and 
     falls well below the investments many allied and adversarial 
     countries make in the development of their diplomats;
       (3) the Department faces increasingly complex and rapidly 
     evolving challenges, many of which are science and 
     technology-driven, and which demand the continual, high-
     quality training and education of its personnel;
       (4) the Department must move beyond reliance on ``on-the-
     job training&#x27;&#x27; and other informal mentorship practices, which 
     lead to an inequality in skillset development and career 
     advancement opportunities, often particularly for minority 
     personnel, and towards a robust professional tradecraft 
     training continuum that will provide for greater equality in 
     career advancement and increase minority participation in the 
     senior ranks;
       (5) the Department&#x27;s Foreign Service Institute and other 
     training facilities should seek to substantially increase its 
     educational and training offerings to Department personnel, 
     including developing new and innovative educational and 
     training courses, methods, programs, and opportunities; and
       (6) consistent with existing Department gift acceptance 
     authority and other applicable laws, the Department and 
     Foreign Service Institute may accept funds and other 
     resources from foundations, not-for-profit corporations, and 
     other appropriate sources to help the Department and the 
     Institute enhance the quantity and quality of training 
     offerings, especially in the introduction of new, innovative, 
     and pilot model courses.
       (b) Training Float.--Not later than 90 days after the date 
     of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall 
     develop and submit to the appropriate congressional 
     committees a strategy to establish a ``training float&#x27;&#x27; to 
     allow for up to 15 percent of the Civil and Foreign Service 
     to participate in long-term training at any given time. The 
     strategy should identify steps necessary to ensure 
     implementation of the training priorities identified in 
     subsection (c), sufficient training capacity and 
     opportunities are available to Civil and Foreign Service 
     officers, equitable distribution of long-term training 
     opportunities to Civil and Foreign Service officers, and any 
     additional resources or authorities necessary to facilitate 
     such a training float, including programs at the George P. 
     Schultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center, the Foreign 
     Service Institute, the Foreign Affairs Security Training 
     Center, and other facilities or programs operated by the 
     Department of State. The strategy shall identify which types 
     of training would be prioritized, the extent (if any) to 
     which such training is already being provided to Civil and 
     Foreign Service officers by the Department of State, any 
     factors incentivizing or disincentivizing such training, and 
     why such training cannot be achieved without Civil and 
     Foreign Service officers leaving the workforce. In addition 
     to training opportunities provided by the Department, the 
     strategy shall consider training that could be provided by 
     the other United States Government training institutions, as 
     well as non-governmental educational institutions. The 
     strategy shall consider approaches to overcome disincentives 
     to pursuing long-term training.
       (c) Prioritization.--In order to provide the Civil and 
     Foreign Service with the level of education and training 
     needed to effectively advance United States interests across 
     the globe, the Department of State should--
       (1) increase its offerings--
       (A) of virtual instruction to make training more accessible 
     to personnel deployed throughout the world; or
       (B) at partner organizations to provide useful outside 
     perspectives to Department personnel;
       (2) offer courses utilizing computer-based or assisted 
     simulations, allowing civilian officers to lead decision-
     making in a crisis environment; and
       (3) consider increasing the duration and expanding the 
     focus of certain training courses, including--
       (A) the A-100 orientation course for Foreign Service 
     officers, and
       (B) the chief of mission course to more accurately reflect 
     the significant responsibilities accompanying such role.
       (d) Other Agency Responsibilities.--Other national security 
     agencies should increase the enrollment of their personnel in 
     courses at the Foreign Service Institute and other Department 
     of State training facilities to promote a whole-of-government 
     approach to mitigating national security challenges.

       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
     the Department&#x27;s Bureau of Overseas Building Operations (OBO)

     any new United States embassy compound or new consulate 
     compound project that utilizes a non-standard design, 
     including those projects that are in the design or pre-design

     committees, for each such project, the following 
     documentation:

     the project to the estimated full lifecycle costs of such 
     project if it were to use a standard design.

     project to the estimated completion date of such project if 
     it were to use a standard design.

     to the security of such completed project if it were to use a 
     standard design.
       (4) A justification for the Secretary&#x27;s selection of a non-
     standard design over a standard design for such project.
       (5) A written explanation if any of the documentation 
     necessary to support the comparisons and justification, as 
     the case may be, described in paragraphs (1) through (4) 
     cannot be provided.

     sense of Congress that the Secretary of State should continue 
     to hold entry-level classes for Foreign Service officers and 
     specialists and continue to recruit civil servants through 
     programs such as the Presidential Management Fellows Program 
     and Pathways Internship Programs in a manner and at a 
     frequency consistent with prior years and consistent with the 
     need to maintain a pool of experienced personnel effectively 
     distributed across skill codes and ranks. It is further the 
     sense of Congress that absent continuous recruitment and 
     training of Foreign Service officers and civil servants, the 
     Department of State will lack experienced, qualified 
     personnel in the short, medium, and long terms.
       (b) Limitation.--The Secretary of State should not

     workforce reduction enhances the effectiveness of the 
     Department;

     national interest of the United States;

     Department, including 5-year workforce forecasting and a 
     description of the anticipated impact of any proposed

                   THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE.

       (1) the Department of State should continue to promote the 
     employment of veterans, in accordance with section 301 of the

     veterans belonging to traditionally under-represented groups

     significant contributions to United States foreign policy in

     employment and facilitate their participation in the 
     workforce.

     SEC. 7311. EMPLOYEE ASSIGNMENT RESTRICTIONS AND PRECLUSIONS.

     the Department of State should expand the appeal process it 
     makes available to employees related to assignment 
     preclusions and restrictions.
       (b) Appeal of Assignment Restriction or Preclusion.--
     Subsection (a) of section 414 of the Department of State 
     Authorities Act, Fiscal Year 2017 (22 U.S.C. 2734c(a)) is 
     amended by adding at the end the following new sentences:

     thereto shall also apply to any recommendation or decision to 
     impose an assignment restriction or preclusion to an 
     employee.
       (d) Annual Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date 
     of the enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the

     Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations and 
     the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate a report that 
     contains the following:
       (1) A rationale for the use of assignment restrictions by 
     the Department of State, including specific case studies 
     related to cleared American Foreign Service and civil service 
     employees of the Department that demonstrate country-specific 
     restrictions serve a counterintelligence role beyond that 
     which is already covered by the security clearance process.
       (2) The number of such Department employees subject to 
     assignment restrictions over the previous year, with data

     unused language skills as measured by Foreign Service

     and contracted investigators, with accompanying data on 
     results.

     SEC. 7312. RECALL AND REEMPLOYMENT OF CAREER MEMBERS.

       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) career Department of State employees provide invaluable 
     service to the United States as nonpartisan professionals who 
     contribute subject matter expertise and professional skills 
     to the successful development and execution of United States 
     foreign policy; and
       (2) reemployment of skilled former members of the Foreign 
     and civil service who have voluntarily separated from the 
     Foreign or civil service due to family reasons or to obtain 
     professional skills outside government is of benefit to the 
     Department.

       (4) There is a progressive and increasing rise in 
     interaction between human populations and wildlife related to 
     deforestation, habitat degradation, and expansion of human 
     activity into the habitat of such wildlife.
       (5) The increase in such interactions due to these factors, 
     particularly in forested regions of tropical countries where 
     there is high mammalian diversity, is a serious risk factor 
     for spillover events.
       (6) A serious risk factor for spillover events also relates 
     to the collection, production, commercial trade, and sale for 
     human consumption of wildlife that may transmit to zoonotic 
     pathogens to humans that may then replicate and be 
     transmitted within the human population.
       (7) Such a risk factor is increased if it involves wildlife 
     that--
       (A) does not ordinarily interact with humans; or
       (B) lives under a stressful condition, as such condition 
     exacerbates the shedding of zoonotic pathogens.
       (8) Markets for such wildlife to be sold for human 
     consumption are found in many countries.
       (9) In some communities, such wildlife may be the only 
     accessible source of high quality nutrition.
       (10) The public health emergency has resulted in--
       (A) trillions of dollars in economic damage to the United 
     States; and
       (B) the deaths of hundreds of thousands of American 
     citizens.

       Amendment No. 349 offered by Ms. pressley of massachusetts

       In title LX, add at the end the following:

     SEC. 6013. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE USE OF THE DEFENSE 
                   PRODUCTION ACT OF 1950 FOR GLOBAL VACCINE 
                   PRODUCTION.

       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
       (1) As President Biden has stated, ``We know America will 
     never be fully safe until the pandemic that is raging 
     globally is under control. No ocean is wide enough, no wall 
     is high enough to keep us safe.&#x27;&#x27;.
       (2) More than 600,000 Americans have already died from 
     COVID-19. Already, more Americans have died from COVID-19 
     than from World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, and 9/
     11 combined. The continued replication of SARS-CoV-2 abroad 
     increases the likelihood of a harmful mutation that renders 
     current vaccines ineffective. A new variant could be more 
     transmissible and cause more severe disease, posing a higher 
     risk to the millions of Americans who have not been 
     vaccinated, like the Delta variant.
       (3) Approximately 11 billion doses are needed to vaccinate 
     the world&#x27;s population, but to date, the US government has 
     donated just 40 million doses. More recent promises by the G7 
     would only deliver an additional one billion doses by the end 
     of 2022.
       (4) Sharing manufacturing know-how and expertise is 
     critical to quickly ramping up production. Expanding the 
     world&#x27;s manufacturing capacity is critical because donations 
     and bilateral agreements to increase vaccine doses in low- 
     and middle-income countries cannot quickly meet the global 
     demand.
       (5) The U.S. Government, as the largest coronavirus 
     research and development funder in the world, is uniquely 
     positioned to push companies to share the knowledge required 
     to end the pandemic.
       (6) Manufacturers around the world have affirmed that they 
     can help ramp up production if they have access to 
     technology. According to the World Health Organization, 19 
     manufacturers from more than a dozen countries in Africa, 
     Asia, and Latin America have expressed interest in ramping up 
     mRNA vaccine production. The Biden administration has also 
     urged companies to share technology. But vaccine originator 
     corporations have been reluctant to share technology.
       (7) The Defense Production Act of 1950 provides the 
     President with broad authority to support the nation&#x27;s 
     defense. The Defense Production Act of 1950&#x27;s definition of 
     ``national defense&#x27;&#x27; includes ``military or critical 
     infrastructure assistance to any foreign nation&#x27;&#x27;.
       (8) The Defense Production Act of 1950 empowers the 
     President to directly ``allocate materials, services, and 
     facilities&#x27;&#x27; to promote national defense needs. The Act 
     defines ``materials&#x27;&#x27; to include ``any technical information 
     or services ancillary to the use of any such materials&#x27;&#x27;.
       (9) The Defense Production Act of 1950 has been used 
     repeatedly to prioritize contracts and orders from U.S. 
     companies to foreign nations.
       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
     the President should make full use of the President&#x27;s 
     authority under the Defense Production Act of 1950 to scale 
     vaccine production and deployment globally, which will save 
     millions of lives and protect Americans from the risk of 
     emerging viral threats.


          Amendment No. 350 offered by Mr. quigley of illinois

                 TITLE LIV--PREVENTING FUTURE PANDEMICS

     SEC. 5401. WILDLIFE MARKET DEFINED.

       In this Act, the term ``wildlife market&#x27;&#x27;--
       (1) means a commercial market that--
       (A) sells or slaughters terrestrial, including avian, 
     wildlife for human consumption as food or medicine, whether 
     the animals originated in the wild or in a captive 
     environment; and
       (B) delivers a product in communities where alternative 
     nutritional or protein sources are available; and
       (2) does not include markets in areas where no other 
     practical alternative sources of protein or meat exists, such 
     as wildlife markets in rural areas on which indigenous people 
     rely to feed themselves and their families.

     SEC. 5402. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION.

       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
     global institutions, including the Food and Agriculture 
     Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World 
     Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and the World Health 
     Organization (WHO), together with leading nongovernmental 
     organizations, veterinary colleges, and the United States 
     Agency for International Development (USAID), should promote 
     the paradigm of One Health--the integration of human health, 
     animal health, agriculture, ecosystems, and the environment 
     as an effective and integrated way to address the complexity 
     of emerging disease threats.
       (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United 
     States to facilitate international cooperation by working 
     with international partners and through intergovernmental, 
     international, and nongovernmental organizations such as the 
     United Nations to--
       (1) lead a resolution at the United Nations Security 
     Council or General Assembly and World Health Assembly 
     outlining the danger to human and animal health from emerging 
     zoonotic infectious diseases, with recommendations for 
     implementing the worldwide closure of wildlife markets and 
     the ending of the associated commercial trade of terrestrial 
     wildlife that feed and supply those markets, except for in 
     such countries or regions where the consumption of wildlife 
     is necessary for local food security or where such actions 
     would significantly disrupt a readily available and 
     irreplaceable food supply;
       (2) work with governments through existing treaties and the 
     United Nations to develop a new protocol or agreement, and 
     amend existing protocols or agreements, regarding stopping 
     deforestation and other ecosystem destruction, closing 
     commercial wildlife markets for human consumption, and end 
     the associated commercial trade of terrestrial wildlife that 
     feed and supply those markets while ensuring full 
     consideration to the needs and rights of indigenous peoples 
     and local communities that are dependent on wildlife for 
     their food security, national sovereignty, and local laws and 
     customs;
       (3) disrupt and ultimately end the commercial international 
     trade in terrestrial wildlife associated with wildlife 
     markets and eliminate commercial wildlife markets;
       (4) disrupt and ultimately eliminate wildlife trafficking 
     associated with the operation of wildlife markets;
       (5) raise awareness on the dangerous potential of wildlife 
     markets as a source of zoonotic diseases such as the novel 
     coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19 and reduce 
     demand for the consumption of wildlife through evidence-based 
     behavior change programs while ensuring that existing 
     wildlife habitat is not encroached upon or destroyed as part 
     of this process;
       (6) encourage and support alternate forms of food 
     production, farming, and shifts to domestic animal- or plant-
     source foods instead of terrestrial wildlife where able and 
     appropriate, and reduce consumer demand for terrestrial 
     wildlife through enhanced local and national food systems, 
     especially in areas

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H5029">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H5029">H5029</a></a>]]

     where wildlife markets play a significant role in meeting 
     subsistence needs while ensuring that existing wildlife 
     habitat is not encroached upon or destroyed as part of this 
     process; and
       (7) strive to increase hygienic standards implemented in 
     markets around the globe, especially those specializing in 
     the sale of products intended for human consumption.

     shall--
       (A) collaboratively with other member states, issue 
     declarations, statements, and communiques urging a global ban 
     on commercial wildlife markets and trade for human 
     consumption; and
       (B) urge increased enforcement of existing laws to end 
     wildlife trafficking.
       (2) International coalitions.--The Secretary of State shall 
     seek to build international coalitions focused on ending 
     commercial wildlife markets for human consumption and 
     associated wildlife trade which feeds and supplies said 
     markets, with a focus on the following efforts:
       (A) Providing assistance and advice to other governments in 
     the adoption of legislation and regulations to close wildlife 
     markets and trade for human consumption.
       (B) Creating economic pressure on wildlife markets and 
     their supply chains to prevent their operation.

1,100 protestors and bystanders were injured.
  This is part of a pattern of human rights violations by President 
Duque. He is also planning to resume aerial fumigation, which most 
countries stopped using when devastating health impacts were 
discovered.
  Our amendments would require the Department of State and Defense to 
issue a report on the State of human rights in Colombia. They would 
also limit the U.S. transfer of weapons to the police unit responsible 
for many of the demonstrators&#x27; murders. And finally, they would 
prohibit U.S. funds from being used to support aerial fumigation.
  Similarly, in 2018 we stood horrified by the Saudi government&#x27;s 
assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi for speaking up against the 
regime&#x27;s human rights abuses.
  Our amendment would prohibit funds from being used to provide 
weapons, military aid, or military training to the unit that carried 
out his assassination.
  The U.S. has long supported abusive regimes in South America and the 
Middle East to serve our own interests, yet we seem somehow shocked and 
confused when refugees from these regions show up at our borders 
seeking asylum from the inhumane conditions that we helped create in 
their homelands.
  It is now beyond time for us to rectify these wrongs, and I submit 
this amendment.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Miller), an outstanding member of 
the Ways and Means Committee.
  Mrs. MILLER of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
bill and my four amendments.
  The first amendment will require a report on the status of women in 
Afghanistan. The rights we fought to secure for them are in dire peril.
  The second will hold the administration accountable by requesting a 
report on the amount of money and materials left behind in Afghanistan.
  The third blocks any funding for intelligence sharing and ensures no 
taxpayer dollars are wasted working with the Taliban. They proved that 
they can&#x27;t be trusted by the deadly events at the airport.
  The final amendment will establish a memorial for the 13 
servicemembers who perished securing the airport.
  They lost their lives protecting Americans and our allies. This 
memorial would ensure that they are never forgotten for their 
sacrifice.
  I urge adoption of all four of my amendments.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H5032">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H5032">H5032</a></a>]]

this time, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), my friend and colleague, and 
also the ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee.
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for the hard work that went into preparing this NDAA.
  I rise today in support of one amendment in particular included in 
this en bloc package, which would add the bipartisan Alexander Lofgren 
Veterans and Parks Act or the VIP Act to the bill.
  The VIP Act would provide free lifetime passes to our national parks 
and public lands for veterans and Gold Star family members and free 
annual passes for active duty military members.
  I am a proud cosponsor of both the amendment and identical 
legislation which passed the House earlier this year with an amazing 
420 in favor to zero against vote with over 150 bipartisan cosponsors. 
Senator Sinema and Senator Boozman from my home State of Arkansas are 
leading the bipartisan Senate companion of this legislation.
  In addition to its broad support here in Congress, the VIP Act has 
also been endorsed by over 60 organizations representing a diverse 
coalition of conservation, recreation, and veterans&#x27; groups.
  In just the past month, as we have watched the horrible situation 
unfolding in Afghanistan, the country has awoken again to the sacrifice 
and heroism displayed by our brave men and women in uniform. These men 
and women often return home carrying both visible and invisible wounds 
from their time in combat.
  During the Biden administration&#x27;s botched evacuation of Afghanistan, 
the VA&#x27;s crisis hotline had a 9 percent uptick in calls. Despite the 
fact that suicide rates among veterans were the lowest in 12 years, an 
average of 17 veterans per day still died by suicide in 2019.
  That is what makes this amendment so vital now more than ever. Our 
outdoors can be a place of healing and hope for our veterans, 
particularly wounded or paralyzed veterans who turn to nature for 
solace and comfort.
  Financial barriers should not be a factor for our veterans as they 
try to access the majestic and iconic parts of our country that they 
fought so hard to defend. Our veterans, active duty military, and Gold 
Star families deserve permanent, free access that can never be taken 
away from them.
  While we can never fully repay the debt we owe to our veterans and 
Gold Star families, this amendment is a small gesture to symbolize 
their sacrifices were not in vain, and that they we will never forget 
their bravery and heroism.
  That is why I am also a strong supporter of an amendment that passed 
in an earlier en bloc passage to locate the Global War on Terrorism 
Memorial on the National Mall here in Washington, D.C.
  Our Nation&#x27;s patriots who selflessly fought to defend this Nation in 
the wake of terror attacks against our homeland deserve nothing less 
than a lasting tribute in our Nation&#x27;s capitol in a place of prominence 
on the National Mall.
  I strongly support the amendment and would urge the eventual NDAA 
conferees to ensure it stays in the final text and will fight to make 
sure that it does.
  Before I conclude, I would be remiss if I didn&#x27;t mention several 
wildfire-related amendments.
  I believe that better pay and benefits for our wildland firefighters 
is both well-deserved and well-earned, but we must address both the 
short- and long-term issues facing our firefighters and Federal lands; 
which means addressing the catastrophic forest health crisis through 
better management.
  Nearly six million acres have burned this year, and States like 
California and Oregon saw some of the largest fires in their State&#x27;s 
history. Fire seasons are getting longer and more intense because of 
our lack of forest management, which in turn puts a heavy physical, 
mental, and emotional strain on our wildland firefighters.
  I would like to extend an invitation to my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle to work on this issue together so that we stop 
putting our firefighters in impossible situations year after year.
  I urge my colleagues to support the Miller-Meeks, Gallego, Westerman, 
and Grijalva amendment.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne), one of our great new freshman 
members of the Republican Conference.
  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this en bloc, 
which includes my friend and colleague Representative Dean Phillips&#x27; 
amendment, which directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on 
the effects of the Department of Defense&#x27;s Cybersecurity Maturity Model 
Certification framework on small business.
  Recognizing the increased cyber vulnerabilities of small contractors, 
the DOD initiated a new cybersecurity assessment framework called the 
Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification to assess contractor 
implementation of cybersecurity requirements.
  While no one disputes the Federal Government&#x27;s need to address the 
growing cybersecurity risks facing our Nation, I am concerned that the 
CMMC has created another hurdle to keep small businesses from competing 
effectively in the defense marketplace.
  There is no question our military relies heavily on the many small 
businesses that make up our defense contracting network, and their 
voices should be heard throughout this process.
  Strong national security and cybersecurity in a thriving defense 
industrial base shouldn&#x27;t be mutually exclusively goals, and I hope 
this amendment will set a clear path forward for our smaller 
contractors.
  I would also like to rise today in support of the following 
amendments en bloc, which includes my supply chain-focused amendment 
that I was proud to introduce with my main colleague, Mr. Golden.
  Now, more than ever, we must ensure our supply chains are protected, 
and with every business I meet, I continue to hear how they are 
experiencing firsthand impacts of supply chain disruptions due to 
COVID-19. And to prevent further disruptions, we must act now to 
identify vulnerabilities. Protecting our supply chain is more than just 
business, it is a matter now of national security.
  My amendment will begin this process by directing the DNI and the CIA 
to identify those critical supply chains to our national security, 
economic security, and public health, as well as recommend necessary 
actions.
  It is my goal, along with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, 
that this amendment will prevent another grave supply chain crisis.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of these two amendments.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry), an outstanding member of the 
Republican Conference and a retired general officer.

                              {time}  1815

  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and appreciate the 
opportunity to introduce this amendment combating illegal CCP dictates 
in the South China Sea.
  Mr. Speaker, on September 1, China&#x27;s Maritime Security Administration 
began to demand that foreign ships report specific vessel information 
before entering the CCP&#x27;s imagined maritime claims.
  This information includes the following: the name and number; the 
satellite telephone number; the position and recent locations; and 
cargo.
  Vessels needing to provide this information include submersibles, 
nuclear vessels, ships carrying radioactive materials, as well as any 
vessel the CCP deems to be a threat, which is, naturally, purposefully 
vague.
  Now, what this is is the Chinese Communist Party literally drew a 
line in the South China Sea and said: You come across it, even though 
you are in international waters, you have to do this.
  No, we don&#x27;t have to do this.

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H5033">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H5033">H5033</a></a>]]

  The United States has repeatedly said we reject all maritime claims 
made by China within the so-called nine-dash line, the 10-dash line, or 
the 11-dash line, or whatever they want to call it, at any time, as 
virtually all of those claims are both imagined and illegal. This 
position was prominently reinforced by former Secretary Pompeo on July 
13, 2020.
  Fortunately, it appears to be the case that the administration agrees 
with this assessment.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this amendment to push back against 
China&#x27;s lawless activity in the South China Sea.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, this en bloc was put together in close consultation by 
the majority with the minority. I urge all Members to support it, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I concur in the remarks of the 
ranking member. I urge support for the en bloc, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Chair for 
his support of my amendment.
  This amendment is based on legislation I have introduced previously, 
the Corey Adams Searchlight Act.
  I want to talk about why this amendment is so important.
  It is about helping services members who have been heroes and have 
given so much for our safety.
  The bill is named after my constituent, Corey Adams.
  Corey always wanted to serve his country and follow in his fathers 
and grandfathers&#x27; footsteps and join the Air Force after high school.
  Corey served 4 years on active duty, then joined the Air Force 
Reserve.
  Sergeant Corey also served six months in Afghanistan in 2009.
  Sergeant Corey Adams was later diagnosed with Post traumatic stress 
disorder and later moved into his parent&#x27;s home in Milwaukee, WI.
  On March 20, 2017 the Adams family was changed forever.
  Segreant Corey Adams was missing.
  His family tried to file a missing persons report soon after he went 
missing,
  It took eight days before the police determined he met the critical 
missing persons criteria, a crucial delay. 18 days after his 
disappearance, Corey Adams&#x27; body was recovered from Dineen Park, one 
mile from his mother&#x27;s home.
  No family should have to suffer a tragedy like this. This Sunday 
would have been Corey&#x27;s 50th birthday.
  In the aftermath of this tragedy, Wisconsin became the first state to 
enact a green alert system to find veterans who are reported missing. 
Delaware, Tennessee, and Texas have since enacted laws to do so, and 
other states are currently looking to do the same.
  When a Veteran goes missing, we should ensure that we have their 6.
  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, my amendment No. 363, which is included in 
En Bloc 3, ensures the 1,700 small businesses in my district can access 
financing through the Small Business Administration&#x27;s micro loan 
program.
  The program is targeted specially to help women, low-income, veteran, 
and minority entrepreneurs.
  The Marianas is the only place in the U.S. not included in the 
program, which provides loans, typically not offered by banks, of up to 
$50,000.
  My bipartisan amendment would correct that by ensuring access to 
microloans on the same basis as their counterparts across the nation.
  I thank Representatives Garbarino, Kahele, and Radewagen for their 
cosponsorship of the amendment.
  I ask my colleagues to support En Bloc 3.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Casten). Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 
667</a>, the previous question is ordered on the amendments en bloc offered 
by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith).
  The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman 
from Washington (Mr. Smith).
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and 
nays.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/8">House Resolution 
8</a>, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question 
are postponed.

Report 117-125</a>, offered by Mr. Smith of Washington:


          amendment no. 366 offered by mr. san nicolas of guam

       In title LI of division E, after section 5105, insert the 
     following:

     SEC. 5106. INCLUDING OF TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND TERRITORIES IN 
                   THE HIGH-RISK MONEY LAUNDERING AND RELATED 
                   FINANCIAL CRIME AREAS.

       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
       (1) According to the Department of Justice, human 
     trafficking is ``a crime that involves exploiting a person 
     for labor, services, or commercial sex&#x27;&#x27;, a global illicit 
     trade that is estimated by Global Financial Integrity to be 
     valued at more than $150.2 billion each year.
       (2) Polaris, the non-governmental organization which runs 
     the United States National Human Trafficking Hotline, has 
     found that while human trafficking is a nationwide problem, 
     the majority of domestic human trafficking victims are 
     ``people who have historically faced discrimination and its 
     political, social and economic consequences: people of color, 
     indigenous communities, immigrants and people who identify as 
     LGBTQ+&#x27;&#x27;.
       (3) For this reason, it is important that law enforcement 
     representing native communities and territories are part of 
     the national dialogue about countering human trafficking.
       (4) The High Intensity Financial Crime Areas program, which 
     is intended to concentrate law enforcement efforts at the 
     Federal, State, and local level to combat money laundering in 
     designated high-intensity money laundering zones, considers 
     human trafficking among other financial crime issues and 
     actors.
       (5) In each High Intensity Financial Crime Area, a money-
     laundering action team, comprised of relevant Federal, State, 
     and local enforcement authorities, prosecutors, and financial 
     regulators, works together to coordinate Federal, State, and 
     local anti-money laundering effort.
       (6) The High Intensity Financial Crime Area program does 
     not currently mandate the inclusion of law enforcement and 
     other agencies from Tribes and territories.
       (7) Further, the National Strategy for Combating Terrorist 
     and Other Illicit Financing, a valuable report which is 
     scheduled to sunset in January 2022, does not currently 
     mandate the inclusion of law enforcement and other agencies 
     from Tribes and Territories.
       (b) National Strategy for Combating Terrorist and Other 
     Illicit Financing.--The Countering Russian Influence in 
     Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 (22 U.S.C. 9501 et seq.) is 
     amended--
       (1) in section 261(b)(2)--

     of the United States&#x27;&#x27; and inserting ``the broader counter 
     terrorism and national security strategies of the United

     finance&#x27;&#x27;;

         amendment no. 368 offered by ms. sanchez of california

       At the end of subtitle A of title XIII, insert the 
     following:

     SEC. 13__. FUNDING FOR THE NATO STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS 
                   CENTER OF EXCELLENCE.

       (a) Increase.--Notwithstanding the amounts set forth in the 
     funding tables in division D, the amount authorized to be

        Amendment No. 406 offered by ms. spanberger of virginia

       At the end of subtitle G of title X insert the following:

     SEC. 10__. ANOMALOUS HEALTH INCIDENTS INTERAGENCY 
                   COORDINATOR.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) Since at least 2016, United States Government personnel 
     and their family members have reported anomalous health 
     incidents at diplomatic missions across the world and in the 
     United States, which are sometimes referred to as ``Havana 
     Syndrome&#x27;&#x27;.
       (2) Some of the anomalous health incidents have resulted in 
     unexplained brain injuries, which have had permanent, life-
     altering effects that have disrupted lives and ended careers.
       (3) A panel of experts convened by the Bureau of Medical 
     Services of the Department of State in July 2017 to review 
     triage assessments of medically evaluated personnel from the 
     United States Embassy in Havana came to a consensus that the 
     findings were most likely related to neurotrauma from a 
     nonnatural source.
       (4) A 2020 report by the National Academy of Sciences found 
     that ``many of the distinctive and acute signs, symptoms, and 
     observations reported by [affected] employees are consistent 
     with the effects of directed, pulsed radio frequency (RF) 
     energy&#x27;&#x27; and that ``directed pulsed RF energy [...] appears 
     to be the most plausible mechanism in explaining these 
     cases&#x27;&#x27;.
       (5) According to the National Academy of Sciences report, 
     ``such a scenario raises grave concerns about a world with 
     disinhibited malevolent actors and new tools for causing harm 
     to others&#x27;&#x27;.
       (6) The number and locations of these suspected attacks 
     have expanded and, according to press reporting, there have 
     been more than 130 possible cases that have been reported by 
     United States personnel in Asia, in Europe, and in the 
     Western Hemisphere, including within the United States.
       (7) The continuing and expanding scope of these suspected 
     attacks is impacting the security and morale of United States 
     personnel, especially those posted overseas.
       (8) The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of 
     Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons (including 
     diplomatic agents) to which 180 countries are a party, 
     protects diplomatic personnel from attacks on their persons, 
     accommodations, or means of transport, and requires all state 
     parties to punish and take measures to prevent such grave 
     crimes.
       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) the threat to United States Government personnel from 
     suspected attacks presenting as anomalous health incidents is 
     a matter of urgent concern and deserving of the full 
     attention of government;
       (2) personnel, dependents, and other appropriate 
     individuals suffering anomalous health incidents from these 
     suspected attacks deserve equitable, accessible, and high-
     quality medical assessment and care, regardless of their 
     employing Government agency;
       (3) diagnoses and determinations to treat personnel, 
     dependents, and other appropriate individuals experiencing 
     symptoms consistent with such injuries should be made by 
     experienced medical professionals and made available by the 
     Federal Government;
       (4) any recriminations, retaliation, or punishment 
     associated with personnel self-reporting symptoms is 
     unacceptable and should be investigated by internal agency 
     oversight mechanisms;
       (5) information sharing and interagency coordination is 
     essential for the comprehensive investigation, attribution, 
     and mitigation of these injuries;
       (6) the Administration should provide Congress and the 
     public with timely and regular unclassified updates on the 
     threat posed to United States Government personnel by the 
     suspected causes of these injuries;
       (7) recent efforts by the Administration and among relevant 
     agencies represent positive steps toward responding to the 
     threat of anomalous health incidents, but more comprehensive 
     measures must be taken to further assist victims, investigate 
     and determine the cause of the injuries of such victims, and 
     prevent future incidents;
       (8) establishing the source and cause of these anomalous 
     health incidents must be a top priority for the United States 
     Government and requires the full coordination of relevant 
     agencies;
       (9) if investigations determine that the anomalous health 
     incidents are the result of deliberate acts by individuals, 
     entities, or foreign countries, the United States Government 
     should recognize and respond to these incidents as hostile 
     attacks; and
       (10) any actors found to have been targeting United States 
     Government personnel should be publicly identified, as 
     appropriate, and held accountable.
       (c) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United 
     States--
       (1) to detect, deter, and punish any clandestine attacks 
     that cause persistent injuries to United States personnel;
       (2) to provide appropriate assistance to United States 
     personnel harmed by such attacks;
       (3) to hold responsible any persons, entities, or 
     governments involved in ordering or

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H5044">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H5044">H5044</a></a>]]

     carrying out such attacks, including through appropriate 
     sanctions, criminal prosecutions, or other tools;
       (4) to prioritize research into effective countermeasures 
     to help protect United States personnel from such attacks; 
     and
       (5) to convey to foreign governments through official 
     contact at the highest levels the gravity of United States 
     concern about such suspected attacks and the seriousness of 
     consequences that may follow for any actors found to be 
     involved.

         amendment no. 436 offered by mrs. torres of california

       At the end of title XIII of division A, add the following:

 Subtitle D--Central American Women and Children Protection Act of 2021

     SEC. 1331. SHORT TITLE.

       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Central American Women 
     and Children Protection Act of 2021&#x27;&#x27;.

     SEC. 1332. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds the following:
       (1) The Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, 
     Guatemala, and Honduras have among the highest homicide rates 
     in the world. In 2020, there were--
       (A) 19.7 homicides per 100,000 people in El Salvador;
       (B) 15.4 homicides per 100,000 people in Guatemala; and
       (C) 37.6 homicides per 100,000 people in Honduras.
       (2) El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras are characterized 
     by a high prevalence of drug- and gang-related violence, 
     murder, and crimes involving sexual- and gender-based 
     violence against women and children, including domestic 
     violence, child abuse, and sexual assault.
       (3) In 2019, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras were all 
     listed among the 7 countries in the Latin America and 
     Caribbean region with the highest rates of femicides (the 
     intentional killing of women or girls because of their 
     gender). In 2019--
       (A) 113 women in El Salvador were victims of femicide;
       (B) 160 women in Guatemala were victims of femicide; and
       (C) 299 women in Honduras were victims of femicide or 
     violent homicide.
       (4) In 2015, El Salvador and Honduras were among the top 3 
     countries in the world with the highest child homicides 
     rates, with more than 22 and 32 deaths per 100,000 children, 
     respectively, according to the nongovernmental organization 
     Save the Children.
       (5) Thousands of women, children, and families from El 
     Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras fled unsafe homes and 
     communities in 2019.
       (6) Violent crimes against women and children are generally 
     assumed to be substantially under-reported because the 
     majority of victims lack safe access to protection and 
     justice.
       (7) Impunity for perpetrators of violence against women is 
     rampant in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. There was a 
     5 percent conviction rate for violence against women in El 
     Salvador in 2016 and 2017. The impunity level for violence 
     against women in Guatemala was 97.05 percent in 2018. In 
     2018, there was an impunity rate of 95 percent for violence 
     against women in Honduras.
       (8) According to a study conducted by the Woodrow Wilson 
     International Center for Scholars--
       (A) childhood experiences with domestic violence in Latin 
     America are a major risk factor for future criminal behavior; 
     and
       (B) 56 percent of incarcerated women and 59 percent of 
     incarcerated men surveyed experienced intra-familial violence 
     during childhood.

     shall evaluate the tattoo policies of each Armed Force,

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from Alabama 
(Mr. Rogers) each will control 15 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume, and I urge passage of the amendments en bloc.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney),

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H5074">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H5074">H5074</a></a>]]

an outstanding member of our Conference.
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of two of my 
amendments that are included in this en bloc.
  Amendment No. 333 authorizes a long-overdue China watcher program 
within the Department of State. This program aims to monitor and combat 
Chinese malign influence across economic and political sectors in 
certain high-priority countries.
  The People&#x27;s Republic of China is challenging the United States at 
multiple levels and remains a threat to our vitally important interests 
across the globe. The threats posed by the PRC demand greater 
resources, which is exactly what this amendment delivers.
  My second amendment, No. 343, establishes a program for the 
Department of the Air Force to develop a proof-of-concept quantum 
network testbed. This will support the incredible work the Air Force is 
doing around the country, including the information directorate in 
Rome, New York, which is in the heart of my district in New York.
  The establishment of this program will deepen the military&#x27;s 
expertise in cutting-edge quantum computing. It will enable the United 
States to compete globally with our adversaries, dominate the virtual 
battlespace, and counter emerging threats.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers for the 
work they put into shepherding this bill through Congress and rejecting 
partisan cuts to our Nation&#x27;s military that were proposed by the 
administration.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this en bloc.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Steil).
  Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time of the gentleman.
  Mr. Speaker, the mishandled evacuation from Afghanistan was a tragic 
disaster. The fundamental misunderstanding of the situation on the 
ground, a faulty plan for withdrawal, and poor strategic decisionmaking 
in Washington put our troops in harm&#x27;s way, leading to the abandonment 
of American citizens and the deaths of 13 brave American 
servicemembers, including critical injuries to two marines from the 
First Congressional District of Wisconsin.
  My amendments to the national defense bill are directed at getting 
answers for our troops and the American people, and I ask my colleagues 
for their support.
  My first amendment would require the Treasury Department to report to 
Congress on the current status of the U.S. and U.N. sanctions on the 
Taliban. We must look at the current gaps in our sanctions and ensure 
that the Taliban is not able to finance their takeover by profiting 
from the drug trade and rare earth minerals.
  My second amendment would require the Treasury Department to 
regularly report to Congress on any sanctions waivers provided to allow 
transactions between financial institutions and targeted individuals.
  In addition, my amendment requires the Treasury Department to list 
out foreign banks that conduct significant transactions for persons 
that have been sanctioned for human rights abuses or corruption.
  My third amendment will hold Iran accountable. Iran has been 
emboldened. At a time when this administration is signaling that they 
intend to remove sanctions with Iran, we must ensure U.S. sanctions are 
enforced to prevent the world&#x27;s largest state sponsor of terrorism from 
obtaining a nuclear weapon.
  Congress must understand the full nature of Iran&#x27;s power and 
undertake a full audit of how Iranian-backed groups in the Iraqi 
Popular Mobilization Forces took advantage of U.S. assistance given to 
the Iraqi Government in the anti-ISIS campaign.
  Finally, I introduced an amendment with my colleague, Congresswoman 
Dean. Our bill improves intelligence coordination to combat the illicit 
financing of human trafficking.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these amendments.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany).
  Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this amendment, and I 
thank the gentleman from Alabama for the time.
  The amendment I speak of comes after many years of experiencing well-
documented U.S. Navy maintenance backlogs and deficiencies and much-
needed naval upgrades. These backlogs and deficiencies seriously 
inhibit our force-in-readiness and operational capabilities.
  Our military needs to be the readiest it can be in order to meet the 
challenges of the future, and this amendment will help do that.
  Shipyards across the country are ready, willing, and able to support 
the maintenance and upgrade requirements needed by our naval assets, 
including one in Superior, Wisconsin, in my congressional district.
  These non-homeport shipyards can support vital surge capacity, 
addressing maintenance needs that cannot always be addressed in a 
timely fashion at homeports. This change will also support good family-
wage jobs across the country.
  Mr. Speaker, I am really pleased to have worked with Representative 
Stauber just across the border on this amendment. It is so important. 
By utilizing those people who work in the twin ports of Superior and 
Duluth, with their exceptional workmanship that they provide for 
shipbuilding on the Great Lakes, I think this makes this amendment very 
worthy.

  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), my friend and colleague and a 
real leader on the Committee on Energy and Commerce.
  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Alabama for 
yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise to express concerns with the Thompson amendment 
No. 427. The amendment requires the Department of Homeland Security, 
DHS, to establish a medical countermeasures program for preparedness 
and response capabilities. It also requires DHS to maintain and pre-
position a stockpile of medical countermeasures.
  After dealing with the ongoing pandemic for the past year and a half, 
we can all appreciate the necessity of being prepared to deal with 
these threats. However, this new program is completely duplicative of 
existing initiatives at HHS.
  Currently, under HHS, the Strategic National Stockpile, or SNS, is 
part of the Federal medical response infrastructure for such attacks. 
The Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise 
determines optimal allocation of resources and organization of the 
stockpile to best address high-priority threats.
  This interagency coordination already includes the input of the 
Department of Homeland Security and coordinates Federal efforts to 
combat these threats. While I do believe we should evaluate our 
country&#x27;s pandemic response given the COVID-19 pandemic, we do not need 
to create a duplicative program that will only lead to confusion and 
hinder coordination.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the 
balance of my time.

                              {time}  1830

  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, again, I want to state this en bloc package was reached 
in close coordination between the majority and minority. I urge its 
favorable support, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I also support the en bloc. 
This will be the last chance for me to speak before we conclude the 
amendment process, so I do just want to make a final pitch for the 
underlying piece of legislation.
  I think the amendment process has gone just fine. The underlying bill 
is incredibly well put together in the manner we have described, has 
bipartisan support, reflects a lot of the ideas and priorities of 
Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle as well, and from even 
outside the committee.

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H5075">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H5075">H5075</a></a>]]

  I think we have an excellent piece of legislation that will help meet 
the national security needs of our country, and I urge support for the 
bill in the final passage process, which will happen at some point 
tomorrow after we vote on, I don&#x27;t know, 18-20 amendments, something 
like that. We will be here awhile.
  Don&#x27;t forget what brought us here in the first place. The need to 
pass the National Defense Authorization Act and maintain our commitment 
to put the men and women who serve in the military in the best possible 
position to carry out the missions that we give them.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for final passage of the bill and urge 
support for this en bloc amendment, and I yield back the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, in the spirit of transparency 
and accountability my amendment directs the Government Accountability 
Office (GAO) to probe whether the Department of Defense ever weaponized 
ticks with Lyme disease or any other dangerous pathogen.
  Two similar amendments I have offered--one for an investigation by 
the Inspector General and another by the GAO--previously passed the 
House but did not make it through the Senate. I offer it again as the 
investigation and research may help uncover decades-old information and 
possibly provide some answers for those that suffer from Lyme. 
Americans deserve the truth.
  For years, books and articles have been written credibly asserting 
that significant research at Fort Detrick, Plum Island, and elsewhere 
was conducted to turn ticks into bioweapons.
  In her book, ``Bitten: The Secret History of Lyme Disease and 
Biological Weapons,&#x27;&#x27; Kris Newby includes interviews with Dr. Willy 
Burgdorfer, the researcher who is credited with discovering Lyme 
disease. It turns out that Dr. Burgdorfer was a bioweapons specialist. 
The interviews, combined with access to Dr. Burgdorfer&#x27;s files, reveal 
that he and other bioweapons specialists stuffed ticks with pathogens 
in a quest to cause severe disability, disease, and death.
  Mr. Speaker, Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases are exploding 
in the United States. According to the December 2020 report of the 
Health & Human Services&#x27; Tick-Borne Disease Working Group--a federal 
advisory committee created by language included in the 21st Century 
Cures Act, which I fought for--Lyme disease is the most common tick-
borne disease with an estimated 300,000 new cases diagnosed each year. 
A figure that many researchers, and Lyme-literate doctors, believe is 
underreported and could be upwards of 476,000 cases each year.
  I also might add that this threat is very real for our servicemembers 
as they train in the field, especially at Fort Dix in my district where 
the geographic area has an increased prevalence of Lyme. To stop the 
spread of these horrific tickborne diseases, we must first understand 
their origins and how they came to be so pervasive.
  Mr. Speaker, my amendment tasks the GAO to ask the hard questions 
about DOD&#x27;s bioweapons research on ticks from 1950 to 1977. What were 
the parameters of the program if there was one? Who ordered it? Was 
there any accidental release anywhere or at any time of any of the 
diseased ticks? And the most important question, can any of this 
information that might be derived from that study, that audit, help 
current day researchers find a way to mitigate these diseases?
  10 to 20 percent of Americans with Lyme suffer with chronic Lyme 
disease. They have a right to know whether any of this is true, and if 
any old research documents could be applied by current-day scientists 
to finding a better diagnostic or treatment for Lyme disease--something 
that&#x27;s desperately needed.
  If the investigation concludes our government&#x27;s bioweapons program 
did not contribute to the proliferation of Lyme, we tum the page. And 
if it did, hopefully this investigation and research will contribute to 
a cure.
  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act which would deliver 
a win-win-win for stormwater-stressed ecosystems; the military; and 
communities, like Hampton Roads, that host military installations. I 
was pleased to introduce this bipartisan amendment with support from my 
Hampton Roads colleagues, Representatives Luria and Wittman, as well as 
Representatives Sarbanes and Brown from Maryland and Representative 
Mace from South Carolina.
  Flooding that occurs on and around bases jeopardizes military 
readiness and compounds the stress of military families. In addition to 
causing flooding, stormwater also remains a stubborn source of 
pollution in the Chesapeake Bay, complicating the ongoing work to 
restore this national treasure. For that reason, I introduced this 
amendment to enhance both community resilience and the health of 
waterways.
  As rainwater falls on and travels across pavement and other 
impermeable surfaces, it picks up all kinds of things--nutrients from 
lawn fertilizer, pet waste, sediments, and chemicals that pollute the 
Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Because climate change and 
unchecked emissions are heating up our atmosphere and oceans, extreme 
precipitation events and deadly storms, like Ida, have become more 
severe. In addition to more frequent and severe precipitation events on 
land, climate change-driven sea level rise also wreaks havoc on coastal 
stormwater systems, especially during high tide.
  My amendment would help address the growing threat stormwater poses 
by expanding the authorization of existing infrastructure and 
resilience programs to help slow, store, and filter stormwater on 
military bases and in the communities that host them. Through the 
implementation of low impact design and installation of stormwater 
management features like stormwater ponds, rain gardens, permeable 
pavement, cisterns, and tree boxes, my amendment will reduce the stress 
on water infrastructure and address both the issue of flooding and 
stormwater pollution.
  The military recognizes climate change as the ``threat multiplier&#x27;&#x27; 
that it is and I am grateful for the Department of Defense&#x27;s 
partnership in the coordinated effort to restore the Chesapeake Bay. 
This amendment will provide the military the authorization it needs to 
integrate its work to enhance mission readiness with its work to 
protect the communities and watersheds in which installations are 
situated.
  While we continue to work to enhance resilience in Hampton Roads and 
beyond, we must also work to rapidly mitigate emissions and protect 
precious carbon sinks--like the Chesapeake Bay--to avoid the worst of 
the climate crisis.
  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment in en bloc number 
four.

            Amendment No. 241 Offered by Ms. Leger Fernandez

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
241 printed in part C of <a href="/congressional-report/117th-congress/house-report/125">House Report 117-125</a>.
  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Add at the end of title LX of division E the following:

     SEC. ___. AMENDMENT TO RADIATION EXPOSURE COMPENSATION ACT.

       Section 2(a)(1) of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act 
     (Public Law 101-426; 42 U.S.C. 2210 note) is amended by 
     inserting ``, including individuals in New Mexico, Idaho, 
     Colorado, Arizona, Utah, Texas, Wyoming, Oregon, Washington, 
     South Dakota, North Dakota, Nevada, Guam, and the Northern 
     Mariana Islands,&#x27;&#x27; after ``tests exposed individuals&#x27;&#x27;.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez) and a Member opposed 
each will control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Mexico.
  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, everyone knows the first atomic 
bomb was exploded at the Trinity Site in New Mexico. In fact, between 
1945 and 1992, the United States Government conducted more than 200 
aboveground nuclear tests. These tests exposed nearby communities and 
the people living and working in those communities to radiation.
  As a result of the exposure, tens of thousands of downwinders 
contracted cancers and other diseases. In 1999, in recognition of this 
exposure, Congress passed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act to 
provide a one-time payment to many of these individuals

[[<a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H5076">Page <a href="/congressional-record/volume-167/house-section/page/H5076">H5076</a></a>]]

in addition to the uranium miners, millers, and transporters.
  Unfortunately, downwinders in many States, including my beautiful 
State of New Mexico, were not included and left to deal with the health 
effects of these explosions, like the very first bomb, on their own.
  I recently met with Tina Cordova and members of the Tularosa Basin 
Downwinder Coalition. They told me the stories of their loved ones who 
died as a result of these tests. They have fought for so long for the 
government to simply recognize them and their pain. We do hear their 
voices, we see their pain, and now we must act.
  It is not just New Mexicans that have suffered, it is people from 
Washington to the Dakotas to Texas, and all the way to Guam.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support amendment No. 241, and provide an apology to individuals in New 
Mexico, Idaho, Colorado, Arizona, Utah, Texas, Wyoming, Oregon, 
Washington, South Dakota, North Dakota, Nevada, Guam, and the Northern 
Mariana Islands, who were exposed to radiation during the government&#x27;s 
nuclear testing.
  Identical language was included in the House-passed National Defense 
Authorization Acts for both 2019 and 2020.
  It is past time for Congress to begin to acknowledge the harm nuclear 
testing caused to these communities by passing this amendment. Our 
government owes these communities a formal apology. Let&#x27;s do that.
  My amendment is supported by Members on both sides of the aisle, and 
I urge my colleagues to vote for it, and I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California is recognized 
for 5 minutes.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, near the end of World War II, the United 
Stated detonated the first atomic weapon at the Trinity Test Site in 
New Mexico.
  Between this first test in 1945 and 1963, the United States did 
conduct nearly 200 atmospheric, that is aboveground, atomic weapons 
tests. These activities and other aspects of our atomic weapons program 
may indeed have led to cancer in some people and other radiation-
related illnesses.
  That is why, in 1990, Congress passed the Radiation Exposure 
Compensation Act, or RECA, to provide restitution to these individuals. 
This would add to RECA an apology to individuals in many States. Now, 
notably, this amendment would extend an apology to individuals residing 
in States not even eligible for compensation under the current terms of 
RECA.
  After Congress last extended and expanded RECA in 2000, the National 
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine studied the effect of 
nuclear weapons tests on the health of surrounding populations. This 
study concluded, ``the scientific evidence indicates that in most cases 
it is unlikely that exposure to radiation from fallout was a 
substantial contributing cause to developing cancer.&#x27;&#x27;
  Simply put, the science does not support the assertion that atomic 
weapons testing caused widespread instances of cancer. Despite this 
finding, the amendment before us would declare that U.S. atomic weapons 
testing caused cancer in individuals in New Mexico, Idaho, Colorado, 
Arizona, Utah, Texas, Wyoming, Oregon, Washington, South Dakota, North 
Dakota, Nevada, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands.
  The Democrats are fond of saying we must follow the science when they 
forbid Americans from going to work or children from attending school 
or families from attending church. I wish they would actually follow 
the science not only when they find it politically convenient, but when 
they find it politically inconvenient.
  Any change to RECA must be fully considered by the Judiciary 
Committee to ensure that compensation is only provided for illnesses 
that can be reasonably traced to activities of the U.S. Government.
  On a personal note, I would add that my father, in 1945, was serving 
in the 88th Infantry Division in Italy. They were under orders to 
prepare to ship out for the invasion of the Japanese mainland. That 
invasion would have created a slaughter on both sides unimaginable to 
history.
  The development of this weapon prevented that from occurring and 
saved countless Japanese and American lives and the slaughter that 
would have otherwise unfolded. That is not something I intend to 
apologize for.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, precisely because of the importance 
of those atomic tests and the impact on the people of New Mexico, which 
we all recognize was the very first test of an atomic bomb, and the 
importance that it played in our history, and the ending of World War 
II.
  What we are asking for, at the very least, is an apology not for the 
bomb, but for the impact; the impact that it had on those lives of 
those people in those communities who are people that I know. They are 
grandparents and children, they are my neighbors. And I believe, that 
at the very least, we must apologize to those who we left out of RECA 
for the impact that they suffered with regards to their health.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

435 printed in part C of <a href="/congressional-report/117th-congress/house-report/125">House Report 117-125</a>.
  Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, I would like to present my 
amendment No. 435.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

         amendment no. 435 offered by mrs. torres of california

       At the end of title LX of division E, add the following:

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to <a href="/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/667">House Resolution 667</a>, the 
gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.
  Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
amendment--a very simple amendment. My amendment seeks to restore 
congressional notification requirements on a category of munitions 
export licenses.
  For decades, when a U.S. company wanted to export these munitions, 
the sale required authorization from the Federal Government. The State 
Department has the responsibility for issuing approvals for most types 
of weapons once it has assessed any impact on our national security or 
our foreign policy.
  The State Department was also required to notify Congress every time 
it approved a license. Unfortunately, the Trump administration changed 
all of this. It moved the licensing of firearms export sales from the 
State Department to the Department of Commerce, and it changed the 
standard review process.
  They also ended the congressional notification process. The 
Department of Commerce is not currently required to notify Congress 
when they issue a munitions export license.
  I strongly opposed those changes.
  Given the serious national security implications of foreign munitions 
sales and the possibility that those weapons could end up in the wrong 
hands, Congress has a clear policy interest in understanding when they 
occur.
  This amendment will restore those notification requirements by 
mandating that the Department of Commerce follow the same procedure and 
guidelines that was in place prior to that change.
  Frankly, I am surprised that anyone is objecting to restoring 
longstanding congressional oversight powers.
  I hope my colleagues will support my amendment to ensure that foreign 
munitions sales receive the careful scrutiny they deserve.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes&#x27;&#x27; vote on this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment, and I 
am opposed to the legislation.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is 
recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, on January 23, 2020, President Trump carried 
forward an initiative that had begun in 2010 focused on improving 
processes for reviewing arms exports, including making necessary 
updates to the United States Munitions List. Specifically, the items 
that moved fell within the category of firearms, for sure, however, 
only certain items were moved, not all.
  The State Department retains oversight of those defense articles and 
services that provide a critical military or intelligence advantage or, 
in the case of weapons, are inherently for military end use.
  Now, what does that mean?
  That means fully automatic firearms and modern artillery, silencers, 
components, parts, and accessories specifically designed for automatic 
firearms remain on the munitions list under State Department 
jurisdiction. These are still subject to congressional notification 
requirements as appropriate.
  For the items that were moved to Commerce, their export still 
requires authorization, but under Commerce Department regulations.
  Just keep in mind, Mr. Speaker, we compete. Even arms manufacturers 
in the United States still have to compete globally. Now, we can either 
sell American arms to our allies, or we can have them go shop with 
Russia or China. That would be great.
  Now, the Department of Commerce has been regulating exports of 
shotguns and specific types of ammunitions for decades and continues to 
do so today. For goodness&#x27; sake, even President Biden, who really 
doesn&#x27;t have a clue about weapons, recommended that we all get a 
shotgun, didn&#x27;t he? He said that.
  The House Foreign Affairs Committee has the ability and 
responsibility to request any licenses or authorizations approved or 
denied by Commerce, pursuant to the Export Control Reform Act passed in 
August of 2018. To date, there has not been any inappropriate licenses 
issued for any of these items to any entities--none.
  Moreover, no Member has even requested licensing information from 
Commerce since this shift. There just simply has not been any problem.
  Mr. Speaker, this is a solution that is looking for a problem. There 
isn&#x27;t a problem. There is no basis for this amendment as it directly 
contradicts the spirit of this regulatory change. Shifting this 
regulatory function to Commerce does not and never has governed the 
illicit transfer of firearms.
  This is about the illicit transfer of firearms. If we wanted to get 
to the illicit transfer of firearms, and my colleagues on the other 
side were really serious about that, they would be interested to find 
out what ever happened with Fast and Furious. That was an illicit 
transfer of firearms.
  This amendment falsely claims to address illicit transfer of 
firearms. This is not an amendment that will address that.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, we can reserve the debate 
whether the State Department or the Commerce Department should have 
jurisdiction over gun sale exports.
  This amendment is not about that. This amendment is very simple. It 
restores a longstanding requirement to notify Congress--a notification. 
That is not dictating to anyone where they should sell or whom they 
should sell weapons to. Simply report to Congress.
  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully request a ``yes&#x27;&#x27; vote on this amendment, 
and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I just want to reiterate that the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee--that is a committee in Congress. That is 
Congress, by the way. That is what Congress is.
  The House Foreign Affairs Committee can request and has the 
authorization to approve or deny these exports pursuant to the Export 
Control Reform Act passed in August of 2018. It is already covered. All 
we are doing is adding redundancy. All we are doing is making it more 
difficult if we pass this for us to sell our allies things that they 
want to have from us and we want to sell to them.
  Why would we make that more difficult? It seems to me we want to help 
our allies and our allies want to help us.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                              {time}  2050
